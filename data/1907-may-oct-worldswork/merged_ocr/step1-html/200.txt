Who built the Alamance Cotton Mill. His descendants now own<br/>
mills aggregating <span style="color: #ff0000;">6,144 </span>looms and 161,000 spindles<br/>
<br/>
of the state governments, the mills are beginning a campaign for immigration. Last winter<br/>
the North German Lloyd steamer <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witlekind<br/>
</span>landed at Charleston with more than 400<br/>
steerage passengers.<br/>
<br/>
The markets for cotton goods are constantly<br/>
increasing. For the six years from 1885 to 1891<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>THE COTTON MILLS AND <span style="color: #ff0000;">THE </span>PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
the average yearly consumption of cotton was<br/>
8,670,000 bales. During the next six years<br/>
it was 10,849,000 bales. From 1897 to 1902<br/>
the average had grown to be 13,398,000. For<br/>
the six years ending in 1908, it will have risen<br/>
to more than 15,000,000. Even with this consumption the United States Department of<br/>
Agriculture estimates that only <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span>'s population regularly wear clothes,<br/>
that half are partially clad, and that the rest<br/>
habitually go almost naked.<br/>
<br/>
Since 1880, enough cotton mills have been<br/>
erected in the cotton-growing states to spin<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">2,000,000 </span>bales of cotton. Yet that has not<br/>
kept pace with the increased demand. The<br/>
mills in other parts of the United States have<br/>
increased during that time 28 per cent., and<br/>
in England and on the continent of Europe<br/>
they are still building mills. The increase in<br/>
the use of cotton cloth will continue until it<br/>
covers the millions now <span style="color: #0000FF;">unclothed</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE COMING REVOLUTION IN POWER SUPPLY<br/>
<br/>
But there is one influence pointing to the<br/>
future prosperity of the mills in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cottongrowing </span>states which does not affect the other<br/>
great mill centres to anything like the same<br/>
degree. At Whitney, N. C., a <span style="color: #0000FF;">333-yard </span>dam<br/>
is being built across the Yadkin River to turn<br/>
1,700 cubic feet of water into a <span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mile </span>canal.<br/>
At the end of the canal will be a fall <span style="color: #ff0000;">two-thirds<br/>
