<br/>
</span>inspired the sobriquet of "Lubber," but heavy<br/>
bodies are capable of much momentum.<br/>
One early observed that there was no inertia<br/>
about slow-plodding "Lub" Taft. His solemn<br/>
earnestness was steam, was power, and his<br/>
curiosity was a most indefatigable <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stoker</span>.<br/>
With self-mockery beaming in his eyes, though<br/>
with a certain quaint gravity, he used to announce that he had decided to be President<br/>
when the slight obstacle of few years was once<br/>
remedied.<br/>
<br/>
One morning in school he raised his hand<br/>
eagerly; the teacher recognized the hand, and<br/>
the chubby little "buster" of eleven had the<br/>
floor.<br/>
<br/>
"The imperial yak," he announced, "has<br/>
gone through the Canal!"<br/>
<br/>
He meant "yacht," the first vessel to pass<br/>
through Suez. And now he is digging a canal<br/>
himself, between two other continents<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>That imperial "<span style="color: #0000FF;">yak</span>," however, does indicate<br/>
how keenly sensitive he was to history in the<br/>
making. As for history ready-made, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">pored<br/>
</span>over it voraciously. One does not, however,<br/>
gather the idea that he was a bookworm. A<br/>
man, who as a boy lived next door, recalls him<br/>
curled up into a ball on the window seat,<br/>
devouring a novel of Scott's. But then, what<br/>
boy <span style="color: #0000FF;">would</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n't</span>? And, besides, he was not<br/>
gormandizing. Nor was he any little priggish<br/>
"grind" in his school. He simply labored<br/>
away at each lesson until he got it, -and then<br/>
the kernel of knowledge within was his forever<br/>
after. Whereupon he burst out to play.<br/>
<br/>
HIS EARLY YEARS IN MT. AUBURN<br/>
<br/>
Taft was a field and pasture boy. He was<br/>
as wholesomely remote from the rough as<br/>
from the milk-and-water type; nor later, when<br/>
"feeling his oats," did he bluster about sowing<br/>
any of them. Mt. Auburn was sparsely<br/>
settled then, and Cincinnati was yet too young<br/>
to offer the vices of a big city. The Mt.<br/>
Auburn <span style="color: #ff0000;">youngsters-mow </span>lawyers, judges, and<br/>
solid merchants-reed in the open. At<br/>
night or on rainy Saturday afternoons, the old<br/>
billiard table in the Taft'home served better<br/>
than a parental frown. These boys needed<br/>
nothing so little as a pool-room, and they never<br/>
did need to "loaf." As for the present Secretary of War, they all say that he has not scattered enough "wild oats" to feed a mustang<br/>
colt.<br/>
<br/>
There was a hollow below Mt. Auburn on<br/>
either side, one being popularly known as<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TAFT</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>A CAREER OF BIG TASKS<br/>
<br/>
Butchertown and the other as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tailortown</span>.<br/>
Whenever the Ridge "gang" (Mt. Auburn)<br/>
got tired among themselves, as with greenapple battles in the Taft orchard, they could<br/>
always pick a fight with either of the hollow<br/>
"gangs," and just possibly there were rocks<br/>
thrown. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taft</span>, as you may have guessed<br/>
already from the inevitable in biography, was<br/>
of course the leader. The boys themselves,<br/>
though, took it as the most natural thing in<br/>
the world. He was only coming into his own,<br/>
by this activity. "Bill" was a fellow they<br/>
could back up, and they felt this <span style="color: #0000FF;">instinctively</span>. Moreover, they had a love for him, a love<br/>
that has endured to this day; it grows evident<br/>
in the tone of their voices when they speak of<br/>
"Old Bill." A prosperous merchant of<br/>
Cincinnati said quite simply that he would<br/>
lend to "Bill" Taft the very last cent<br/>
he had, and with never a scrap of paper<br/>
to show for it. Another, a lawyer, observed<br/>
just as simply that "Bill" Taft could not be<br/>
budged or bought by the "six hundred, or<br/>
however many billions of dollars there happens to be in the whole United States."<br/>
They were reared with him, these two. And<br/>
when they and a half-score others tell of him<br/>
as a boy, their trust in him and their abiding<br/>
affection for him are no longer strange, but<br/>
are a rebuke to all misanthropes.<br/>
<br/>
Then and since, they say, it was a char<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">acteristic </span>of Taft never to utter a word against<br/>
<br/>
anyone who was absent. If he could say<br/>
nothing good, you would see in his worried<br/>
blue eyes that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>trying to think of something to the absent one's credit with which<br/>
to breast the drift of scandal. As for telling<br/>
on another, he would take "a licking" first.<br/>
His full brothers, Henry and Horace, were of<br/>
the same stripe, and it is remembered that one<br/>
of the three was suspended from school for a<br/>
prank that others had played. Judge Taft,<br/>
their father, <span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>the strap, thinking he had<br/>
the real culprit in hand, and the young gentleman accepted the "thrashing" without a word.<br/>
<br/>
TAFT AS A GENUINE BOY<br/>
<br/>
"Bill" Taft was thoroughly a boy-a big,<br/>
clean, honest, out-and-out boy. Such a bigboned, stout, happy fellow was bound to come<br/>
in for nicknames, and he has always had them,<br/>
from the time the neighborhood dubbed him<br/>
"Lub" until he was "Santo Taft" to the<br/>
Filipinos. The Mt. Auburn youngsters also<br/>
called him "Lead-Head-and-Cotton-Body,"<br/>
<br/>
