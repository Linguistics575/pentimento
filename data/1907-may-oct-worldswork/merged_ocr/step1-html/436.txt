THE CONTROL OF DESTRUCTIVE FERMENTS<br/>
<br/>
Every vital process, whether it be the absorption of oxygen by the blood corpuscles in<br/>
the lungs, or the digestion of starches, or the<br/>
abstraction of urea from the blood by the<br/>
kidneys, or repair of the body in any way, is<br/>
secured through the action of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Ordinarily, ferments <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>destructive; but brilliant<br/>
discoveries have shown the existence of constructive ferments. Every one knows that a<br/>
large dose of certain drugs will poison, while<br/>
small amounts stimulate. Ferments behave<br/>
in the same way. Add malt to starch and it<br/>
will become glucose. Add sugar to this and<br/>
it will change back to starch<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">q<br/>
<br/>
</span>The nature of these physiological ferments<br/>
is largely a mystery at the present time; but<br/>
some of them are being chemically imitated,<br/>
and the next step will be to learn how so to<br/>
balance the constructive against the destructive<br/>
ferments in the body that, instead of progressive decay of the upbuilding cells by destroying ferments, they can continue equalizing<br/>
loss and repair. Aside from the destructive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of certain ferments, there is apparently<br/>
no limit in the years of growth capacity of<br/>
cells, which is another great mystery. Possibly<br/>
the gradual weakening of the body is not due<br/>
to an increase in the amount of destructive<br/>
ferments, but to a weakening production of the<br/>
constructive ferments. The lines of attack<br/>
will not materially change. Nature is nowhere<br/>
so prodigal as in her supply of reproductive<br/>
cells, and for every being created there are<br/>
thousands of such cells destroyed. Under wild<br/>
conditions, a large percentage of fruits and<br/>
berries produced fall in early decay, or remain<br/>
stunted. The skilful horticulturist can work<br/>
such adjustments through ferments as greatly to<br/>
avoid such failures and add to the quality of<br/>
the total crop. What could be accomplished<br/>
with man, if he could be bred and trained under<br/>
the same "controls" that are so successfully<br/>
applied with fine stock?<br/>
<br/>
It is evident that one of the pivotal points<br/>
is the meaning of the word fermentation, for in<br/>
it lie many of the fundamental problems of<br/>
Physio-chemistry. A whole page might be<br/>
filled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">definitions </span>of the word. We might<br/>
<br/>
BE LENGTHENED?<br/>
<br/>
say that it is the perpetual quest of matter for<br/>
an equilibrial rest that is never <span style="color: #ff0000;">sustainedo1aturally </span>not sustained, for equilibrium is<br/>
never a state of rest. The crane can sleep on<br/>
one leg, but his muscles are in constant tension.<br/>
All particles of matter are very positive in their<br/>
tendency either to unite, or to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fly </span>apart. That<br/>
is probably the ultimate electrical status of all<br/>
matter. These particles are more or less bound<br/>
up in temporary wedlock, but constantly <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjected </span>to temptation to divorce through the<br/>
machinations of the ferments.<br/>
<br/>
Ferments hold somewhat the same relation<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">combination</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of matter that a trigger holds<br/>
to the charge in a gun. Just why a given<br/>
element, that which acts as a ferment, should<br/>
so <span style="color: #0000FF;">act-we </span>do not know. Hydrogen and<br/>
oxygen will dwell together in perfect harmony,<br/>
work together, sleep in the same bed; but the<br/>
instant the slightest bit of platinum sponge<br/>
crawls into the bed, there is a violent <span style="color: #0000FF;">explosion</span>.<br/>
Why? As the honest pupil says: "Teacher,<br/>
that's as far as my lesson goes."<br/>
<br/>
In the world of living matter the development<br/>
of ferments is universal, and it is caused either<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">bacteria-them/es </span>created by it-or<br/>
through the specialized secretions of various<br/>
glands. Bacteria hold this unique relation to<br/>
our lives, that too much of them means death,<br/>
and too little of them means death. Evidently the delicacy of the situation calls for<br/>
much tact and diplomacy in adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
CAN THE LIFE PROCESSES BE REVERSED?<br/>
<br/>
We cannot conceive of time running backward, but many machines can do so; and,<br/>
strange to relate, certain living creatures have<br/>
shown the whole process of upbuilding reversed.<br/>
Likewise, it was discovered by Hill that the<br/>
ferments are reversible and can make a given<br/>
process retrace its ground. Here is another<br/>
"basic principle" discovered. Now, from this<br/>
shall we picture the old man looking less<br/>
wrinkled, to-morrow, straightening up in his<br/>
walk, brightening in his dull eye, steadying<br/>
in his quaking hand, filling the hollowed cheek<br/>
and neck, discarding the past for the future<br/>
tense, moving from year to year backward<br/>
into the bloom of elasticity, hopefulness, <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthusia'sm</span>, and freshness of youth; and shall we<br/>
run riot in our imaginings and follow this<br/>
glowing <span style="color: #ff0000;">youthdom </span>into the perspective of<br/>
babyhood until it passes out of focal gaze?<br/>
Or shall we run yet more riot and picture the<br/>
lever thrown to its centre-life change brought<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
