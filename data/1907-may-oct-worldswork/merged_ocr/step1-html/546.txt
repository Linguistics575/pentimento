The heaviest previous expenditure on these<br/>
two arms of the Empire was in the year 1901,<br/>
when $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">66</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500,000 </span>was sunk in preparation for<br/>
war. In this current year, the appropriation<br/>
is, as stated above, more than $ 97,000,000.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how does this burden of expenditure<br/>
fall upon the people? The expenditures of<br/>
the United States in 1906 totalled an average<br/>
of $ 9.20 per inhabitant. Is the burden heavier<br/>
in the United States than in Japan? The<br/>
Government of Japan has not given out the<br/>
figures of the national wealth, or the national<br/>
income, per inhabitant. For that reason, only<br/>
a very rough idea is obtainable to guide the<br/>
student to a conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
The average yearly compensation of the<br/>
American laborer in manufacturing pursuits<br/>
is close upon $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">47 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span>, or nearly $ 1.60 per working<br/>
day. By way of comparison, the average<br/>
daily wages of the Japanese laborer make<br/>
interesting reading. The carpenter in Japan<br/>
makes 30 cents a day; the stone-cutter, 33; the<br/>
brick-maker, 27%; the paper-hanger, 28; the<br/>
jeweler, 26; the founder, <span style="color: #ff0000;">26</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">%</span>; the printer, 19,<br/>
and so on down the list. If the farm-laborer<br/>
succeeds in making for himself a yearly contract<br/>
he will receive for his twelve-months' work<br/>
$ 18.74. His wife or daughter will go into the<br/>
same service for $ 10.06. The monthly wages<br/>
of a female servant in Japan for the year 1906<br/>
averaged <span style="color: #ff0000;">891</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>cents.<br/>
<br/>
The great factories of Japan employed in<br/>
1905, 587,851 persons. Of these, 347,563, or<br/>
60 per cent., were female. Nearly 37,000 girls<br/>
under 14 years of age toiled with their hands<br/>
in these mills, working an average of 14 hours<br/>
a day for the sum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>cents per diem. This<br/>
is the factory record. But, scattered over the<br/>
Empire, there are nearly half a million houses<br/>
in which weaving is carried on. In them there<br/>
labored in the year 1905 more than 767,000<br/>
operatives-and of these 731,000 were women<br/>
and young girls. The average earning capacity<br/>
of a female weaver in Japan is only nine cents<br/>
a day.<br/>
<br/>
Is it any wonder that the burden of that<br/>
terrible national debt weighs heavily upon the<br/>
people? For everything is taxed in Japan.<br/>
The normal tax on land is 2% per cent. of its<br/>
assessed value. An income tax is levied on<br/>
all incomes over $ 150 per annum, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">trifling<br/>
</span>exceptions. All business is taxed, sometimes<br/>
in three or four different ways. Liquors,<br/>
sugar, patent medicines, mining tools, traveling<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>are taxed directly. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">indirect </span>tax<br/>
<br/>
THE PERIL <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
through customs dues amounts to an average<br/>
of more than 15 per cent. Tobacco, salt,<br/>
and camphor <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>monopolized by the Government-and the people pay. Under the extraordinary special tax schedule-which the Government now admits is to be permanent-the land<br/>
taxes were greatly increased; the business taxes<br/>
were advanced to half as much again as before;<br/>
the income tax was greatly increased, and all<br/>
other taxes were advanced.<br/>
<br/>
On top of this rests the burden of the change<br/>
that is so swiftly going on in the commercial<br/>
world. In the first few <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">after</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the end of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Feudalism</span>, the people turned individually to<br/>
the task of earning a living. They became<br/>
fishermen, farmers, merchants, and even manufacturers in a very small way. But the march<br/>
of time has brought the little individual into<br/>
competition'with organizations of capital, with<br/>
fishing companies on a large scale, with great<br/>
mercantile houses, with factories that can turn<br/>
out superior workmanship at a fraction of the<br/>
cost in time and labor.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, these matters may in time remedy<br/>
themselves. When the rice harvest <span style="color: #0000FF;">and.the<br/>
</span>fisheries are both successful the people can<br/>
struggle along. If they should both fail in<br/>
any one year no man can guess the result.<br/>
Meantime, the rich men and corporations who<br/>
monopolize the industries grow richer. They<br/>
bring into Japan the comforts and luxuries of<br/>
the Occident. But the mere perusal of the<br/>
list of wages paid to workmen will show that<br/>
the lower classes of Japan cannot, under<br/>
existing conditions, become consumers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>goods even in the smallest quantities.<br/>
<br/>
Enough has been said to show how critical<br/>
is the economic position of the Japanese Empire<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day</span>, and to explain why the United States,<br/>
Canada, and even Korea and China are eagerly<br/>
sought by the Japanese. The people have<br/>
acquired a taste for the life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Occident.<br/>
They cannot gratify that taste <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the money<br/>
that can be made in Japan. They seek the<br/>
lands where labor is paid a higher wage.<br/>
<br/>
If the an.nual report of the Minister of<br/>
Finance indicates one thing more strongly than<br/>
another, it is that if the late war had lasted six<br/>
months longer it would have left Japan <span style="color: #0000FF;">bankrupt</span>. Within the next two years, the budget of<br/>
the Empire must be cut down by perhaps<br/>
$ 100,000,000 a year or Japan will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">permanently </span>crippled. The economists of the world<br/>
look with anxiety for the preliminary estimates<br/>
of the next national budget.<br/>
