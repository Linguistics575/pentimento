tion with the strikers, walked into Mr. Frick's<br/>
private office, drew a revolver, and fired. The<br/>
bullet lodged in Mr. Frick's neck. Mr. Frick<br/>
rushed at him, and a second bullet stopped him.<br/>
Struggling to his knees, Mr. Frick grappled<br/>
with him. In. the struggle, Berkmann stabbed<br/>
him three times in the side and thigh. But<br/>
Mr. Frick at length downed his larger assailant<br/>
and held him until the police came. When<br/>
the doctors probed his wounds, Mr. Frick<br/>
directed them to the bullets. Then, lying on<br/>
a sofa, he completed the business he had had in<br/>
hand when the struggle began, before he allowed<br/>
the doctors to carry him home. Thirteen days<br/>
later he walked into his office unattended, and<br/>
resumed the work of fighting the strike. His<br/>
doctors ascribe his quick recovery to his tremendous force of <span style="color: #0000FF;">will</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The strikers were not yet beaten. Through<br/>
the summer, and until November <span style="color: #0000FF;">arst</span>, the<br/>
battle raged. The leader was unmoved<br/>
equally by the renewal of violence, the protests<br/>
of the public, and the distress of the families<br/>
of the strikers. He won, and apparently he<br/>
has never begrudged the price of victory. The<br/>
issues raised and the public passions aroused<br/>
by his prolonged battle helped defeat Benjamin Harrison for President. This defeat<br/>
brought him the bitter hatred of the Republican leaders. But throughout the storm<br/>
Mr. Frick was the Silent Man, satisfied that<br/>
he had done the thing he started out to do.<br/>
<br/>
BREACH WITH MR. CARNEGIE<br/>
<br/>
His success had in it the seeds of discord<br/>
between himself and Mr. Carnegie. Much<br/>
as Mr. Carnegie complimented him upon his<br/>
great services to the company, he could not<br/>
fail to realize that Mr. Frick had won a<br/>
place of greater power in the Carnegie <span style="color: #0000FF;">Company </span>than any other man besides Mr. Carnegie<br/>
had ever had. The compliments took this form<br/>
upon Mr. Carnegie's return to Pittsburg early<br/>
in 1893, in a public statement issued by him:<br/>
"And now a word about <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frick</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
</span>Of his ability, fairness, and pluck no one has<br/>
the slightest question. His four years' management stamps him as one of the foremost<br/>
managers of the world. I would not exchange<br/>
him for any manager I know." Six years<br/>
later, when Mr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frick </span>tried to buy out Mr.<br/>
Carnegie's interests, Mr. Carnegie resented<br/>
the menace to his supremacy and tried to oust<br/>
Mr. Frick bodily from the business.<br/>
<br/>
But for the moment peace was upon the steel<br/>
<br/>
FRICK, THE SILENT<br/>
<br/>
industry. Mr. Frick returned to the task<br/>
of making the Carnegie Steel Company,<br/>
Limited, preeminent in the world's steel<br/>
markets. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>step toward that <span style="color: #0000FF;">achievement </span>was to weld closer together the scattered<br/>
plants of the company. This he did by building the Union Railway, which connects all the<br/>
plants with one another and with the railroad<br/>
lines entering Pittsburg. This road made it<br/>
easy to handle and distribute the 16,000,000<br/>
tons of freight annually originated by the<br/>
company. The saving in switching charges<br/>
alone paid the interest on its cost.<br/>
<br/>
The next step was to assure to the company<br/>
a dependable supply of cheap ore. This Mr.<br/>
Frick did, after long negotiations and disputes<br/>
with Mr. Carnegie, by taking over from the<br/>
Oliver Mining Company five-sixths of its<br/>
interests in the remarkable open-pit mines <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the Mesabi fields on Lake Superior, and by a<br/>
fifty-year lease from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rockefellers </span>of other<br/>
Mesabi mines on a royalty basis with a<br/>
guaranteed annual output. The whole deal<br/>
guaranteed the steel company for fifty years a<br/>
minimum annual supply of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,200,000 </span>tons of<br/>
ore.<br/>
<br/>
A large proportion of this supply was secured<br/>
by Mr. Frick in such a manner that it cost the<br/>
company nothing but the inconvenience of<br/>
making a loan to the Oliver Mining Company.<br/>
The Rockefellers accepted a very low price for<br/>
their lease in exchange for the contract to<br/>
carry a share of the ore through the lakes on<br/>
a line of steamers that they owned.<br/>
<br/>
The last step was taken by Mr. Carnegie,<br/>
who arranged to make over and extend the old<br/>
Pittsburg, Shenango, and Lake Erie Railroad<br/>
to connect the works at Pittsburg with Conneaut, the harbor on Lake Erie<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'The'Carnegie<br/>
</span>Company also put on a line of steamers to<br/>
carry the excess ores over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rockefellers'<br/>
</span>contract.<br/>
<br/>
Now the organization of the steel business<br/>
was complete. The Carnegie Steel Company<br/>
owned everything it needed to manufacture<br/>
steel, from the unmined ore to the cars in which<br/>
it delivered its finished product, and it was<br/>
independent of any outsider in the transportation of any of its materials from the day the<br/>
ore was mined to the day its cars bearing its<br/>
finished product were delivered over its own<br/>
switches to the Pennsylvania Railroad or the<br/>
Baltimore & Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Frick now saw his future clear before<br/>
him. Mr. Carnegie counted his active career<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
