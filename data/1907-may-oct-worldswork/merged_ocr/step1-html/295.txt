<span>DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR<br/>
<br/>
vessel for $ 15. Upon his refusal to sign and<br/>
sail, his chest and clothes were taken away and<br/>
held on a pretended lien for board, and he was<br/>
thrown out on the streets to freeze or ship.<br/>
Ignorant of our language and laws, without<br/>
money or friends, and literally without a coat<br/>
to his back or shoes for his feet, someone<br/>
directed the shivering man to the Legal Aid<br/>
Society. Within an hour, the Society <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in arraigning the "crimp" before a<br/>
magistrate, forced him to disgorge all of the<br/>
man's property, and placed the sailor where he<br/>
could be safe from any further attacks of the<br/>
modern press-gang. The Harlem Branch in<br/>
New York has attorneys who can talk with<br/>
clients in Czech, French, Moravian, Magyar,<br/>
Slavonian, and Yiddish.<br/>
<br/>
A young boy in Philadelphia was left, on the<br/>
death of his parents, with a little sum from their<br/>
life insurance. A disbarred attorney and a<br/>
dive-keeper planned to gain possession of this<br/>
fund. When the attention of the Society was<br/>
called to the case, the boy was already with the<br/>
dive-keeper and a petition had been drafted<br/>
for the appointment of the latter as guardian<br/>
of his person and property. By the interposition<br/>
of the Society, the application was withdrawn;<br/>
the boy has been placed in a good home, and<br/>
his money deposited in trust for him until he<br/>
becomes of age.<br/>
<br/>
Another boy from the slums committed an<br/>
offence punishable by fine. Through perjured<br/>
testimony, he was indicted for a crime punishable by fifteen years' imprisonment. On the<br/>
day fixed for his trial, the Society was able to<br/>
lay the true facts before the district-attorney.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">graver </span>charge was dismissed, the boy<br/>
pleaded guilty of the lesser offence, was fined,<br/>
and then released so that he might earn the<br/>
amount of his fine.<br/>
<br/>
The Societies have been successful also in<br/>
getting new laws enacted to cover defects which<br/>
they have had occasion to observe. The<br/>
Legislature of New York, acting at the suggestion of the Legal Aid Society, recently passed<br/>
a law which provides that when wages are<br/>
assigned to a money-lender, a copy of the<br/>
assignment shall be filed with the employer<br/>
within three days. "This requirement has<br/>
served as a great check on the operations of<br/>
these usurious companies," said Mr. Cornelius<br/>
P. Kitchel, lately the chief attorney of the New<br/>
York Society, "Publicity is the very thing<br/>
which the employee desires to avoid. He<br/>
knows that it is apt to go hard with him if his<br/>
<br/>
9093<br/>
<br/>
employer discovers that he has assigned his<br/>
wages, and the requirement that knowledge of<br/>
the assignment be brought home to the employer<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">oefore </span>it can be valid has had a very salutary<br/>
effect. Our experience has shown us, however,<br/>
that the present law ought to be amended.<br/>
The loan companies have resorted to the<br/>
expedient of having the borrower sign a mere<br/>
power-of-attorney to someone else to assign<br/>
his wages, instead of actually assigning them<br/>
himself, and the situation thus arising should<br/>
be clearly covered by the law."<br/>
<br/>
The East-Side Branch in New York has<br/>
always been very deeply concerned with the<br/>
solution of the cases of abandonment and nonsupport of wives and children. The frequency<br/>
of this offence in the lower East Side of New<br/>
York is startling, but since it was impossible to<br/>
have the delinquent husband or father who had<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fled </span>from the state brought back for trial on<br/>
the charge of desertion and non-support, the<br/>
Society found itself practically helpless. After<br/>
much discussion, the law was amended. It is<br/>
now possible to have these offenders brought<br/>
back and held for the support of their families.<br/>
This is another instance in which the exertions<br/>
of the Society to improve the existing laws<br/>
have been most effectual.<br/>
<br/>
The most recent reform is that in regard to<br/>
prohibiting "the shanghaiing" of men to work<br/>
in the oyster fields in Chesapeake Bay. Men<br/>
are attracted by false statements or actually<br/>
kidnapped by oyster boatmen and forced to<br/>
work on the boats under conditions of virtual<br/>
slavery. How terrible these conditions were<br/>
was shown in the evidence brought out by<br/>
United States District-Attorney Rose, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balti</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>more, at the time of the investigation made by<br/>
the Legal Aid Societies of New York and Philadelphia. It was then shown that "shanghaiing" was going on unchecked on the oyster<br/>
boats of Chesapeake Bay, and that men unused<br/>
to seafaring lives were forced to remain night<br/>
and day for months on the open oyster boats,<br/>
without sufficient food and clothing and without<br/>
wages. The boats never put into shore, the<br/>
supplies being delivered and the oysters taken<br/>
away by tugs, and it was only after a raid by a<br/>
United States Revenue cutter that the full<br/>
state of affairs was revealed. Mr. Rose<br/>
stated that in the seven years in which he had<br/>
tried these cases he had never met with one<br/>
man who had ever been paid a day's wages, no<br/>
matter how long he had worked. Largely<br/>
owing to the energy of Legal Aid attorneys, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
