<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PENNSYLVANIA</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>PALACE <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">GRAFT<br/>
<br/>
</span>feet high, four feet wide and eight feet long<br/>
measured eighty feet. The per-foot rule was<br/>
the solid contents of a box which would just<br/>
hold the article of furniture. And everything<br/>
was $ 18.40 a foot. Under the per-pound rule,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanderson</span>'s bill to the state for chandeliers<br/>
and such <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronze </span>was $ 2,049,522.96. A leading<br/>
bronze dealer <span style="color: #0000FF;">testified </span>that he would have been<br/>
glad to get the job for $ 800,000. A fair charge<br/>
would have been $ 500,000. Sanderson, contractor, paid Sanderson, the Bronze Company,<br/>
$ 550,000 for the capitol <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronze</span>, and the company made its own profit. Under the per-foot<br/>
rule, the Pennsylvania Construction Company,<br/>
of which Congressman H. Burd Cassel is the<br/>
head, drew over $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">2,000,000 </span>for metal filing<br/>
cases without any legal contract at all, so far<br/>
as can be learned.<br/>
<br/>
Even contracts with a friend to interpret<br/>
them were not convenient enough, it seems.<br/>
Baccarat glass, from France, was called for;<br/>
but Pittsburg glass from Beaver County was<br/>
substituted throughout, with no effect on the<br/>
price. There was an utter disregard of values<br/>
when it came to making out bills.<br/>
<br/>
THE ELECTION OF A NEW TREASURER<br/>
<br/>
But William H. Berry was elected State<br/>
Treasurer in November, 1905, and immediately<br/>
there was a change in the progress of the work.<br/>
A $ 3,000,000 scheme to enlarge and beautify<br/>
the capitol grounds was dropped outright. In<br/>
the six months that followed, the retiring<br/>
Treasurer paid bills amounting to $ <span style="color: #ff0000;">3,887</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">522.88</span>.<br/>
When <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r. </span>Berry took charge of the treasury, on<br/>
May <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist</span>, furnishings shown by these bills were<br/>
all <span style="color: #0000FF;">receipted </span>for as delivered and the bills<br/>
approved; room after room was filled with<br/>
goods; but delivery could not be made fast<br/>
enough to answer the contractor's needs, so<br/>
he had just sent the bills. Goods kept coming<br/>
in for months afterward. Some never came<br/>
at all; at least, they have not been found.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that aroused the public was<br/>
the unpacking of the great bronze doors costing<br/>
$ 65,000. It revealed a double row of heads<br/>
on each, which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">veriest </span>tyro in politics could<br/>
recognize as portraits of some of the most active<br/>
men under the contracts and men who made<br/>
politics a business; many of them had come<br/>
under condemnation because of their methods<br/>
in securing votes and shaping events. Huston<br/>
explained that they were not portraits, but<br/>
merely types; but when the doors had been<br/>
photographed and the photographs published<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9241<br/>
<br/>
</span>in the newspapers, there were few so dull that<br/>
they could not see that Huston's "types" were<br/>
all of one <span style="color: #0000FF;">type-the </span>men who had to do with<br/>
the new capitol.<br/>
<br/>
Then came the fall campaign and, to help<br/>
the ticket along, Governor Pennypacker began<br/>
telling what a magnificent capitol the state had,<br/>
and how it was built within the appropriation.<br/>
He made no reference to the furnishings; but<br/>
the people took his words in their obvious interpretation, and praise of the new capitol and<br/>
faithfulness of the commission to its duty were<br/>
sung all across the state. Then Treasurer<br/>
Berry remarked that there was a huge mass<br/>
of graft concealed about the premises somewhere, and that in his judgment it cost nearer<br/>
$ 13,000,000 than $ 4,000,000. Then the trouble<br/>
began. The Governor asserted that the state<br/>
had the worth of its money, and arranged with<br/>
the railroads to run cheap excursions to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harris</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">burg</span>, that all the people might see for <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>that he was right. Berry, on the other<br/>
hand, kept pegging away at the books, finding<br/>
out what he could for himself and making it<br/>
public, and getting no real assistance either<br/>
from the other members of the Grounds and<br/>
Buildings Commission, the Governor, or the<br/>
Auditor-General. His revelations were so astounding that to the mass of the people they<br/>
seemed merely campaign lies. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berry</span>'s eyes<br/>
had been first opened when ten men in ten<br/>
days laid $ 90,000 worth of parquetry flooring,<br/>
and he was asked to approve the bill therefor.<br/>
<br/>
SOME OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">SANDERsoN</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>BILLS<br/>
<br/>
According to the specifications, chandeliers<br/>
and standards and bronze work were to be<br/>
made of a composition of 87% copper and 12%<br/>
tin. Artisans employed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>The Pennsylvania<br/>
Bronze Company," which was Sanderson under<br/>
an alias, testified that the composition was in<br/>
fact 90% copper, 3% tin, and 7% spelter.<br/>
This is bad enough; but a firm of iron founders<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">testified </span>that they sold this Sanderson company<br/>
3,000 pounds of iron castings, such as are<br/>
commonly used to weight the bases of lamp<br/>
and standard supports, at four cents a pound.<br/>
And lastly the chandeliers have been found to<br/>
be short in weight, in one case 300 pounds<br/>
short. The total bill was $ 2,049,522.96. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanderson </span>(the Pennsylvania Bronze Co.) sold this<br/>
stuff to Sanderson (the contractor) for<br/>
$ <span style="color: #0000FF;">605,851.23</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the Treasurer's private <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>, the ceiling<br/>
decoration <span style="color: #0000FF;">cost </span>Sanderson $ 300 but <span style="color: #0000FF;">cost </span>the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
