</span>cities and adding to the horrors of congestion<br/>
which have already become so commonplace as to fail to make much impression upon<br/>
the more calloused of us. However sound the<br/>
arguments recently advanced by Professor<br/>
Willcox, of the Census Bureau, to the effect<br/>
that the herding of aliens in places like New<br/>
York and Boston is kept up only by new arrivals,<br/>
while the earlier comers gradually fuse with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s population at large, the fact<br/>
obviously remains that there is congestion and<br/>
that it does not automatically relieve itself<br/>
in any such degree as is desirable. Statistics as<br/>
yet give no evidence of an appreciable change<br/>
in the forces and conditions which have always<br/>
drawn our immigrant classes to the larger<br/>
cities and operated to keep them there.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the cold facts, set forth graphically<br/>
in an <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanying </span>chart, for the past year.<br/>
Of the 1,100,735 aliens admitted, 374,708,<br/>
or over <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third</span>, claimed the state of New<br/>
York as their ultimate destination; <span style="color: #0000FF;">198,681</span>,<br/>
or more than one-sixth, claimed Pennsylvania;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
86,539, or about one-twelfth, claimed Illinois;<br/>
and 73,863, or about one-sixteenth, claimed<br/>
Massachusetts. A very large majority-how<br/>
large no one can say-of these people took up<br/>
their permanent residence in the four cities<br/>
of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and<br/>
Boston, or in the suburbs of these great population centres. It is estimated that at least<br/>
seven-tenths of all immigrants admitted settle<br/>
in those portions of the country which are<br/>
already most densely inhabited. The movement to deflect a considerable proportion of the<br/>
newcomers to the South and other sections of<br/>
the United States where white labor is in urgent<br/>
demand is interesting and not altogether <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpromising</span>. Yet, granting it a large measure<br/>
of success, if the present enormous rate of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influx </span>is to be maintained, or indeed still<br/>
further augmented, it is difficult to see how the<br/>
cities and states of the North Atlantic coast,<br/>
so long the unrivaled haven of the homeseeking and labor-hunting foreigner, will be<br/>
able to detect the difference.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">HE </span>last topic on which America is<br/>
looking for instruction is democracy<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>On that point we hold ourselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">prepared </span>to enlighten the world. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yet </span>no one can<br/>
be long in Scandinavia without feeling that if<br/>
we ever thoroughly learned it, we are forgetting<br/>
the very first lesson in equality. Try it and<br/>
see. See if you do not catch your breath the<br/>
first timea shabby, <span style="color: #0000FF;">humble-minded </span>Norwegian<br/>
cab-driver shakes you warmly by the hand when<br/>
you give him his fee. Theoretically, Americans are prepared to shake hands on equal<br/>
terms with the whole world, but in practice<br/>
there is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eondeseension </span>in the handshake we<br/>
offer to the man with the hoe. In America,<br/>
where the little stage-play of equality is understood on both sides, we are unconscious of its<br/>
absurdity. But when you find yourself patronizing a Scandinavian-that touchstone of<br/>
sincerity-you fall suddenly ashamed. The<br/>
<br/>
experience is tonic. The longer you stay on<br/>
the northern peninsula, the more you come to<br/>
feel that every one of the good things you<br/>
would like to see copied at home is based upon<br/>
that very creed which we are forever proclaiming to the whole civilized world. Therefore, the first lesson you wish impressed upon<br/>
your own people is this<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>More honesty in<br/>
our democracy.<br/>
<br/>
Because they really believe in equality as an<br/>
ideal worth struggling toward, the people of<br/>
Scandinavia have developed a quick and growing sense of social responsibility. Things we<br/>
here call privileges there pass as rights. They<br/>
are not afraid of names; "paternalism" and<br/>
"socialism" do not scare them. Everybody's<br/>
rights-the rights of women as well as of men,<br/>
of farmers as well as urbanites, of the poor as<br/>
well as the rich, get recognition. Much that<br/>
in America goes under the name of philanthropy<br/>
