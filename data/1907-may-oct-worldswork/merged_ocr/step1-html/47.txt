</span>Much startled, he looked first in one direction,<br/>
then in another. He then decided to start<br/>
an investigation; he dropped <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>on all-fours<br/>
and began to follow the wire to the switch, but<br/>
he finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">changed </span>his mind and went off in<br/>
the opposite direction, following the cord to<br/>
the little stake at the foot of which the spool<br/>

and followed my tracks down to where I had<br/>
taken the bark off the trees. Here he <span style="color: #0000FF;">nosed<br/>
</span>about for some <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span>, and finally took a turn<br/>

During the previous winter, Mr. Wright<br/>
made some pictures of Rocky Mountain sheep<br/>
on the Gardner River, in Montana. The deep<br/>
snows <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the higher mountains and the intense<br/>
cold-it was between 12° and 20° below <span style="color: #ff0000;">zerodrove </span>the animals down to the lower hills.<br/>
<br/>
"I found," he said, "a place where the sheep<br/>
came to <span style="color: #0000FF;">spend </span>a part of the day and I set up<br/>
my tripod near the point of a little ridge on the<br/>
opposite side of the gulch, two or three hundred yards away from them. After the camera<br/>
was in place and focused, I went back of the<br/>

around the point every few minutes to see if<br/>
