<br/>
front of them is the famous "woolsack," the<br/>
seat of the Lord Chancellor, which is in reality<br/>
a large square ottoman covered with a dark-red<br/>
material and furnished with a projection<br/>
against which the Chancellor leans his back.<br/>
To his right and left the rows of benches face<br/>
one another down the chamber. Those to the<br/>
right are occupied by the Bishops and the<br/>
supporters of the Government of the day, who<br/>
just now are not a numerous body. The<br/>
Opposition sit on the left. The Bishops,<br/>
particularly the Archbishop of Canterbury,<br/>
are fairly regular attendants and their contributions to debate are often of great value.<br/>
The visitor, depressed at seeing but one<br/>
Liberal peer <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>every five square-yards of the<br/>
ministerial side of the House, will find more<br/>
interesting matter among the Conservative<br/>
Opposition. Sitting here as regular attendants of the House are men who have given<br/>
distinguished service to the state in politics,<br/>
war, and commerce. There is the Marquis of<br/>
Lansdowne, the most successful of recent<br/>
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs. There<br/>
is Lord Cawdor, who in Conservative days<br/>
gave up the chairmanship of the Great Western<br/>
Railway, held by him for years with eminent<br/>
success, to become First Lord of the Admiralty.<br/>
There is Lord Roberts, the central figure of the<br/>
South African war; and Lord Milner, the victor<br/>
of the even <span style="color: #ff0000;">fercer </span>struggle of South African<br/>
politics. There is Lord Rosebery, formerly<br/>
Prime Minister of England, who has the most<br/>
brilliant political mind in the country and is,<br/>
though a Liberal, generally opposed to the<br/>
present <span style="color: #0000FF;">Government</span>. There are men who have<br/>
ruled India, men who have governed colonies,<br/>
men who in diplomacy and war and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance<br/>
</span>have received the best training in affairs that<br/>
the English state can give. A distinguished<br/>
career as a Minister of the Crown ends commonly in the House of Lords. Here, disguised<br/>
as Lord St. Aldwyn, sits Sir Michael <span style="color: #ff0000;">HicksBeach</span>, who for eight years had control of the<br/>
national finances; and the Duke of Devonshire,<br/>
behind whom are more than twenty years of the<br/>
highest official life. What is in theory a numerous hereditary chamber is in fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chamber<br/>
of limited numbers consisting of those peers<br/>
who take a serious interest in politics or have<br/>
been lately elevated from the House of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commons </span>for political reasons<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And ranging, as<br/>
the choice does, over six hundred and odd of<br/>
those on whom the advantages of wealth and<br/>
education and influence have been most <span style="color: #0000FF;">lavishly<br/>
<br/>
</span>9483<br/>
<br/>
bestowed, the comparative excellence of the<br/>
working fraction of the Lords need cause no<br/>
surprise. Their worst enemies do not aver that<br/>
they are other than businesslike, dignified, and<br/>
economical of time. Their <span style="color: #0000FF;">oratorical </span>average<br/>
is wonderfully little inferior to that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commons</span>; and so it would remain even without Lord<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosebery</span>, the most polished orator in the land.<br/>
<br/>
IS IT A GOOD UPPER HOUSE?<br/>
<br/>
In normal times, however, the question is<br/>
whether the Lords as an institution are worthy<br/>
of praise or condemnation. The value of a<br/>
second chamber in countries with representative government is not to be argued here. The<br/>
need of it will be assumed, and everyone will<br/>
agree that if ordinary constitutional states find<br/>
a second chamber advisable, in England where<br/>
Parliament is omnipotent from day to day and<br/>
never such a thing has been heard of as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">judicial<br/>
</span>pronouncement on the validity of Parliamentary<br/>
acts, the need is more imperative than elsewhere. The Parliament of England, it must<br/>
be remembered, is vastly more powerful than<br/>
any other legislature except the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span>. Not<br/>
only is it legally omnipotent, but the Ministers<br/>
of the Crown are members of it-generally of<br/>
the House of Commons-and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hostile vote of<br/>
that House can any day force Ministers to<br/>
choose between resigning in a body and running<br/>
the great risk of advising the King to dissolve<br/>
Parliament, in order that the people may pass<br/>
upon their case in a general election. Thus the<br/>
Administration is not in a position to control<br/>
the House of Commons, either by vetoing legislation or by making it ineffectual through unsympathetic execution. It is, by the nature of<br/>
the case, in close alliance with the majority<br/>
which supports it in the House. It is practically a committee of that majority. Its wide<br/>
powers, both in the purely executive sphere and<br/>
in the initiation of legislation and the management <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Parliamentary time and business, are<br/>
in fact derived from the good-will of this majority, whose desertion might bring it to ruin at<br/>
any moment. As a matter of practice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, the majority never desert. In face of a<br/>
common foe, the majority and the Administration cling together like a happily wedded couple<br/>
and therefore wield, in the whole household of<br/>
state, an almost despotic power. As a check on<br/>
this despotism, there is as great a need for a<br/>
second chamber as could well be imagined.<br/>
<br/>
But is the House of Lords a good second<br/>
chamber or a bad one? Now a question like<br/>
<br/>
