<span>THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL<br/>
<br/>
No words could better express the full meaning of the awakening in literature.<br/>
<br/>
For the comprehension of the more important phases of contemporary life in the South,<br/>
one must go elsewhere than to the writing of<br/>
which we have been speaking. "Of careful<br/>
analysis of social conditions, of profound study<br/>
and comprehension of the principles of human<br/>
nature and human action, and of serene, <span style="color: #ff0000;">selfcontained </span>art, there are still few traces in the<br/>
Southern literature of the present generation."<br/>
<br/>
This deficiency has been, in part, supplied<br/>
by such books as Mr. Edgar Gardner Murphy's "The Present South" and Mr. Holland<br/>
Thompson's "From the Cotton Field to the<br/>
Cotton Mill."<br/>
<br/>
Necessarily, there has been much writing on<br/>
the Negro problem. With the lurid and melodramatic novels and plays of Thomas Dixon<br/>
before us; with the temperate discussions in<br/>
Thomas Nelson Page's "The Negro: the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Southerner</span>'s Problem" and Prof. W. B.<br/>
Smith's "The Color Line"; with the widely<br/>
divergent addresses and articles by such<br/>
leaders as Senator Tillman, Bishop Galloway,<br/>
and Chancellor Hill--we have every element<br/>
that enters into a most complex situation.<br/>
Furthermore, in Dubois's "Souls of the Black<br/>
Folk" and Booker Washington's "Up from<br/>
Slavery" and "The Future of the American<br/>
Negro," the race has not been without its<br/>
own interpreters.<br/>
<br/>
THE SPIRIT OF LITERARY INDEPENDENCE<br/>
<br/>
The critical point of view has been applied<br/>
not only to the study and writing of history and<br/>
literature but to all other phases of Southern<br/>
life. The right and the duty of criticism have<br/>
been firmly established. The critic has had<br/>
to contend against emotionalism and a spirit<br/>
of futile obstruction. He may have at times<br/>
been unduly rasping and unsympathetic, but<br/>
he has in the face of all obstacles maintained<br/>
the right to see facts as they are, to judge the<br/>
South in the light of the best that has been and<br/>
is being <span style="color: #0000FF;">thought </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>done in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">uphold<br/>
</span>standards of excellence. He has had to resist<br/>
the conservative and the sentimentalist. Some<br/>
men have, ever since the war, failed to understand the meaning of defeat. They have<br/>
magnified the life before the war as "the most<br/>
glorious in the history of the world." They<br/>
have been unwilling to see any defects in the<br/>
South and consequently have resented criticism<br/>
either by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Northerners </span>or by the people of their<br/>
<br/>

own section. They have failed, as Lanier<br/>
said, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>to perceive the deeper movements <span style="color: #0000FF;">under<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">running </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">times</span>." They have been willing<br/>
to have the South remain proud in its isolation.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>have <span style="color: #0000FF;">harked </span>back to the bitter memories<br/>
of the past. In a word, they have forgot nothing<br/>
and learned nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The conflict between these two types of men<br/>
has waged furiously since the close of the war.<br/>
The contrast may be seen in the fiery speeches<br/>
of the unreconstructed Toombs and the statesmanlike address of Ben Hill <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Tammany<br/>
Hall in 1866.<br/>
<br/>
No severer rebuke has ever been given to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sectionalism </span>than Lamar's <span style="color: #0000FF;">speech </span>on Charles<br/>
Sumner and no more genuine plea was ever<br/>
made for nationalism than Henry Grady's on<br/>
"The New South." Dr. J. L. M. Curry <span style="color: #ff0000;">overthrew </span>the contentions of many a moss-back<br/>
when he said before the Georgia Legislature:<br/>
<br/>
"I am not afraid of the educated masses; I would rather<br/>
trust the masses than kings, priests, aristocracy, or established church. No <span style="color: #0000FF;">nation </span>can realize its full <span style="color: #0000FF;">possibility<br/>
</span>unless it builds upon the education of the whole people.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>When Major Robert Bingham said, "The<br/>
greatest blessing that ever befell us was a failure<br/>
to establish a nationality, and the next greatest<br/>
blessing was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">getting </span>rid of slavery on any<br/>
conditions," he answered effectively a certain<br/>
type of Confederate memorial address.<br/>
<br/>
After all, is it not true that "educators are<br/>
needed more than capitalists; school houses<br/>
more than factories: a change in educational<br/>
methods more than a change in politics"?<br/>
Slowly, out of investigations and reports, articles<br/>
and addresses, and even books, there is evolving<br/>
a well-defined educational programme or policy.<br/>
First, there is a desire to know and to state<br/>
facts. In the Governor's <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>at Raleigh,<br/>
N. C., several years ago, some educational<br/>
leaders were formulating a platform for an<br/>
educational campaign. The question arose<br/>
whether the actual facts with regard to<br/>
illiteracy in the state should be incorporated<br/>
in the statement. Governor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aycock </span>said<br/>
impressively: "If it is a fact, then let it be<br/>
stated in unmistakable terms." Now that is<br/>
the spirit of the present South. The old <span style="color: #0000FF;">sensitiveness </span>with regard to the opinion of others<br/>
has yielded to the grave facing of facts. "Men<br/>
recognize that the greater reproach is not<br/>
illiteracy, but indifference to it. They perceive that its significance cannot be offset by<br/>
dwelling upon the admitted and often darker<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
