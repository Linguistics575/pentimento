</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">GOVERNOR<br/>
<br/>
</span>but without any visible effort. His desk was<br/>
piled high with works of fiction, for his curious<br/>
and restless mind was reaching out into sympathetic relations with all sorts and conditions<br/>
of men. To-day his library is crowded with<br/>
the writings of Darwin, Tyndall, Spencer,<br/>
and Huxley, and the novels have gone by the<br/>
board. Both the fiction and the science he<br/>
devoured for the same reason-his desire to<br/>
understand and interpret the dominant <span style="color: #0000FF;">im</span>,<br/>
pulses and achievements of his own age.<br/>
<br/>
From college he passed into a year or two<br/>
of teaching, then into the law school, then into<br/>
a law office. A few years later came the professor's chair at Cornell, where he gained a<br/>
singular and memorable hold on the students<br/>
in the law school; and from teaching he returned to his practice in New York. From<br/>
the first day in the law school to the time of his<br/>
election as Governor, he has lived a life of<br/>
unremitting toil and steady climbing. There<br/>
has been no happy chance in his career. Circumstances have usually been against <span style="color: #0000FF;">him-sometimes </span>cruelly so. Again and again he<br/>
would have broken down through over-strain,<br/>
were it not for the long summers in Switzerland, spent in tramping unfrequented roads<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">climbing </span>famous peaks. It is amusing to<br/>
hear men talk of "the remarkable opportunity<br/>
that came to Mr. Hughes," in the gas and the<br/>
insurance investigations. It may well be<br/>
doubted whether any other man in the country<br/>
would have proved so clearly adequate to the<br/>
opportunity which those investigations developed. And he was adequate, not because<br/>
he was born so, but because behind every<br/>
probing inquiry addressed to reluctant witnesses<br/>
lay twenty-five years of self-discipline, concentrated toil, and mastery of problems <span style="color: #0000FF;">touching </span>every field of human endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
As Governor of New York, Mr. Hughes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stands </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>a distinct and vivid figure in the<br/>
national consciousness. There is no mystery<br/>
about him, no luck at the foundation of his<br/>
success, no halo around his head; but there<br/>
are certain very <span style="color: #0000FF;">definite </span>qualities in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">personality</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The most obvious of these is his analytic<br/>
power and habit. To hear him speak is to<br/>
see a splendid exhibition of intellect in action.<br/>
It is like watching the play of a powerful and<br/>
noiseless engine, with all the parts in perfect<br/>
working order. He thinks upon his feet. He<br/>
has no inclination for rhetorical devices, he<br/>
cuts out introduction and peroration and<br/>

ornament, and goes straight to the heart of the<br/>
fact. He speaks with great <span style="color: #0000FF;">deliberation</span>, but<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">since </span>his political campaign-with great<br/>
physical energy. The dominant impression<br/>
is one of lucidity, common sense, and unswerving conviction. He tears off the husk<br/>
and speedily reaches the kernel. He pours<br/>
over every subject the light of intelligence.<br/>
He has rare power of calm, logical exposition.<br/>
His mind naturally seeks for principles behind<br/>
phenomena, for causes behind effects. Whatever subject he is expounding, he must analyze<br/>
it to the core. Only when he has reached a<br/>
central point of view is he willing to talk at all.<br/>
<br/>
HIS RARE SELF-CONTROL<br/>
<br/>
This life-long habit of analysis has given<br/>
him a rare self-control and equanimity in the<br/>
presence of novel and unexpected developments.<br/>
The word which most nearly describes him is<br/>
"well-poised." In speaking, all his sentences<br/>
are the unfolding of one thesis; in action,<br/>
all his deeds are part of one deliberately chosen<br/>
policy. Both President Roosevelt and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Governor </span>Hughes have been misjudged, and for<br/>
similar reasons. Because Mr. Roosevelt is<br/>
swift in physical action, he has been called<br/>
"impulsive"; and because Mr. Hughes is<br/>
deliberate and dignified in physical movement,<br/>
he has been pronounced "academic." The<br/>
President's long deliberation over his policies<br/>
is gradually being recognized by the nation;<br/>
and when the people understand Mr. Hughes,<br/>
they will recognize in him one of the swiftest<br/>
minds and most intense natures now in public<br/>
life. But his long legal training and natural<br/>
poise make it impossible to catch him off his<br/>
guard. He may be mistaken or wrong; but<br/>
he will never leap before he looks. He is not<br/>
to be cajoled or misled by sophistry or chicanery.<br/>
He is under no illusion as to fame or power.<br/>
He understands his position and possibilities<br/>
better than any one else understands them.<br/>
There is no desire to conceal realities from<br/>
himself or from the public. He views all<br/>
problems in the clear and steady light of truth.<br/>
<br/>
This native impartiality and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fairmindedness<br/>
</span>give him necessarily great breadth of intellectual and moral sympathy. His calendar<br/>
of public engagements for six weeks shows him<br/>
attending every sort of function, from the<br/>
Purim ball to the dedication of a new building<br/>
at Cornell University. The study of law is<br/>
his first concern, and always will be. But in<br/>
education he has been profoundly interested,<br/>
