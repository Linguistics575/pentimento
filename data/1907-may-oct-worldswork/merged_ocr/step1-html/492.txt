<br/>
THE RESULTS OF NINE YEARS OF AMERICAN OCCUPATION<br/>

<br/>
HE results of ten years are not an<br/>
<br/>
I adequate test of the genius of a nation<br/>
<br/>
new to the task of colonization-and<br/>
it has been less than ten years since a small<br/>
body of bluejackets and soldiers struggled<br/>
through the breakers at Guanica, planted the<br/>
American flag, and gave the small <span style="color: #ff0000;">Puertoriqueho </span>the first genuine thrill of his humdrum<br/>
life. The tourist who comes to San Juan by<br/>
way of Havana and who loiters about the plazas<br/>
or rides down the military road to Ponce may<br/>
perhaps feel that we have wrought few mighty<br/>
works. But when one comes who first saw<br/>
Porto Rico from the topmast of an army transport, he finds new wonders at every step arid<br/>
is unhappy until he <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>patient friend to<br/>
whom he may tell the story of how different<br/>
it was then.<br/>
<br/>
To appreciate what has beep done, it is<br/>
necessary to understand that the Porto Rico<br/>
of 1898 was essentially a part of Europe; the<br/>
United States and all that it represents was as<br/>
utterly foreign to the average native as <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>Arabia or Hindustan.<br/>
<br/>
"Where is Turkey?" asked an American<br/>
of a class of girls in the superior school at<br/>
Mayaguez.<br/>
<br/>
"In Asia," came the answer in chorus.<br/>
<br/>
"What is its capital?"<br/>
<br/>
"Constantinople," answered the chorus.<br/>
<br/>
"Where is the United <span style="color: #0000FF;">States </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N'<br/>
<br/>
</span>There was a profound silence.<br/>
<br/>
"The study of the United States belongs<br/>
to a course which has not been taken yet!" the<br/>
teacher hastened to explain.<br/>
<br/>
This was in January, 1899. The course is<br/>
being taken now and everybody knows the<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
THE AMERICAN SCHOOL-TEACHER AT WORK<br/>
<br/>
The critic who speaks lightly of the first<br/>
colonial experiments of the United States<br/>
is asked to ponder the story of the American<br/>
school-teacher in Porto Rico. Nine years ago,<br/>
when our flag went up, there were <span style="color: #0000FF;">660,000<br/>
</span>people upward of ten years of age, not one in<br/>
five <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>whom could read and write. his own<br/>
language. After four hundred years of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Spanish<br/>
