<span>THE CONQUEST OF THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">TROPICS<br/>
<br/>
</span>A LONG STEP IN EDUCATIONAL WORK<br/>
<br/>
EW things are as conservative <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>educational institutions and methods. To<br/>
make a serious change in them is a prodigious<br/>
task. It is like changing the course of a river'<br/>
you must both dam and dig. The very shape<br/>
of the world is against you, and the habit of<br/>
ages. So much the more noteworthy, therefore, are the radical changes that President<br/>
Woodrow Wilson is making in the life of<br/>
Princeton. This change has never been better<br/>
told than in a recent report made by a committee of he Board of Trustees:<br/>
<br/>
"We have witnessed in the last few years the creation<br/>
of a new Princeton.. Princeton, so far as her under<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>graduates were concerned, had come to be merely a delightful place of residence, where young men, for the most part<br/>
happily occupied with other things, were made to perform<br/>
certain academic tasks.. For a great majority of<br/>
them residence here meant a happy life of comradeship<br/>
and sport interrupted by the grind of perfunctory'lessons'<br/>
and examinations, to which they attended rather because<br/>
of the fear of being cut from off me <span style="color: #ff0000;">life </span>than because they<br/>
were seriously engaged in getting the training which would<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">faculties </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">spirits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>tasks of the world.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>That is a familiar picture. Then follows an<br/>
explanation of the change that the tutorial<br/>
system has wrought in two years:<br/>
<br/>
"By it, we meant to say that the intellectual life of a<br/>
college did not consist of attendance upon class exercises<br/>
or of preparation for <span style="color: #ff0000;">tecitations</span>, but consisted rather of<br/>
constant contact with study and the intimate association<br/>
of teacher and pupil outside the classroom, where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tradition </span>of lectures and <span style="color: #0000FF;">recitation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>was forgotten, or rejected,<br/>
and a thoroughly natural and human relationship, the<br/>
relationship of fellow students, substituted. And that<br/>
meaning has at once been made evident to the whole<br/>
country. The contrast to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>order of things is most<br/>
marked in the case of the intercourse <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>undergraduates<br/>
with those preceptors who invite them often to their houses<br/>
or who live in the same dormitories with them. A natural<br/>
and easy social relationship, an informal, frequent exchange<br/>
of calls, the easy, unconstrained talks of ordinary comrade<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>ship, make study itself seem a thing natural and human."<br/>
<br/>
This system seems to warrant the judgment<br/>
that has been passed on it-that it is the most<br/>
important change that has been made in college<br/>
work or method within recent times. To the<br/>
lay mind it so commends itself.<br/>
<br/>
THE CONQUEST OF THE TROPICS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OLONEL </span>WILLIAM C. GORGAS, of<br/>
the United States Army, is a physician<br/>
<br/>
and sanitary <span style="color: #ff0000;">engireer </span>of high standing. It<br/>
was he who <span style="color: #ff0000;">practsauy </span>exterminated yellow<br/>
fever in Havana and has more recently made<br/>
<br/>
9171<br/>
<br/>
the Panama Canal Zone a healthful place to<br/>
live and to work in. Any conclusion, therefore,<br/>
reached by Colonel Gorgas about health and<br/>
work in the tropics is entitled to very serious<br/>
consideration. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span>wonder then that his recent<br/>
address at Cornell University has attracted<br/>
world-wide attention. In the course of it, he<br/>
said:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">think </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanitation </span>can now show that any population<br/>
coming into the tropics can protect itself against disease<br/>
by measures that are both simple and inexpensive; that<br/>
life in the tropics for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Anglo-Saxon will be more healthful<br/>
than in the temperate zones; and that gradually within the<br/>
next two or three centuries tropical countries, which offer<br/>
a much greater return for man's labor than the temperate<br/>
zones, will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>settled by the white races, and that again<br/>
the centres of wealth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilization </span>and population will be<br/>
in the tropics, as they were in the dawn of man's history,<br/>
rather than in the temperate zones as at present.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>If this turn out to be true, no more important<br/>
fact has been discovered for many a year, for<br/>
it means that a richer economic development<br/>
awaits us than men have hitherto seriously<br/>
thought of. If by sanitation, the black and<br/>
brown races of the tropics can themselves<br/>
be made economically <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficient</span>, they will reach<br/>
a commanding rank in civilization. Or, if<br/>
they remain relatively inefficient and the white<br/>
race can live and work in the tropics and<br/>
retain much of its energy, by economic pressure<br/>
and by the pressure of population it will in<br/>
time absorb or displace the brown and black<br/>
races. In either case an economic conquest of<br/>
the tropics will be made. In the early stages<br/>
of tropical conquest by the white race-if this<br/>
be the way it is to <span style="color: #ff0000;">come-Icy </span>will economically subjugate the others by becoming their<br/>
leaders.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever be the effect on the races, the<br/>
sanitary cleaning up of the tropics, if Colonel<br/>
Gorgas's prediction be true, will in time bring<br/>
a new economic era in the world. If these<br/>
rich regions can be made integral parts of the<br/>
organized productive world, the sustaining<br/>
of life in healthful comfort will require a<br/>
minimum of labor; and it ought to come about<br/>
that a large part of energetic <span style="color: #0000FF;">mankind-men<br/>
</span>that are capable of higher work-will have<br/>
the unenervating leisure that has been the<br/>
dream of the builders of Utopias.<br/>
<br/>
This is not yet a scientific demonstration,<br/>
but it is a fascinating prediction by a scientific<br/>
man worthy of attention, and it is fine stuff to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">make </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dreams </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span>.<br/>
<br/>
But this much we are demonstrating year<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
