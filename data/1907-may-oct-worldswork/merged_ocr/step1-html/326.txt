</span>unnecessary. To give such advice demands no<br/>
lesser degree of skill, training, and natural<br/>
acumen than does the most difficult surgical<br/>
operation. Still, a man will gladly pay $ 500<br/>
to be operated on successfully for appendicitis,<br/>
when he would grumble mightily at paying<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">50 </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>two hours' discussion with a man<br/>
equally trained, who will advise him with<br/>
reference to his personal health and habits.<br/>
It is the dramatic service of the physician<br/>
which at the present time commands public<br/>
admiration-that service which is given in<br/>
extreme and critical cases, where the physician<br/>
is called in to aid Nature to stem the current<br/>
of forces making for death and to emphasize<br/>
those making for life.<br/>
<br/>
I am dwelling on this point because it is<br/>
basal. I am sure there are many persons in the<br/>
community who will secure the services and<br/>
physicians as I have mentioned, but they<br/>
cannot expect the highest grade of service without giving that which corresponds to the fee<br/>
paid for other lines of medical service.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT THE DOCTOR REALLY DOES<br/>
<br/>
The doctor no more cures the disease than<br/>
the engineer pulls the train. The doctor is<br/>
far less important than is the engineer. A<br/>
better illustration is that of the pilot on a steamboat. Knowing where the vessel is to go, the<br/>
pilot can guide it to that port by the shortest,<br/>
safest route. If it is necessary to take a channel where there are rocks, he will know what<br/>
the chances are and how to take these chances<br/>
to the best advantage. If the vessel strikes<br/>
a rock, he will know about the tides, the probable winds, available help, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
All this the doctor can do. In a case of<br/>
typhoid fever, where the danger is that the<br/>
temperature may become so high as to interfere with vital operations, he can by means of<br/>
cold baths or other treatment reduce the temperature, thus permitting Nature to do her own<br/>
work more favorably. In the case of a broken<br/>
bone, he can see that the two ends are against<br/>
each other and that the bone is straight; then<br/>
Nature will do the rest. So one might discuss<br/>
disorders of vision, with all their reflex <span style="color: #0000FF;">effects-disorders </span>of digestion, and the conduct of the<br/>
person under various conditions of disease.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor can guide, although he does not<br/>
cure. I would myself no more think of going<br/>
without the constant counsel of some other<br/>
physician-although this is my <span style="color: #0000FF;">specialty-than </span>I would attempt to form a corporation<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TO </span>USE A DOCTOR<br/>
<br/>
involving questions of law without the advice<br/>
of a lawyer, or sail my little yacht into a strange<br/>
port without a pilot.<br/>
<br/>
The chief service of the physician is to the<br/>
man that is well; and it consists not in curing<br/>
him when sick, but in keeping him well.<br/>
<br/>
THE COMING SANITARIUM<br/>
<br/>
A new type of sanitarium is surely coming.<br/>
The old sanitarium or hospital-and, indeed,<br/>
the present one-has for its main object the<br/>
cure of disease. This is good, and there must<br/>
always be such hospitals and sanitariums.<br/>
But the great thing is not to cure, but to teach<br/>
people higher habits of living.<br/>
<br/>
It is not so fine a thing as at first glance it<br/>
appears to take a broken-down man or woman<br/>
and restore the patient to health. He goes<br/>
back under the same old conditions, and, as<br/>
shown by cases on record, it is probable that he<br/>
will break down again. The really great<br/>
thing to do is to take these people and not<br/>
merely restore them to conditions of health and<br/>
efficiency, but so to reconstruct their daily<br/>
lives and habits that thereafter they will live<br/>
normally.<br/>
<br/>
To accomplish such results, the patient<br/>
must be under the direction of the physician<br/>
far longer than the custom is at present. The<br/>
supervision that is needed for health education<br/>
could be carried out in this way:<br/>
<br/>
Within an hour of the centre of New York<br/>
City there should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>a thoroughly<br/>
equipped, modern home, hospital and sanitarium<br/>
combined. There should be a large expanse<br/>
of rolling country land around it. The house<br/>
should be so arranged that every room would<br/>
have sunlight. It should be beautiful, cheerful, and thoroughly comfortable. There should<br/>
be reading rooms and libraries, gymnasiums,<br/>
bowling alleys, music rooms, workshops,<br/>
skating rinks, golf links, and swimming pools.<br/>
There should exist opportunities for boating,<br/>
canoeing, and sailing.<br/>
<br/>
CORRECT HABITS OF LIVING'AND WORKING<br/>
<br/>
All this should be under expert counsel. The<br/>
proportion of physicians to patients should<br/>
be something like one to twelve. Every<br/>
person should be put upon a course of work<br/>
designed to restore him to health, and he<br/>
should be put upon this work as soon as it was<br/>
feasible for him to begin. These periods of<br/>
work should be steadily lengthened day by<br/>
day, until the time arrived when the man or<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
