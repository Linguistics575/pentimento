CROMER,

Seymour's flagship off Alexandria the bombardment which was to open the doors of work
and glory to him. Moncrieff and Garstin he
knew and favored; from Cassel he accepted
the shared benefit with full knowledge and
approval; Tewfik's loyalty, Nubar's broad
common sense, the bold reforms of Riaz-all he tested and all he set in their due place
for the great work of regeneration which was
entrusted to him. Never a man whom he had
chosen disappointed him. But the man himself remains as elusive as the Sphinx seven
miles awayacross the Nile. It may be that
the man's entire simplicity conceals no art at
all, but no one living can put his finger on the
secret of his success. After all, men who in
times of stress drive their fellows before them
know little how they do it, and care less. The
secret of Rhodes's tremendous force died with
him. Clive lived to be criticized only by those
who did not know him. Wolsey was to foreigners a butcher's dog; to Englishmen he was
the inevitable influence and the savior of his
generation. Napoleon and Nelson are as
inexplicable. Men of this kind do not study
methods; they accept results and hardly know
that they have contributed to them. It is a
hard matter to follow the lead of such men,
but Lord Cromer has followed them.

SIR ELDON GORST

Lord Cromer is to be succeeded by Sir Eldon
Gorst, a handsome man with a vast acquaintance with every detail of Egyptian administration and finance. He succeeds to the superintendence of a structure of which the designs
are finished, the foundations are laid, and the
building itself finished up to the first string
course. It may be that the extension of the
building will be in his hands; it may be that
he will have to fight for the carrying out of the
existing designs. Should he fail in any part,
he at least cannot plead ignorance, for no man
in Egypt knows Egypt like Sir Eldon Gorst.
The work that lies before him on the lines laid
down is enough to wear a man's energy out.
Not until the new bed of the hill, zoo miles
long, is cut above the Sobat; not until the Great
Lakes themselves are dammed for the eternal
benefit of Egypt, is England's work in northeast Africa finally established. Yet what
work it is that Cromer hands down to be carried out! Each inch of dam in the gorge of the
Victoria Nyanza is worth twenty-seven Assouan
reservoirs full to the brim. The very concep

tion of the thing is bewildering. Egypt, from
being the close valley of the Nile, will have
become a latitudinal fact. One day the desert
oases will find their occupation gone; one day
the dykes of the Canal will keep fresh water
in as well as hold salt water out. Nothing
less has Cromer set before him as a goal; nothing
less will be demanded of his follower.

There is something fascinating about this
slow invasion of almost prehistoric places from
the influence of which no man can wholly
escape. It was once remarked of Khufu that
had he utilized in another and more usual
manner the national brute force and endurance
which went to build the Great Pyramid, he
would have been king from the Cataracts to
the Euxine; and the criticism is probably true.
It is also probably true that his successor, a
man as relentless, might in the same way-had he cared to do so-have exchanged cubic
feet of stone for square miles of European
dominion. Discipline, endurance, meat; these
were the three requisites; all were there to be
used and, had the idea struck an Egyptian
king of that day, he might have spent his
summers on the Riviera, and the fate of the
world would have been strangely different.

THE KEY TO EGYPT'S FUTURE

Water! There is the whole Egyptian problem in a word. For only if Egypt should
become poor again, only if the security it offers
for the millions there invested should be
lessened-only in that case will Europe once
more interfere with its affairs. And the wealth
of Egypt depends not upon this thing nor upon
that, but upon water. There is no better soil
than this thirsty and crystalline desert sand,
and the men who give Egypt water, men like
Moncrieff and Garstin, solve the question that
no one has faced since the Fayoum irrigation
scheme was mooted. There is little to trouble
Gorst along his horizons; the only anxieties
are at his feet.

But here in Egypt, the old abuse creeps in.
It is the same everlasting story of the contact
between West and East. The East is rescued
by England from disease, cruelty, starvation,
injustice, dirt, and despair, but no solitary
flash of gratitude ever lightens the work of its
benefactors. Even Cromer referred with a
touch of sadness to this. He quoted a Frenchman's observation as the summing up of the
matter: "When a people has suffered too
much, it scarcely has strength enough to
