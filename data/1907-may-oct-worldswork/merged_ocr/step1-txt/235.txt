Little strips and particular places in Florida
have become known by the visits of great numbers of health and pleasure seekers, especially
along the chain of the great Flagler hotels.
Mr. Flagler, by the way, has done more to
make the state known, perhaps, than any other
man ever did to make any other state known.
An increasing number of visitors who go for
health remain there. But, in spite of this great
stream of travel in the winter and of the work
of exploitation done by the railroad systems,
Florida is yet not only undeveloped-it is
almost unknown, and much of it has hardly
been explored. If you will remember what
drainage and artesian wells will do for a low
country, you will be able to think of this marvelous peninsula as capable of maintaining as
large a population as now live in any two or
three Southern States.

An era of definite industrial activity has
begun with great vigor. Jacksonville was
rebuilt after the blessing of a disastrous fire in
1901, rebuilt as a healthful industrial city.
The 2,600 buildings that were burned were
valued at $ 15,000,000; the 6,350 that have
since been built are valued at $ 27,500,000.
This is the great distributing place for the whole
peninsula and this fact (apart from its manufactures and tourist business) is making it an
important city and will make it a large city.

Of the truck farming-such figures as these
(for the crop of 1905) are simply wearisome, significant as they are of wealth-earning:
Of two minor crops, tomatoes brought a
million and a quarter dollars, and celery more
than a third of a million-an average for celery
of $ 1,300 an acre. The best examples of
outdoor intensive farming in the East may be
found on some of these truck farms. A Jerseyman who makes $ 1,500 a year on his home
farm of considerable acreage goes to a small
town in Florida in winter for his health. He
plants the back of his town lot in celery and
gets $ 2,500 for his winter crop. The orange
and grape-fruit crop yields more than three
millions of dollars a year; pineapples and
strawberries each $ 600,000; and all vegetables
nearly 4 millions-a total of about 8 millions
of dollars a year from fruit and vegetables.

The turpentine workers and the lumbermen
are working (and depleting) the pine forests;
but the enormous wealth of the hardwoods
of the state has yet hardly been touched. The
state has 200 varieties of trees--47 per cent.
bf all varieties found in the United States.

The general activity of the cities is indicated
by the increase in the number of banks since
1902 from 46 (with 14 millions of deposits) to
106 in 1906 (more than 32 millions of deposits).
But the area of activity is yet a very small
area. The state is the largest cast of the
Mississippi River. The distance from the
western extremity of the state to its southernmost extremity is almost as great as the distance
from Jacksonville to New York, or as the distance
from New York to Chicago. The state has 1,200
miles of coast, and it has 42 rivers and 1801akes
of considerable size and a much larger number of
small ones. Of its 34 millions of acres (not
counting more than 3,000,000 acres under
water) only 5 millions are "farm lands," only
a part of which is really cultivated. In the
well-drained regions, vital statistics show a
lower death rate than Massachusetts or New
York or Philadelphia.

Key West, with the marine railroad built to
it, will lie on the quickest route to Havana.
Tampa, on the Gulf coast, is an exceedingly
energetic city. The basis of its prosperity
was its cigar factories, of which there are
more than 150; but it has rapidly developed
other industries also. In and around the city,
including the suburban places, the local estimate
now is of a population of 41,000. It had less
than 6,000 people in 1890. Nearly 1,000
ocean-going vessels a year are required to do
its trade. The people are making money and
enjoying themselves, extending the city, building beautiful homes, feeling proud of themselves, and enjoying life. And within the
last five years, "Tampa has doubled all the
essentials of a city."

Or consider the growth of Pensacola, whose
export business has grown five-fold in ten
years. Cotton stood first-almost IO million
dollars' worth; then lumber and tobacco and
rosin and phosphate rock-this because of its
excellent harbor, "enough in depth and in
expanse to anchor all the navies of the world."
The city bonds, issued for public improvements, have been sold at a premium;
and the people are building bank buildings
(one of marble), big business structures, clubs,
residences. It is a pleasant place to go or to
