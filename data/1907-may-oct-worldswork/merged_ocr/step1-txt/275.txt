THE STORY OF ENGLAND IN EGYPT

parasites in Egypt whom he could not call to
account without the cooperation of their
consuls; and there was a Khediv t and a native
government whose pride must be preserved
and in whose name everything must be done.
It was a Western job to be done in an Oriental
way.

This Oriental way is the way that leads the
average Westerner to madness. Take, for
example, the farce of Turkey's confirmation
of the present Khedive on the death of his
father in 1892. Before the British fleet waiting
in the harbor could tire the salute in his honor,
it was necessary that the official firman from
the Sultan of Turkey be read from the steps
of the palace. All Cairo was kept in a state of
agitation for weeks by conflicting reports about
this important document. "It had started.
It had not started. It really would have started
but the caligraphy had at the last moment been
found defective" The British admiral, overcome with weariness, steamed away. At sea,
he met the ship bearing the firman and returned with it salute to the Khedive's accession.
