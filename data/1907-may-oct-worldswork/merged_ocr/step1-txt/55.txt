FRICK, THE SILENT 8853

"The future of a man who has accomplished so much
in a life not yet forty years in extent, could hardly be
predicted. Indeed, it would seem almost impossible to
estimate the probabilities.'Bright, active, and brainy,
this young man has shown already the possession of the
highest qualities of financial generalship and business
management, and the fact that he is universally recognized
as one of the most prominent men of Pittsburg is sufficient
to give promise of an exceptionally brilliant and useful
career."

This judgment took more practical form in
that same year, when Mr. Carnegie chose Mr.
Frick for chairman of Carnegie Brothers &
Company, Limited, the reorganization of
Carnegie Brothers. There was an underlying
purpose in this selection. The Carnegie were
embroiled in labor disputes over a change
they proposed to make in the system of paying
wages. Hitherto the wages had been paid
on a tonnage basis; that is, the men received
so much per ton produced. The increase in
production by means of improved machinery
without a proportionate increase in the number
of employees had caused the wages of some of
the men to rise as high as $ 15 a day. Mr.
Andrew Carnegie tried to change this state of
affairs by substituting the sliding scale as a
basis for wages. Under the sliding scale,
wages would be proportioned to the prices
received by the company for raw steel.

Mr. Carnegie had put his proposition of a
new wage scale to the test in 1889, and he had
been practically routed by the Amalgamated
Association of Iron and Steel Workers. He
had to consent to a three-year agreement that
was obnoxious to him. He determined, therefore, to be in better condition to fight in 1892,
and he looked for the strongest man to lead the
fight, That man was H. C. Frick.

THE HOMESTEAD BATTLE

Mr. Frick at once began to strengthen his
hands for the conflict. F irst, he would complete
the Carnegie monopoly in the Pittsburg steel
industry. This he achieved by the purchase
of the Duquesne Steel Works, which he bought
for the company with $ 1,000,000 in bonds.
The bond issue was a clever device, for the
works earned the value of the bonds during the
first year, so that they cost the Carnegie Company practically not one cent.

The other task of Mr. Frick's defensive
campaign was to unify the corporate control
of the subsidiary corporations of the Carnegie
steel interests. On July I, 1892, he consolidated all these scattered interests into one

corporate body, under his control, as the
Carnegie Steel Company, Limited.

Mr. Frick was now ready to give battle.
Mr. Carnegie entrusted the whole responsibility of the approaching strike to Mr. F rick,
and went to Scotland, where he remained in
unbroken seclusion during the dramatic episodes that followed. Mr. F rick carried on the
negotiations with the strikers, who conceded
the principle of the sliding scale, but who
refused to agree to other demands of the company and who insisted on the recognition of
the Amalgamated Association. On July I,
1892, a strike was declared at the Homestead
works, and the strikers took possession and
fortified the works.

It is not necessary here to go into the details
of the Homestead strike. They are ancient history, and the justice of either side's demands is
still in dispute. But so far as its events throw
light on Mr. F rick's character, it is sufficient
to assume that he believed the demands of
the company to be fair, and to know that,
whether he thought them fair or not, he fought
out their consequences with silent persistence
through riots, bloodshed, threats of assassination, and a storm of public execration which
he made no attempt to conciliate or appease.

After the strike was declared, Mr. Frick
demanded that the sheriff of Allegheny County
protect the company's works at Homestead.
Four thousand armed strikers deported the
sheriff and his deputies and sent them home
to Pittsburg. Mr F rick replied with two
barges loaded with 300 armed Pinkerton
detectives. The strikers met them with rifle
shots and dynamite, and after a day of battle
in which ten men were killed and sixty wounded,
captured the Pinkertons and disarmed them.
A week later 8,000 State troops put an end to
the private war.

During these days of violence, Mr. Frick
was besieged with every form of pressure to
induce him to end the strike. Public opinion
throughout the country raged against him.
Political influences worked upon him, and the
hostility of a Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania hampered his fight. To all appeals
he was obdurate. He had made up his mind
that he would win this time, as he always had
won before, and at any cost. His life was
threatened. He walked or rode to his office
daily, unattended and unafraid.

On July 2 3d, a Russian anarchist from New
York named Berkmann, who had no connec
