TO MEET THE RAILROAD

less valuable to-day than they were ten years
ago. Yet ten years ago the city could sell 3).
per cent. stock for a better price than it can
now sell 4 per cent. stock.

The cause is not in England, nor in France,
nor in New York. It is in underlying economic
conditions. Money is scarce the world around.
Such a tremendous amount of capital is needed
to carry on great works in all lands, the mills,
the shops, the railroads, the canals, the farmsin a word commerce that it is more and more
difficult to borrow great sums of money for other
purposes. For instance, the United States alone
has sent, within the past few years, perhaps half
a billion to help develop Mexico, another quarter of a billion to build mills, railroads, and
street railways in Cuba; yet another quarter of
a billion to open up the Philippines. Great
Britain has poured probably a billion dollars
into South Africa since the war ended. England and the United States together sent more
than a quarter of a billion dollars to pay the
debts of Japan. These are but instances. They
show how the cash of the world has been drawn
into fields untilled by our fathers.

T rue, the increasing gold supply has gone
far to offset the drain; but it has not met it by
probably many billions of dollars. For, at
this very time, when the old lands are pouring
out their money for the building up of the new,
the old lands themselves are demanding more
and more money-money in billions for railroads, money in billions for business. And,
between all these insistent demands, the private
investor stands supreme, the master of the
situation. If New York City will not pay
him more than four dollars interest on his hundred he will lend his money to Japan, at five
dollars, or even to a mining company, at twenty,
in promises. It is merely the old principle of
supply and demand. And, since New York
City is demanding and the public is supplying,
New York must come to the public's terms;
for that is the way of the business world. The
man with money has no favorites. Other
things being equal, he chooses the creditor
who pays him best. And this is the fact that
underlies these strange phenomena of latterday finance.



TO MEET THE RAILROAD NEEDS

HERE are three parties to the building

of every railroad or to its extension or
equipment. The first is the citizen, the second
is the person who supplies the money, and the

third is the plan-maker and actual constructor.
The trouble that the railroads present arises
from the dislocation of these three parties.
The citizen elamors for railroads, for more
cars, for more locomotives, for everything that
goes to make a railroad. The man with the
money refuses to advance it until the citizen
stops brandishing a legislative club. The
builder, meantime, also is afraid of the citizen,
but he makes most of his prayers to the man
with the money.

Now this is the gist of the condition that has
been and will be the theme of so many public
addresses, letters, essays, warnings and pleas.
It is very far removed from the ideal condition.
Properly the citizen should come to the builder
and ask for facilities, not eringingly nor yet
as a bully, but as one business man makinga
contract with another business man. If the
builder is satislicd, he should be able to call
upon Capital quickly, obtain funds, and then
go ahead and build the road, or buy the new
equipment, or do the double-tracking requisite.

But because of this dislocation Wall Street
is despontlent, the State legislators are bitter,
for some of the people are savage, and the railroad magnates are not fit company for Godfearing men. What can be done? When
a disagreement of this kind occurs in a firm, or
in a single corporation, provided the firm or
the corporation is sound, it is generally easy to
reach an adjustment. Why cannot an adjustment be reached in this greater matter?

Of course, the real difficulty is that "the
Citizen" means eighty millions of people, "the
investor" means also a large number, and
there are perhaps not more than twenty
great railroad builders. The citizen in his
present mood declares that the builder is a
robber and a thief. The builder retorts that
the citizen does not know what he wants.
Meantime the man with the money decides to
spend it in South America, or Canada, or even
in Japan.

Yet there is a way of adjustment.
begin with, the rainoad builder must come out
in the open and let himself be seen He must
wash his hands of the disreputable stains left
by his dabbling in high finance, He must
move his residence from Wall Stem. What
would one say of a reformed pirate who still
maintained his ship upon the seas, though he
should now call it a yacht? In line, the railroad president or chairman who is to help
rather than to hinder the restoration of public
