notable results in philosophic or scientific
fields, or wherever cities have made exceptional progress in their public-school work, they
have been invited to participate in this exhibit.
Through the efforts of Lieut.-Governor
Ellyson, governor of the Exposition's Department of History and Education, and his chief,
Prof. J. A. C. Chandler, the educational and
historical exhibit is larger and more diversified
than any similar exhibit ever gathered in the
United States. The Department of State has
on exhibition fac-similes of the Declaration
of Independence, the Articles of the Confederation, and the Constitution, together with many
other interesting documents. The Treasury
Department maintains a small bureau of Engraving and Printing, which illustrates the
method of plate work used in that department.
The Post-Office Department has a model
post-office in active operation under glass,
showing how the mails are collected and distributed and demonstrating the workings of
the many new inventions connected with the
mail department. One of the most interesting
branches of this exhibit is that of the DeadLetter Office, where is shown the variety of
articles that pass through the mails misdirected.
In the Fisheries Department is the most
complete display of everything pertaining to
fish and fishing ever seen at any exposition.
There will be salt-water and fresh-water
aquaria, living fish from stream, lake, and sea,
and preserved specimens of every description.
The United States Government supplies the
live fish and a complete supply of fishing
apparatus from a fish-hook to a harpoon.

THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS

The archives of all of the older states have
also been drawn upon. From the State Library of Virginia have come the portraits of
all the Governors, whose names were familiar
to most of the sightseers in their school days
-Berkeley and Spottswood, of the Knights of
the Golden Horse Shoe, who penetrated to the
mountains of Virginia and West Virginia;
and Patrick Henry. The Virginia Historical
Society has on exhibition one of the rarest
collections of colonial relics and papers in
existence. One of the contributions of the
Old Dominion is a collection of portraits of the
Jaquelin, Ambler, and Sherwood families,
who lived on historic Jamestown Island.
Many articles from the old, original town are
exhibited, among which will be the silver used

THE JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION

in the old Jamestown church, on the foundations of which, not long since unearthed, there
is being erected a duplicate of the old structure.
Old printing and presses from the Henkel
Shop at Newmarket, made famous in the
Civil War, have been sent, as well as the patterns of the first Confederate ironclad, the
Virginia, the rebuilt Merrimac.

Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, and the later-formed
state of Ohio are elaborately represented in this
section. Ohio has one of the finest archaeological exhibits in the United States, and this is
now at the Exposition.

The Colonial Dames, the Daughters of the
American Revolution, and the United Daughters
of the Confederacy have assembled collections
that are representative of the respective periods
from which their societies take their existence,
and the exhibit is made up of loans from all
parts of the United States.

The fact that these priceless relics were to be
kept in fire-proof buildings won for the Exhibition many contributions that would not
otherwise have been brought here. The original building, which was found not large enough
for the exhibits, has the appearance of being
a wing of the Auditorium and Administration
Building, being connected by a peristyle. In
addition to this, a new building, also fire-proof,
has been erected, 90 feet front and 300
feet deep.

TRANSPORTATION AND HOTELS

The grounds are within easy reach of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News, and Old
Point Comfort by electric car and by boat.
A ride of twenty minutes from any of these
places lands one on the grounds. Radiating
from Norfolk and the immediate vicinity are
eight great trunk lines and five short lines of
steamers, four Chesapeake Bay and four river
lines, and three river and canal lines.

The exposition being within a short ride of
Norfolk, Newport News, Hampton, and other
cities and resorts, the problem of hotel accommodations ought to be an easy one. The
diagram on the opposite page shows the
distance to each city. Visitors who prefer
outdoor life to the bustle of a crowded
hotel can make arrangements whereby the
comforts of a seaside resort may be combined with the attractions of the exposition
city.
