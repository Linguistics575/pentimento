WHY THE PRESIDENT'S POPULARITY

commend them to the people. Else those
become leaders who capture the party machinery and get command mainly by physical
--that is to say, financial-strength. For the
moment, there are but two men in national
politics who have large personal followings-Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Bryan. The policies
that Mr. Roosevelt stands for will force a real
leader to the front-Mr. Taft, for example;
or, if this fail, some man of another type may
get control by mechanical methods, such as
Mr. Fairbanks. But, in the Democratic party,
there is no man but Mr. Bryan who stands
for any specific policy, and the mechanical
machinery of his party seems to be in the hands
of his friends. The Democratic party will,
of course, come to life and come into power
again-perhaps even in the next campaign, if a
Fairbanks secures the Republican nomination.
But, unless its enemies give it such a chance,
it will first have to have a great impulse or to
produce a great leader.

WHY THE PRESIDENT'S POPULARITY GROWS

THE President keeps his popularity and
even widens and deepens it; and those
who think in the political terms of suaver and
gentler Administrations continue to wonder
that this is so. By all the rules of official
dignity and gentleness, he ought now to be
regarded as a reckless, dangerous, excited
pilot who will surely run the ship on rocks at
the next turn. Hear his loud talk and see his
wild gestures! Alas, the dignity of the great
office! And in their wonder at his continued
popularity, they say that he is the most astute
politician that we have ever had, fooling the
people not some times but allt he time. The
inexplicable, deluded people, will they applaud
the very wrecking of our institutions?

It is in this tone that most of the daily papers
in New-York, for instance, are talking, -in
tones of pity either for the Great Office, for
the President, or for the silly people. As for
the Great Office, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew
Jackson, and Abraham Lincolnoheld it; and,
while they held it, a large part of the critics
saw the impending ruin of our institutions and
despaired of the judgment of the people who
seemed to like these ungentle revolutionists.
The journalistic criticisms of these three great
positive Presidents was as a storm to a breeze
compared with the present criticisms of Mr.
Roosevelt. It is instructive reading to turn
back and see how almost every vigorous man

in the White House was "destroying our
institutions" and how the silly people applauded the destruction, and then to observe
how men came later to look back at most of
these vigorous Presidents as philosophic and
even as gentle and long-suffering leaders.

In fifty years-or ten years perhaps-Mr.
Harriman, for instance, will be as dim a figure
as Jay Gould now is, or dimmer, and the present political clashes between persons of this year
or next will be known only to diligent students
of our political history. Even the scandals
about campaign funds will be forgotten. Men
will not know who Bliss and Cortelyou and
Odell and Penrose were-nor who lied and
what he lied about, and who paid and what he
paid for, and who conspired and what he conspired about, and who told cock-and-bull
stories and who got drunk and babbled-nobody will care about these things year after
next, to say nothing of ten or fifty years hence.

But boys half a century hence will read in
their histories and all the world will know and
remember a few simple great facts such as these
(for it is only a few simple great facts that the
world finds it worth while to remember):

"Theodore Roosevelt was the most popular President
that the United States has had since Washington. He
came to the Presidency at the time when the Republic
first fully felt its strength, and his temperament fitted the
vigor of its mood. We had acquired outlying possessions
as a result of a war in which he served. Under his administration, we shaped our colonial policy; the Panama Canal
was begun; Government had an unprecedented
influence abroad. At home the plan of reclaiming our
desert lands was made; and the work of saving and renewing our forests was begun, and the policy of improving
and utilizing our river systems was laid down. It was
under his Administration that great land thefts were
stopped, and that the army was made energetic and the
navy strengthened. This was the period when great fortunes were made by unregulated corporations, whose
leaders threatened the control of the people in politics and
in government Great interests had their silent privileges
and their Senators, their vested rights and their legislatures.
It was President Roosevelt who exposed them and punished them and again made the law respected. He
refused to become a candidate for a third term and he used
his popularity with the people to have his policy continued
of forbidding the corporations to control the Government
and of living above the law."
