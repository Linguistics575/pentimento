There is also an economic reason why our
farms should soon be equipped with electricity.
It will make farming more profitable. An
electric motor will save farm labor, and labor
is now hard to get. It will supply energy to
draw water, to run the milking machines, to
thresh wheat, to gin cotton, and to do a hundred other things. On a farm in Germany,
near Berlin, is" an electric plow. It runs by a
trolley wire which it automatically moves over
three rows on every trip; it plows three furrows
at a time and does the work of fifteen horses.
When the farmers see the uses they can make
of electricity, if the companies do not supply
them with power they will build their own
plants, as they have built their own telephone
lines. We may soon see many a farmer living
in an "electric" house, efficiently working his
farm by electric power, loading his proddce on
the freight-cars of a trolley line, and settling
its price with a purchaser a hundred miles
away by telephone-perhaps by a wireless
telephone, for there is already such a thing in
existence. He can send his photograph, if he

wish, or sign a check over a wire. He may
sit in his home and listen to music from a telharmonium in a neighboring city. All these
things are possible with apparatus already
made.

And these are commonplace achievements
compared with the possibilities of electric
development. The storage battery that electricians are working toward will eliminate the
worst features of our automobiles, take the
trolley wires from our streets, and make most
farm machinery electric. Sir Hugh Bell has
predicted that a century hence, with little or no
machinery aboard and scarcely any crew, ships
will be sped on their voyages by electricity
generated at Niagara Falls and transmitted
wirelessly over the Atlantic. Either the invention of the storage battery or the discovery
of wireless power transmission would be
almost enough to insure a commercial flying
machine. Yet, should no new electrical inventions be made, we have already enough to
make us far more comfortable and to enable
us to save much time and lost motion.

CAN TEACH US

Americans, occurs a most serviceable

text for a lay sermon on "What France
Can Teach Us." Mr. Mason writes with
authority, being United States Consul-General
in Paris: "It is well known that, notwithstanding limited resources in coal and metals,
with not a pound of cotton or petroleum, with
a stationary population and heavy burdens
of public debt, France is one of the most prosperous nations. Paris, gorged with money,
has become the banker of Continental Europe."
Then he explains: "The underlying causes
of this prosperity are a genial climate, intensive cultivation of a fertile soil, industry
and frugality of the working classes, and, above
all, the instinct of artistic taste, fostered and
developed by education and governmental
influence until it has become a national attribute." In other words, France-a handicapped nation-has triumphed by the simple
and praiseworthy device of using its wits.

IN THE last epistle of Mason to the

Instead of looting the land, as we have done,
and leaving it strewn with abandoned farmsteads, the French agriculturist takes thought
both for to-morrow and for the centennial or
millenial of to-morrow. He tills every available inch of his little holdings and raises them
to the highest pitch of productivity compatible
with prudence; he conserves their resources
by putting back into the soil all he takes out
of it; he has been at this for a great many
centuries, and the farm lands of France are
to-day as rich as ever-perhaps richer.

So in industry-especially in the work of
French women. By an ingenious employment
of their native shrewdness, they have found
ways to make every moment of the day productive. While tending sheep, vending flowers
or newspapers on the curb, guarding railroad
crossings, or selling tickets in the stations, or
while sitting behind the counters of tobacco
shops, they diligently ply their needles, and sell
their work to the great department stores.
