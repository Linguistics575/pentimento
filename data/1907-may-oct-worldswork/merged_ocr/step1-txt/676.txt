placita. The highest part of each pueblo will
be about seventy feet. Each pueblo will measure about a thousand feet around the outer
walls. Small porticoes on the roofs, the massive outside buttresses, and other features of
construction will complete the semi-pyramidal
effect which characterized the ancient villages.

One each side of the avenue which will separate the two pueblos is a fifteen-foot sidewalk,
bordered on the inside by weeping willows and
on the outside by quick-growing cottonwoods

used temporarily for effect, shade, and ornament, pending the growing of elms and other
hardwood trees, hundreds of which have already
been started in the nursery on the great campus.

That the effect of the whole architectural
scheme will be extremely beautiful and stately
is now evident from the appearance of the completed dormitories, the central heating plant,
and the president's residence, all built in the old
Indian style. Art, economy, and durability are
most effectually combined. A recent feature of
the campus is an immense sun-dial in front of
the "Ho-ko-na," the gift of the class of 1907.
The dial is accurately adjusted and decorated
with inscriptions and symbols.

One of the pueblos will be used exclusively
for women students and the other for men; they
will meet a very pressing need for increased
accommodation as the number of students
increases. The old buildings were wholly
inadequate.
