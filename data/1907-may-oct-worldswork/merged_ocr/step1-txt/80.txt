8878 THE FUR TRADE
But while rabbit is the fur most used-the
greatest sinner in all the long list of shoddy
imitations--it wears out quickest and so renews its own demand. In fact, rabbits have
become such a hunted pest in California and
Australia that they are actually developing the
claws and climbing qualities of tree-nesters.

I have already referred to the millions of
muskrats sent from the swamps of New Jersey

OF THE WORLD

and what is more, it is an imitation that wears;
and one often sees excellent muskrat imitations
of ladies' mink coats. Muskrat is one of the
few imitations that does more lasting service
than its prototype.

It takes an expert to tell diamonds from
paste nowadays; but he who runs may read the
difference between chinchilla and dyed cat,
between rabbit with black dots stuck over it



$ 35,000 WORTH OF FURS

Mr. Colin Fraser sorting out black fox skins from his stock

and Delaware. As many again are yearly sent
from Canada; as many from Russia and
Austria. Whether it be that the Russian and
Austrian muskrats are finer than the American
or that the German dressers know their business better, certain it is that the best muskrat
skins come from the Leipsic sales. Here it is
that the beautiful gray linings for ladies' opera
cloaks and the heavy brown linings for men's
overcoats are bought-the soft fur of the under
body being used for the former, the backs split
off for the latter. The large Russian muskrat
can be dyed to a perfect imitation of marten;

and ermine of the jet tail-tip, between silver
fox which nature has silvered and a black fur
silvered by chemicals.

For trade purposes American squirrel may
be ignored. The squirrel of commerce comes
from Asia-the black from japan, the red
from Kazan, the gray from the Urals, the blue
from the Lena, the black- brown from Yakutsk
and Okhotsk. These go to the fur fairs of Germany and Russia, whence they find their way
to America. Monkey fur is a study by itself,
but it has not been so great a favorite with
fashion in America as in Europe.
