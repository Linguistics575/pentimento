to waste millions in school expenses, to keep
the tax books of private title companies up to
date while letting city books get years in arrears,
to lease dock and park privileges for a song,
to vote hundreds of millions without knowing
what service was paid for or what service was
rendered.

It is a mistake for a city to try to cure its
diseases of government by putting in power
men who will rely upon their integrity and
social standing rather than upon a knowledge
of the details of government. Experience has
proved conclusively that there is really nothing
about a good man that enables him intuitively
to know whether asphalt is seven inches or
three inches thick, whether specifications are
drawn for the advantage of one man, whether
money intended for vacation schools is diverted
to salaries of supervision, what the city debt is,

or whether taxpayers get their moncy's worth
of service, comfort and health protection.

If the Bureau's work in connection with
the Ahearn Inquiry promises more permanent
results than the moral upheavals with which
we associate past failures of good citizens to
keep their shanty in repair, it is because its
purpose is not to uncover gross scandal but
to remove the ignorance on which corruption
and inefficiency feed. Happily, too, the method
is within easy reach of every community--unlike the moral upheaval method which gives
the great cities all the scandals, not because
our small cities have a low percentage of
corruption and inefficiency, but because a
moral upheaval in a small town seems pitifully small in comparison with a similar
"revolution" in Philadelphia, Chicago, or
New York.

WHAT MIGHT BE DONE FOR THE BLIND

FIRST, PREVENT MUCH OF THE BLINDNESS, THEN

TREAT

THE SIGHTLESS SANELY AND TEACH THEM USEFUL THINGS

HELEN

HE American people have been liberal
in their gifts to the blind. Their at
titude has been one of sincere interest

and kindly expectation of success. There has
been generous provision to educate the children
and to surround the aged with comfort. Yet
the truth forces itself upon those who study

the problem that much remains to be done,

that there is some important work which has
not been even started in many of our states.

MUCH BLIXDNESS UNNECESSARY

To begin at the beginning, we have found
that much blindness is unnecessary, that
perhaps a third of it is the result of disease
which can be averted by timely treatment.
Then the instruction of parents and friends
in the care of blind children needs to be carried
to every corner of the country. We have before
us a long campaign of education to teach
parents that they must encourage sightless
children to romp and play and grow strong as
their seeing brothers and sisters do. Failure
to understand this, and the natural inclination

to shield and pamper defective children impose
upon the schools the unnecessary burden of
straightening crooked backs and deformed
limbs and correcting nervous habits, engendered by lack of intelligent discipline at home.
The backward condition of the pupils when they
enter the schools for the blind accounts in part
for the failure of some of our institutions in
the work they are intended to do. The failure
is due partly to the inadequacy of the schools
themselves. Thus we find need of improvement in training from babyhood to adult life;
and finally we discover a large class of adult
blind persons for whom, as yet, no provision
has been made in most American communities.

The records recently gathered by investigators show that even the educated, industrious
blind cannot earn their living without more
special assistance than they now receive. They
are so severely handicapped throughout life
that they cannot shift for themselves. Even
after careful training and apprenticeship, they
still need help to find their place in the world
of workers, a world which often does not
