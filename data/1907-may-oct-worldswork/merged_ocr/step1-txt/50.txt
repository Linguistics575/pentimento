Other photographers have taken telephoto
lenses into the woods to catch animals at long

Arthur Robinson is the first man to get successful
moose pictures with a moving-picture machine.

got to camp to get their instruments in order.
On leaving camp they gave the outfit to
two guides to carry over a portage. When
the photographers caught up again, the guides
were standing in the water, holding the canoes

which had to be taken apart, dried, and
adjusted again. Soon after they had started
the second time, they found a young bull moose
feeding in a pond, one side of which had a soft,
muddy bottom. This was exactly what they
wanted. Mr. Dugmore, in one canoe, kept

away into the woods. When the machine was
finally ready, the guides and Mr. Dugmore,
with both canoes, drove the moose ashore in
front of it while it made pictures of him with
the rapidity of a gatling gun.
