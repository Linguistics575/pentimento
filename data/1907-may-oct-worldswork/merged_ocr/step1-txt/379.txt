HOW TO INVEST SMALL FUNDS

yield a high return, in order that the investor
may live; yet in every case it calls at the same
time for an investment that shall be absolutely
safe, or as near it as we can come in this world.

Such an investor may fall into the hands of
a mining promoter, or an enthusiastic believer
in some new industrial. The problem is then
simple. The money goes into a venture that
may, or may not, pay very high returns, but
one that does not certainly contain a single
element of the safety that is the fundamental
principle of conservative investment. In a
large majority of such cases, the investment
points the way to the charity-ward or to the
poor-house.

Escaping this peril, the investor may come
upon a banker who will lightly undertake to
put the money into bonds or stocks that are
suitable for a business risk by a business man
or woman, but not for the innocent investor,
who has no way of watching the results of the
investment until she or he hears that it has
greatly increased in value, or greatly shrunk.

The writer has in mind the case of a
woman who lived in New Jersey, barely supporting herself and one child on the proceeds
of a life insurance policy invested in Newark
City bonds that gave her an income of $ 400
per annum from her capital of $ 120,000. She
had become accustomed to living on that
amount, and did not find it a hardship. She
planned that, when her boy came of age, the
investment should become his capital in some
small business enterprise.

In the early summer of tpor, she was induced
by a neighbor to go to a broker and listen to the
tales that were current concerning the common
stock of the United States Steel Corporation.
The broker was perfectly honest. He asked
about her investment. The income seemed
pitifully small to him. The substan" e of his
conclusions was contained in a letter, the gist
of which is quoted here, from memory:

"I do not advise you to invest permanently in a stock
like this; but I do firmly believe that the l per cent. divi
dends are to be considered safe beyond reasonable doubt
and that within a year or two this stock will be considered
cheap at $ 75 per share. I should advise you to purchase
250 shares at the current price, and hold them until the
stock becomes widely scattered among investors and the
price meets with its natural advance. At that time you
can sell it, and re-invest your capital in bonds. This
measure should increase the amount of your capital from
$ 10,000 to nearly 820,000. In the meantime, it will yield
you $ 1,000 per annum instead of the $ 400 per annum you
now enjoy."

This advice was disinterested, and perfectly
honest. Of course, it appealed strongly to the
investor. She sold her bonds and bought 2 So
shares of United States Steel common stock.
The broker bought it for her, transferred it
to her name, and delivered it to her. She put
it into a bank, where she also opened a savings
account. She was wise enough not to increase her scale of living to meet the increase
in her yearly revenue. Her living did not
reach $ 500, so that she saved, out of her income, nearly $ 1,000 in the two years that
followed. That money stayed in the bank
account.

Everything went well for a time. She read
one day that the Steel stock had gone over
$ 50 per share, and figured out that her 250
shares were worth over $ 12,500. It gave her
a feeling of comfort. Then came the awakening. Quite by accident, after a few months,
she heard that the stock was down to near 30.
She thought it was going to be all right, because only a few days before she had received
her dividends. She was quite sure it would
come up again. In that certainty, she let
things drift along, until, in December, 1903,
the usual dividend check did not arrive. In
its stead came a check for half the usual
amount. She did not understand it. She
wrote to the company, and, in time, was told
that the directors had found it necessary to
declare a smaller dividend because of the fall'ng off in revenues. The reply left her quite
uncertain as to whether or not she would receive another dividend, even at the reduced
rate.

She found also that her capital had shrunk
amazingly. The stock she had bought for
$ 10,000 she found worth little more than half
that amount. She saw that she could not sell
out and live on the proceeds of the sale. She
hung on grimly, hoping for the best. In
March of the next year, the worst came to pass.
There was no dividend at all. Her stock was
worth hardly $ 3,000. She had lost all faith in
the broker and had not gone to him at all for
comfort or advice. It was at this point that
she came to the writer to find out where she
stood.

It was a very bad case. At the market
quotations, at that time her stock was worth
only about $ 3,100, and the possibility of dividends seemed very remote. She had in the
bank nearly $ 1,000 cash. It seemed quite
impossible to get a living revenue out of that
