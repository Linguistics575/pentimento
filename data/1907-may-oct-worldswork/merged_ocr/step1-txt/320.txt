9118 WHAT FRANCE
bargaining-while it is to your wife, rather
than to yourself, that the proposition is mainly
addressed. This deference to the woman's
understanding makes for contentment in the
home; it conserves her self-respect; it recognizes her as the equal (if not more) of her
"lord and master"; and thus it fosters a tenderness and a fidelity as genuine-yes, and frequently as romantic-as in marriages founded
upon sentiment. It is almost solely in French
plays and French novels that the moral integrity of the home is held lightly-and there
only because the prevailing regularity lacks
dramatic or literary interest, to a degree,
whereas breach of regularity supplies it; besides, both drama and fiction are at present
the victims of a fashion-none too admirable-which will pass, in time, and be superseded by
a better and more representative.

One can hardly advocate the French marriage system in its entirety for America. We
are too sentimental to adopt it outright. But
we may advocate its respect for the economic
foundations of the family and its refusal to
countenance the mating of those who lack the
wherewithal to support themselves and who
so blithely trust to luck. We call this "romantic"; oftenest it kills romance. And one
must also admire the arrangement that frees
the wife of that sense of dependence which is
annoying at best and at worst degrading.

When I think of the Frenchman's deliberate
resolve to retire from business, I endorse it
whole-heartedly. Any Frenchman will forgive Russell Sage's close-iistedness, but no
Frenchman can forgive his sticking to his desk
all his days. No Frenchman can understand
it, for, to the Gallic mind, work is only a means
to an end. The great affair of life is not work;
it is life itself. And if commercial prowess
in America yields its splendid rewards-such
rewards as fame, power, and the satisfaction
of personal vanity-France has found a way
to distribute glory without asking a man to
sweat for it till he drops. Whereas the toiling
septuagenarian of New York may have his
palace, his villa, his art-treasures, and his
ocean-going steam yacht, and rejoice to see
them pictured in the Sunday papers, the
septuagenarian of Paris would give them all
for the little red ribbon of the Legion of Honor,
which means a larger fame, a more genuine
power, and a more soothing balm to selfesteem. It is for distinction as a man, rather
than as a mere winner and ruler of goods and

chattels, that he yearns. He honors work;
but he views it as Henry Ward Beecher viewed
a certain other factor of human life when he
exclaimed, in a generalization no less sane than
brilliant, "It is the test of every good institution
that it digs its own grave."

Now this world is so constituted that whenever a nation applies its mental energies to
securing certain definite advantages, certain
minor advantages seem almost to come of
themselves: and so it is thrift that has given
France its small, compact newspapers-of
from four to eight pages, printed in reasonably
coarse type and containing only the reading
matter its subscribers want-whereas we Americans, with our immense sixteen-page papers in
fine print, devote half our attention to deciding
what to skip. We endure this nuisance
because we have a mania for extravagant
advertising. The papers provide countless
columns of absolutely uninteresting "news"
in order to provide "pure reading matter"
next to the advertisements. Half the advertisers would retrench if they dared, but each
fears to cut down his space lest his rivals crush
him. Nothing but a general agreement, like
that proposed for the reduction of armaments
among the nations, could remedy the evil-an
evil which the French, by reason of their genius
for economy, have never allowed to engulf them.
Thus they supply themselves with newspapers
that suit the hand, the eye, and the intelligence.
Whatever the failings of French journalism,
these virtues-tether with the dignity that
enables them to publish articles by the greatest
French authors of the time and the custom
that requires reporters to sign their work-are certainly things to be envied.

And when the postman arrives, he doesn't
load you down with circulars, prospectuses,
announcements, and sham letters. The money
that is expended-and two-thirds wasted--upon that sort of advertising in America is
mainly saved in France, and everything you
purchase is thereby made less expensive.
"Send for our free illustrated catalogue" reads
like a charity, but the proprietor requires his
customers to pay the printer.

Thus far we have followed Mr. Mason's
explanation of French prosperity without
difficulty, but now we come to what is at first
glance a hard saying. He traces that prosperity not only to sane agriculture and to rare
industry and frugality, but "above all, to the
instinct of artistic taste, fostered and developed
