8816 THE
position of personal controversy with a subscriber to a campaign fund who has always
regarded his political contributions as purchases
of influence or of immunity.

The moral is two-fold and clear. (r) The tari ff, which gives a partya chance to swap protection for funds, must be removed before we shall
have done with this system; and (2) campaign
managers must be compelled by an enforceable
law to keep their books open-to make public
their receipts and their expenditures. If Mr.
Bliss and Mr. Cortelyou had been obliged to
write down and publish an item like this:

"Received from E. H. Harriman the sum of fifty thousand
dollars to be spent in --"

there would have been no such unhappy experience as we recently had in reading letters
that, under a decent system of campaigning,
would never have been written.

We had as well bend ourselves to these great
cleansing tasks now as later. It would be an
uplifting experience surely to be rid of such
scandals in the future.

THE FIRST LINE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL BATTLE

HE contest for the Republican Presi
dential nomination has begun in earnest
in Ohio. Senator Foraker stands for the
political machine and for policies that are
opposed to President Roosevelt; and he chal,
longed Secretary Taft to test his strength at a
party primary. The challenge was promptly accepted for the Secretary, who at the time was
in Panama, by his brother, Mr. Charles P.
Taft, of Cincinnati. The Republican primary
election thus contemplated may never be held,
but the contest between these two factions has
begun and will continue till some event clearly
indicates the public and the party preference.

This Ohio fight is noteworthy chiefly because.

it puts Secretary Taft clearly in the race.

For the endorsement of his own state will
put him foremost in line for the nomination.
He will stand, as no other candidate could
stand, for the Roosevelt policies of regulating
the railroads and other corporations, of our
island governments, of the Panama canal,
and the rest.

The contest is the more illuminating because
Senator Foraker admirably represents the antiRoosevelt influences in the Republican party-the old machine, a tacit alliance with corporate
disregard of the law, the complaisant programme of indulgence to the privileged classes

MARCH OF EVENTS

--in short, the policies that lead backward into
the old ruts and are meaningless when not
corrupt. For these reasons, this Ohio contest
looks very like the first thin line of battle.

THE DEMOCRATIC INDECISION

HE Democratic party in the meantime

presents a curious study to the student
of politics. It is giving no thought to the
next campaign. It shows no spirit. It seems
to have no hope. It develops no leaders.
It has no opinion that finds assertion. It
seems, without an effort at resistance, to have
surrendered to Mr. Bryan, whose chief claim
to distinction is that he has twice failed as a
leader and has not learned a leader's wisdom
by defeat. The sober part of the party does
not want him as a candidate again, and yet
no effort is made to prevent his nomination.
Now, when it is recalled that at least half of
the voters in the United States are Democrats
by tradition, if not by definite inclination and
doctrine, this momentary abjectness of the
great party is a very curious fact.

The meaning of it is plain. Both the old
parties, merely as parties, are moribund. The
life that either shows depends on the personalities of their leaders.

The most interesting and active public
leaders now are Republicans. The success of their party is, therefore, taken for
granted. Yet their party is strong not
because their party doctrines are strong. It is
their lead ers' personal strength with the people-the people's confidence in them. If there
were men in the Democratic party of great
personal popularity who had the quality of
leadership, the fact that they were Democrats
would not lessen their chance of success.
Probably it would help it. Mr. Bryan, if
we may guess from present indications, will
have an easy and even inevitable victory in
the nominating convention, because apparently
there will be no other candidate whom any
large number of the people know. Yet the
very men who expect his nomination and will
acquiesce in it expect him to be defeated.

It is an interesting thing to speculate about
-how parties find leaders. In times of great
moral earnestness, strong men are pushed
forward by this earnestness. But, when party
doctrines have become mere formulas, as
now, and it is chiefly the personal desire for
office or for power that impels men, those
men become leaders whose personal qualities
