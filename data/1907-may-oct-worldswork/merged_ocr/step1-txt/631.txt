THE HUMANITARIAN RULE IN

three years old have a large and comfortable
play hall; boys from three to eight and girls
from three to thirteen are placed in school.
All of these institutions are clean, homelike,
and operated without official tyranny or red
tape. Strange to say, their net result does not
seem to tend in any way toward the making
of professional paupers; on the contrary, they
seem to produce an extraordinary proportion
of self-supporting members of society.

AMUSEMENTS TAXED FOR CHARITY

An ancient and admirable institution, not
duplicated elsewhere, so far as I know, is the
Assistance Publique. Its history goes back to
Louis XIV, when it began with a tax of IO per
cent. on every theatre ticket; but for the
source of its truest efficiency you must look to
latter-day humanitarianism. Every year it
provides 15,000 free beds in the hospitals
and 15,000 more in the asylums. It has built
a great maternity hospital that cares for
mothers (and children, too), asking no questions
but merely giving the sisterly hand. Whenever the hospital may be full, or when other
reasons may suggest more extended relief, the
Assistance Publique hires experienced midwives to care for poor women at their homes.
It pays for the bringing up of thousands of
children; it provides free medicines for the sick
poor, sends to them visitors and help, and
expends $ 10,000,000 a year in its great benevolences. Of this sum $ 3,000,000 is for outdoor
relief and $ 70,000 for free medicines furnished
to the poor in their homes. The Assistance
Publique has also a function in the protecting
of workingmen. It takes charge of cases of
serious injury, and collects from the employer
in every such case $ 1.25 a day for the benefit
of the injured person, the payments continuing
so long as there is incapacity for labor. Employers may shift the. burden to accident
insurance companies, if they so desire, but
the $ 1.25 must be forthcoming daily. When
in Paris you go to a theatre, a concert, or to the
races, you may be pleased to reflect that you
are contributing to the support of a worthy
institution, for every amusement ticket carries
a tax for the Assistance Publique. Its receipts
from this source last year were more than
$ 800,000. The Municipal Council is behind

the Assistance Publique, helping it in many
ways.

On reasonable grounds, the Council desires
to municipalize the public utilities of the city.

RULE IN PARIS 9429
It has demonstrated that it can conduct such
enterprises to the increased welfare of the consumers and it needs great revenues for its vast
schemes to better conditions. Hence it desires
to take over and operate street railroads, motor
lines, underground roads, gas, electricity, Seine
steamboats, omnibuses, the undertaking business-everything in sight that can be operated
by municipal agents. The Council points to
the invariable success with which other continental cities have conducted the like ventures;
but always the Senate plants itself across the
path.

Naturally, the Empire encouraged the private
ownership of public utilities and tied up all
the services of Paris with long-term franchises.
But the Empire has been dead these thirtysix years and the franchises it granted are
expiring. And now comes on the question
whether they shall be renewed or be transferred to the municipality. The Council wants
them for the public welfare; the Senate insists
upon delivering them to private owners.

THE STRUGGLE FOR CHEAP GAS

One of the typical contests was over gas.
Paris gas, furnished exclusively by private
companies, was very high. Bent upon its way of
supervising life for all its people, the Council
desired to buy, build, and operate municipal
gas works. At the beginning of 1905 the
National Chamber of Deputies (the Lower
House), which usually sympathize with the
Council, passed the necessary enabling act;
the Senate promptly threw it out. The next
year the Council introduced another bill:
result, exactly the same.

On January I, 1907, the franchise of the old
gas company of the Empire expired; the
Council, without waiting for the Senate, took
over the property. But it could not legally
operate the works without the Senate's sanction,
and sanction the Senate resolutely refused to
give. The Council was therefore driven to
lease the works. Thirteen bids were received,
one from an American syndicate supposed to
represent the Standard Oil Company. When
the Council announced that it would require
the lessee to give to its employees all the rights
and privileges of men in the municipal service,
the Americans hurriedly withdrew. Five bidders were chosen from the remaining twelve
and from these will be selected one company
for the eventual prize. That is, if it will be
a prize when the'Council completes the form
