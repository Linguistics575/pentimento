TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

there. And there the Judge worked, making
corrections until the last minute, and as the
clock struck twelve, he entered the crowded
court room. Friends had begged him to
postpone his decision. At least, they said,
he could have it read by the clerk. And this
failing, they urged his need of a bodyguard.
The strikers had sworn that in the event of an
unfavorable decision he should never leave
the room alive. Taft sent Phelan to the
county jail for six months. The Judge was big,
magnificent, and his kind blue eyes were
blazing. His concluding words were for those
who were there to kill him:

"When you men leave this room," he said in
effect, "I want you to go with the conviction
that, if there is any power in the army of the
United States to run those trains, those trains
shall be run!" And down on the desk before
him came his great fist.

The strikers gazed up at him as men dazed.
Judge Taft rose and retired. The court room
was as quiet as a church. The strikers looked
askance at one another. They had not
realized what had happened, and then they
began straggling out, Quiet, awed, and uncertain. They had not known before that the
majesty of the law was such a solemn business.
Debs's mushroom organization of 250,000
members soon afterward collapsed.

But there were many among the strikers
who said that Judge Taft had given them a
fair trial. One day, about six months later,
a man with a coat slung over his shoulder
asked to see the Judge. The man was Phelan,
and he had just finished his sentence. The
labor element had not worked to defeat Mr.
Charles P. Taft for Congress, and Phelan may
have been disgusted with his own martyrdom.
But, at any rate, he was truly repentant. He
confessed the charges against him, which he
had denied at the trial. He had gotten what
he deserved, he said. Since coming out of
jail he had seen the misery of the former strikers,
and he was remorse-stricken. He was willing
to go back for another six months, he said,
if the Judge would only get those men reinstated in their jobs. Thereupon Judge Taft
asked the receiver to abolish the black-list, and
the men were taken back as vacancies occurred.

Almost every time that Labor has come before
Judge Taft, Labor has been in the wrong.
One regrets, on both their accounts, that Labor
could not have been in the right at least once
or twice; the Judge might have liked to

indulge his sympathy. But the irony of circumstances was against him. Once, when yet
in the Superior Court of Cincinnati, he had to
decide against the Bricklayers' Union, sustaining the verdict of a lower court for damages
done by conspiracy and boycott.

Again he had to issue a restraining order
against P. M. Arthur, chief of the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers. The Toledo & Ann
Arbor Railroad had a strike, and other roads
threatened to reject its freight, in fear of a
sympathetic strike. District Judge Ricks enjoined these roads from carrying out their
threat. Chief Arthur was included as a defendant, for he was ordering the employees of
these roads not to handle freight from the Toledo
& Ann Arbor, and did this even after the injunction. Brought for contempt before Judge
Ricks and Judge Taft, he pleaded ignorance of
the injunction. He got off with a notice to
rescind his orders. There was much bitterness at the time, but one of Arthur's counsel
has since come out in favor of Secretary Taft
for the Presidency.

HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD CORPORATE CRIME

Judge Taft was much more severely disposed,
however, toward big corporate insolence. If
to his mind there is any distinction in kinds of
lawbreaking, then he hates most that which
seeks immunity through wealth and influence.
For eight years after its passage, the Sherman
Anti-Trust Law was a dead letter. Efforts to
enforce it had failed, and even the Attorney
General gave up, announcing that the law was
inadequate. And then, after all these years,
a certain powerful combination was arraigned

before Judge Taft. The case was that
of the United States vs. the Addyston
Pipe & Steel Company, et al, With their
monopoly, the defendants had been taxing
every city that needed to lay a foot of cast-iron
pipe. For a month after the hearing, Judge
Taft delved and groped and fitted "tsrether, and
at the end of the month he came forth with L
decision that held good. It was really a treaty,
on that entire branch of the law in all its phases,
and is to-day perhaps the ablest work on the
subject. He began with the old common law
on contracts, and followed it through each
stage of growth and development to the last
law regarding contracts in restraint of trade.
He broke the legs under this particular
trust as cleanly as he had broken the backbone of the American Railway Union strike.
