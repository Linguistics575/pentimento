THE DANGER

Hamid is under the control and direction of
German diplomacy. "Germany is our friend,"
is a saying that has penetrated even into the
masses of the Turkish nation, and the Kaiser
has the full right to boast himself as the protector and champion of the Mussulmuns.

By tradition, by its dynasty, and by its
alliance, Austria plays the r√©le of a vanguard to
this German advance to the Near East. The
occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has
made Austria It Balkan power, and its plans
are ready for the march of an Austrian army
southward to the Gulf of Salonica, which will

on these shores in the very near future.

As to the nature of the Austrian advance, it
may be judged from the rule of Austria in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Austrian policy
in Bosnia has been one of terror, of espionage,
of famine, and of assassination. It is accomplishing the moral and material ruin of a
splendid country, the crushing of a noble
Servian race which has fallen beneath its hand.
It is a grave and grim story of misrule and
oppression. Spies are on every hand, and no
man knows at what moment he may be thrown
