Of the other revolutionary movements, four
were the birth-throes of South American
republics, and were directed against Spain,
Greece, Belgium, and Italy. Two others were
brought about by personal ambitions-the
revolt of Mohammed Ali in Syria and the coup
d'etat of Napoleon III. The last two revolutionary wars-the Indian Mutiny and our own
Civil War-had their origin, the first in the.
natural clash of two civilizations, the second in
the clash of two great principles.

Roughly, there were twenty important wars
in which the underlying causes were true international questions. Of these, three were
probably fought on principle, although the
price of victory in each case was territorial
aggrandizement. These three were the war
of France against Austria to establish the
Kingdom of Italy, in return for which France
became mistress of Savoy; the war that
followed England's interference in dynastic
troubles in Afghanistan; and our own war
with Spain.

Another division of this great group of wars
embraces three wars fought primarily and
principally for commercial reasons, not always
too lofty. The three wars are the so-called
"Opium War," whereby Britain forced the
opium trade into China; the Boer War; and
the Boxer troubles in China.

The fourteen other great international struggles were wars for territorial aggrandizement,
although in each case there were plausible
pretexts in the shape of national honor, commercial rights, and other considerations that
weigh with the nations.

Of the forty wars classified in the preceding
paragraphs, twenty-four appear to be of kinds
that might have yielded to a possible solution
through the medium of a peace movement
sufficiently powerful. The considerations upon
which this statement is based must be made
quite clear.

In the case of the twenty revolutionary wars,
a sharp distinction must be drawn between
the political and the racial wars. The experience of this period has taught the world that
arbitration, in the shape of armed interference
between the combatants is possible in the case
of purely political revolutions, and sometimes
in revolutions not purely political. England
and Russia helped Greece to freedom; France
helped Belgium to break the bonds of Holland;
England aided Turkey in the war against
Mohammed Ali; France came to the succor of

THE PREVENTION OF WAR
Italy; England interfered between Spain and
Portugal; the United States stepped between
Spain and Cuba.

There is no good reason to suppose that an
overwhelming world-movement for arbitration without arms would have met with failure
in any one of such cases. In them there is
seldom any great element of national honor
involved, nor is there any great underlying
vital principle. They are as purely political
struggles as are the annual elections in countries
where party feeling runs high. This is the
most promising of all the fields for the
newer apostles of peace.

Of course, it is hardly conceivable that a
peace-movement, however universal, could
have prevented the Indian Mutiny, the Civil
War in America, or the present outbreak of
bloody revolution in Russia. In India, an
ancient civilization was gradually encroached
upon by a new, all-conquering civilization. It
is too much to hope that, pending the millennium, any peace movement can touch the
roots of a struggle like this.

Our own Civil War was very different, yet
one must hesitate to class it as a contest that
could have been easily arbitrated. It was not
a revolution so much as it was a great war of
principle. When a strong nation, evenly
divided, fights for what it deems its God-given
rights, it would be a powerful movement indeed
that could prevent a clash of arms. To-day,
in Russia, one might well preach peace in vain
to hordes of men who have not had enough
to eat in years, whose mothers, sisters, or
daughters have been outraged or slain by the
soldiers of the Empire.

If the possibilities of the peace movement
are limited in the revolutionary wars, they are
doubly limited in the domain of international
war. Of the forty wars pointed out above,
fourteen-X per cCntr---arose from national
pride, from the desire of a nation to grow in
greatness and in territorial wealth. When
Peter the Great made his will, he bequeathed
to all his successors on the throne of Russia
a fixed, definite, never-to-be-shaken ambition.
It was to plant the banner of Russia over more
and more of the littoral of the Baltic and the
Black Sea. The fruit of that bequest within
the period covered in this discussion consists
of three great wars, costing in all more than
$ 500,000,000 in money and nearly 8oo, ooo
human lives. The Powers of Europe have
stood banded against the carrying out of this
