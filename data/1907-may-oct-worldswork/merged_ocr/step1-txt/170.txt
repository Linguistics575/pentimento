of all kinds of labor-saving machinery. One of
the photographs with this article is that of fifty
farm wagons loaded with modern machinery
going out from Burlington-and this is but one
illustration of the rapidity with which improved
farming implements are coming into use.
Fifty years ago, moreover, the farmers of
the Upland South wasted the lands-tilled a
field recklessly for a few years, then cleared
a "new ground" and abandoned the old to
broom-sage and gullies; but now this landdebauchery has ended. Crop rotation and
the legumes preserve the earth's fertility.
Every season a crop of land-enriching COWpeas may be sandwiched in between the
staple crops or cultivated in connection with
them. Farmers no longer scratch over 500
acres to make what intensive culture would
produce on 100. "Don't go West to find a
new plantation," says a new eastern-Carolina
proverb; "plow deeper and you will find
_,' Fa" a new one just below the old one you have
been scratching on."

Two stories from real life will illustrate
as well as anything else the whole story of
the state's farming progress.
