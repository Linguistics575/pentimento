AMERICAN

even if our Slavic and Italian and Hebrew
newcomers represented the solid citizenship
of the countries from which they spring, as
did the English and German immigrants of
forty years ago. But, by common agreement,
they do not. Our immigrants to-day are not
only of widely different racial antecedents;
they are distinctly inferior to those of earlier
times in the fundamental qualities of character
and economic status. In the last analysis,
the basis of judgment in the matter must be
the equipment, material and otherwise, which
the mass of aliens bring for taking up life
under American conditions and growing with
fair facility into self-reliant and productive
citizens. To be quite desirable, the immigrant
must have sufficient money to enable him to
live independently until he finds employment
and has an income upon which to rely for support; he must be sturdy and healthy in body,
capable of doing as much hard work as his
station is apt to involve; he must be of fair
intelligence-not necessarily "educated," perhaps not even able to read or write, but at
least possessing a mind susceptible of some
discrimination and sanity of judgment.

Some of these qualities are difficult to measure
and it would be foolish to attempt to affirm
just what proportion of our immigrants to-day
possess any or all of them, and in what degree.
Financial equipment is a tangible thing, however, and as that is a matter carefully inquired
into by the inspectors at our ports, we have
some information regarding it which is worth
while. The total amount of money shown
by the aliens admitted to the country in 1906
was $ 25,109,413, which looks like a big sum
until one figures out the average when distributed among more than a million people.
As a matter of fact, the record was not so good
as in the preceding year, when 75,000 fewer
immigrants brought nearly $ 50,000 more
money. Moreover, the resources of this sort
were very unevenly distributed. The 45,079
English brought an aggregate of $ 2,610,439,
while three and a half times as many Jews
brought only $ 2,362,125. The 144,954 Germans and Scandinavians brought $ 5,091,594,
while 263,655 southern Italians and Greeks
brought but $ 4,183,398. The average Jew or
Italian or Greek who lands at the Battery with
his fifteen dollars has obviously not a very long
lease of existence unless he finds ready employment, or is supported by friends, or falls
back upon public charity.

IMMIGRATION AT HIGH TIDE

Another fairly tangible standard of measurement is the educational test. What the immigrant's actual capacity of intellect may be
there are ordinarily small means of knowing.
But a record is kept of the amount of illiteracy
and this furnishes an index of considerable
value. The results thus attained confirm at
every point the impression that the mass of
our immigrants to-day will not measure up
with those of twenty-five, ten, or even five,
years ago. Of the 964,462 aliens over 14
years of age who were admitted in 1906,
265,068 could neither read nor write and 4,755
could read but not write. The figures for
1905 were 230,882 and 8,209 respectively.
That is, while the total illiteracy in 1906 was
about 28 per cent., that in 1905 was not more
than 26 per cent., which in turn was an increase of I per cent. over that of 1904.



IMMIGRATION WAVE, 1820 TO 1906

Showing the number of immigrants from all countries since the
preservation of such statistics began

One aspect of the situation which is capable
of various interpretations is the fact that the
percentage of arriving aliens who are debarred
from landing has noticeably increased. In
1902 the number was 4,974, or .76 per cent.;
in 1903, 8,769, or 1.02 per cent.; in 1904
7,952, or .94 per cent.; in 1905, 11,480, or
1.07 per cent.; and in 1906, 12,432, or 1.06
per cent. Obviously, in these times of heavy
immigration the number ought to increase
absolutely to signify simply the maintenance
of the traditional degree of vigilance at our
ports. Probably most of us would feel that
it ought also to increase relatively with mar
reliableness than the foregoing percentages
indicate that it does. As a matter of fact,
during the past eighteen months the proportion
of the debarred has been rather conspicuously
declining. It is to be hoped that this is due,
