unearthed and mercilessly exposed. Stock,
watering of the most flagrant character has
been revealed, beginning with the original
companies, and repeated at every step in the
consolidation. Deliberate slighting of the public and ignoring of its right to adequate facilities have been shown to be the usual policy of
the New York traction companies. Officials
have been forced to the cynical confession that
the "the strap-hangers pay the dividends." It
has been discovered that one set of books was
destroyed, to prevent the discovery of certain
financial acts, presumably irregular. The
whole traction consolidation has been laid bare
before the eyes of the public as a debauched,
misguided, and totally unfit servant of the
people.

This is the heart of the matter. In the
nature of things, a public utility company,
dependent upon franchises granted by the
public, is morally bound to serve the people.
The Commission has demonstrated beyond
all reasonable doubt that the New York companies have utterly failed in this duty; that they
have been conceived, financed, and operated
with an eye single to the gaining of profits by
financial exploiters; and that the very people
who gave life to the companies have been made
the victims of these companies.

Of course, it is not right to forget that the
present heads of the traction companies are not
technically guilty of the worst offences uncovered by the inquisition. Many of the
offences antedate all or nearly all the present
financial officers. It is to be presumed, however, that the ofhcers of to-day took up this
heritage of corruption, dishonesty, and trickery
with their eyes open. At any rate, the people
are in a mood to demand from the present
officers and directors a full and complete
explanation of all the irregularities. The
public is right, and the half-hearted attempt to
take refuge behind technicalities and legalities
will injure rather than assist these companies
and these individuals. It is a time for frankness and honesty, and open confession, if need
be, rather than for an attempt to fight against
an outraged public opinion by legal fence and
quibble.

The direct results, so far, have been unfortunate. The stocks and bonds that represent
these great properties have suffered grievous
declines. In this, thousands of innocent investors have suffered. That is a pity, but it is
certainly no reason for regretting the inquisition,

nor for attempting to stop it. It would be a
false and mawkish sentiment that should allow
these companies to take refuge behind the
skirts of the proverbial widow. There will
doubtless be a long and bitter fight in the courts,
an attempt to deny to this Commission, created
by the people specifically for the purpose of
investigation, the right to investigate. No
matter what the immediate outcome may be,
the ultimate end is certain. The people will
rule, no matter who oppose them.

The lesson of the investigation and of the
coming struggle in the courts is plain enough.
There are thousands of public utility companies
throughout this country. Every one of them
must be taught that it is a servant, not a master,
of the people. The younger the company when
the lessons begin, the better for the company,
the better for the people. It is because the
New York companies have been allowed by an
indulgent executive and a goodmatured public
to grow old in sin that the companies to-day
are tottering, and their stockholders are to-day
losing their fortunes. _

THE MOBBING OF CORPORATIONS

HE time that has passed since Judge

Landis fined the Standard Oil Company
more than 29 million dollars for violating the
Elkins law has won public sympathy for the
Company, and surely there has been a loss of
respect for the court; and loss of respect for
a court is a most regrettable thing.

The lay public did not at first clearly understand the case because it has long been in the
habit of accepting every accusation made of
the Standard Oil Company as true, whether
it were an accusation made in a magazine, a
newspaper, or in court. The Company has
so long been the pet abomination of the press
and the arch-criminal of all the trusts in the
public mind that it is at a great disadvantage
in the court of public opinion. The startling
fact about its trial, in this case, and about this
colossal fine, is that it is at a similar disadvantage in a United States court. That is reason
for pause and regret.

The Standard Oil Company of Indiana was
indicted for violating the Elkins law-for
shipping oil from Whiting, Ind. (a suburb of
Chicago), to East St. Louis, over the Chicago
and Alton Railroad, for six cents a hundred
pounds instead of eighteen cents. These facts
are undisputed: There are three railroads from
Whiting to East St. Louis, The Oil Company
