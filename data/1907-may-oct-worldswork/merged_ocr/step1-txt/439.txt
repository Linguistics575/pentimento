PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF CRAFT

Washington Square to Eighty-eighth Street,
which is being, studied as a model for future
cars to be constructed in this country. As yet,
it has not been run long enough to determine
whether the double-deck construction is a
profitable innovation in New York.

This synopsis of the situation in the three
largest cities of the world gives a hint of what
may be expected in this direction during the

9237

next five or ten years. It seems safe to
predict as quick a retirement of the overworked horse from the cab and omnibus
service as from the street-car system of two
decades ago. And the substitute service of
electric and gasoline motor cabs and'buses
should greatly help to relieve the congestion
of the surface and subway lines of our big
cities.

PENNSYLVANIA'S PALACE OF CRAFT

THE INEVITABLE HARVEST OF POLITICAL SHAME NOW REAPED
FROM THE SOWING OF BOSSES, FROM CAMERON TO QUAY

BY

CHARLES H. DARLINGTON

capitol on February 2, 1897, this story

of monumental graft; but back of that
lies another story dating from the days of the
Civil War. Out of three circumstances of the
earlier day it all came, like a flower from a bud
--Abraham Lincoln's need, a people's sterling
patriotism, and Simon Cameron's remarkable
talent as an organizer. Cameron's party was
the party of the Union, and the people of
Pennsylvania fell into ranks under his orders
and were drilled into a political machine that
was invincible. To the same music marched
the soldier with his musket and the citizen
with his ballot, with almost the same precision
of action.

Cameron found power a comfortable thing
to have. When the crucial days had passed,
he still held the Republicans of Pennsylvania
in the hollow of his hand. And, when ripe of
years, he sought to make his political power
hereditary by turning over the boss-ship and
the United States Senatorship to his son. But
J. Donald Cameron was of a different calibre
from his father, and the machine wabbled
badly.

In 1887 came on the stage and into the
Senate one M. S. Quay. With all of Simon
Cameron's talent as an executive and none of
his contentment, Quay soon had the leadership
in his own hands; ten years later Don Cameron
dropped under the surface of politics, with
hardly a ripple to mark the place where he
went down.

IT BEGAN with the burning of the state

The Quay administration was from the first
a money affair. The party always had plenty
of funds. People came" to wonder how it was
and, little by little, the impression grew that
the state treasury was somehow at the bottom
of it. Quay found it expedient in more than
one Republican state platform to assert most
unequivocally that under Republican administration the state treasury had never lost a
dollar. But distrust still grew and the demand
for an accounting became insistent. It was
held that Quay was the real Treasurer of the
state, holding the office through such men as
he chose to have elected to draw the salary, and
that the state law limiting the term to two
years and forbidding the treasurer to succeed
himself had been practically nullified. If anything were wrong, one agent of Quay could
pass it along to the next and keep it covered
from the public.

The treasury was fed by taxes on corporations
far beyond the state's needs, and the surplus,
rising gradually to ten or twelve millions-on
the books-was deposited in favored banks without interest. It was a fact, though, revealed in
1898, that the banks were paying interest, but
they were paying a compromise rate and paying
it into the treasury of the dominant party. The
mystery of easy money seemed explained. But
in 1905 the collapse of the Enterprise Bank at
Pittsburg revealed that it had millions of state
funds loaned out to politicians with no adequate security, and that machine politics was
able to make the bank good to the last dollar
