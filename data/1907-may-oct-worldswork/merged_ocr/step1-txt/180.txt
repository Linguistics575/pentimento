there was an almost riotous demonstration
when a delegate presented a proposition to
divide the school fund between the races in

make its training fit its needs. Teaching
agriculture is but a beginning; other industrial
features will be added; and county trade
schools will follow in time.

To-day the people demand the discussion

the South, the most significant social development of our generation; and in its spirit the
people are building their commonwealthsbuilding them on the broad foundations of a
genuine democracy, developing their industries
and the wealth of their resources. The joy
of constructive work indeed is now the South-.

these next fifty years the South will have the
tasks of an heroic age.
