THE NEW EGYPTIAN ARMY

The reorganization of the native army is
another example of good workmanship. When
Cromer went down into Egypt, he found its army
--as all the world knew-to be nothing more
than a joke; he "advised" the Khedive that
it be disbanded and a new army created. He
also "suggested" the names of a few English
officers that could turn the trick; one of
these was Kitchener. The briefest and most

Egyptians simply lucked the moral courage to
face a charge and turn it back.

The second chapter is best told by Kipling:

"Said England unto Pharaoh,'l must make a man of you

That will stand upon his feel and play the game;
That will Maxim his oppressor as a Christian ought to do,'
And she sent old Pharaoh Sergeant Whatisname.
It was not a Duke, nor Earl, nor yet a Viscount
It was not a big brass General that came;
But a man in khaki kit, who could handle men a bit,
With his bedding labelled Sergeant Whatisname."

The third part of the story was told in 1891
by Colonel Hollcd-Smith, in his report of a
fight on the same road to Tokar, with the same
enemy, and under the same conditions-EPT

Illustrating the great increase in Egypt's productiveness fostered by Lord Cromer's policies

dramatic way to tell the story of the reorganization of the native army is to give three
extracts.

First, here is the Egyptian fighting man of
1884, as pictured by General Baker in a telegram announcing the defeat of the native army
by the dervishes at El-Teb:

"hiarclwd yesterday morning with
Tokar.
small force of enemy, certainly less than 1,000 strong, the
Egyptian troops threw down their arms and ran, allowing
themselves to be killed without the slightest resistance.
More than 2,000 killed. All material lost."

The native troops were not wholly to blame.
They knew the wild frenzy of the dervishes,
who have been appropriately described as" all

tian troops and English officers in both cases. It
shows what seven years of good training can do.

"The bulk of their (the dervishes') force was directed
against the line occupied by the 12th battalion, their attack
being pushed home with their usual intrepidity and imp
lessness. The troops, however, stood their ground and
did not yield one inch throughout the line."

No one now has any apprehension about
the cfficierwy of the native army with its British
officers. They garrison the outposts all the
way up into the Soudan.

England's work for education is less
spectacular in results, but none the less revolutionary. It must be remembered that this is
a Mohammedan land, and that the Western
