that, whether asked about a legislative chamber
or about a chimney sweep, can find its answer
only in a reference to the purposes which the
institution is designed to serve, If it performs
the functions assigned to it, it is good; if not,
it is bad. The Constitution of the United
States has given functions to the Senate which
have little or no resemblance to those which are
or ought to be performed by the House of Lords,
and comparison is impossible. The German
Empire has a second chamber of a most remarkable kind, called the Federal Council. It
consists of deputies nominated by the various
governments of the Empire, Prussia having a
standing majority, and its duty is to represent
in the parliament of the Empire the particular
interests of the federated states which compose
it. Here, again, we see something essentially
different from what the House of Lords is, or
ought to be. In France, the parallel is somewhat closer. There is a Senate elected by the
people simply and solely to do the work of
legislation in coordination with the Chamber
of Deputies. But as England, Germany, and
America understand the term, the second
chamber of France is non-existent. It is, as
it were, a mirror of the lower chamber. French

legislation has two rooms in its House because
two are more fashionable than one, and not-as in the other countries mentioned-because
each is needed to represent one element in the
national system. Lastly, the parallel between
the French and English second chambers breaks
down completely when attention is drawn to
the wide difference between the relations of
Cabinet to Parliament in the two countries.

THE CABINET MAKES THE LAWS

The French chambers are to a large extent
the actual parents of French laws. In England, however, all important legislation originates in the Cabinet. This is not the theory,
but it is the fact, of constitutional practice.
The Cabinet is really a committee of the majority of the Commons; when it produces a
legislative proposal, everyone knows that unless
the sky should fall that proposal will pass
through Parliament into law. It will pass the
House of Commons because the majority there
will support the proposal of the Cabinet which
was appointed to serve its purposes and represent its policy and whose individual members
lead it in debate. This point is dwelt upon-this origination of legislation in the Cabinet,
this commission which the Cabinet holds to

represent and act for the majority of the Commons---because it materially affects the duties
which each house of Parliament is called on to
perform.

It has been charged against the House of
Lords that frequently it sits for a quarter of an
hour a day, and that it will dispose of half a
dozen intricate measures in half as many days.
Well would it be for English public life if the
House of Commons would sometimes do the
same. This speedy legislation means nothing
but that the Cabinet of the day has conceived,
framed, and drafted a measure so unobjectionable that criticism is wasted upon it. The
House of Commons, very likely, has discussed
it for five days without altering "more than a
word or two. The Lords, with Olympian
celerity, produce the same result in as many
minutes. This is not intended as a slur on the
representative chamber; what it is most im,
portant to make clear is that the business of
both Commons and Lords, of the Lords in an
especial degree, is not to legislate but to give
sanction or refusal to what the Cabinet each
year proposes. Only what the Cabinet proposes has the slightest chance of becoming law.
If the Lords, in an industrious access of legislative fervor, were to work for hours a day and
pass bills of heavenly wisdom morning, noon,
and night, not one of these would become law.
The Commons would never look at them.
Lack of time would cause them to perish, be,
cause the immense mass of Cabinet legislation
annually leaves the Commons no time to consider anything else.

Now it may be thought that the view here
taken of the English Constitution raises the
Cabinet to an unwarranted level of importance
and degrades the legislature into a mechanical
farce. It can only be answered that anyone
curious enough to come and watch the working
of politics in London will not be long in subscribing to the doctrine. And in the system
thus described, the House of Lords-the
chamber of youthful dukes and nonogenarian
barons, of dried-up lawyers and bishops in
lawn sleeves-plays its humble part with admirable fidelity. There is little asked of it by
the English Constitution, and that little it
performs with the dignity and speed and honesty of business men and gentlemen.

Let it be repeated, then, that the Lords in
normal timps, consist of a small number of very
distinguishiWhwn, making trifling but excellent
alterations in the legislative proposals of the
