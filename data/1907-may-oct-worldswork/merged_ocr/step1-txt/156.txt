to itself more attention than any other feature
of our commercial life. By the census of
1900, the total wealth of the country was
placed at 881,: billion dollars, of which vast
sum one-tenth was railroad property. After
deducting nine billions as railroad values,
there remained 79% billions as representing all
other interests. No other kind of property,
however, is so universally distributed over the
country as the railroad and none is more subject to discussion at all times, entering as it
does so vitally into the necessities of every
community; and when you ask what lines of

development I think of most importance, I
have no hesitation in saying that the lines of
development now most pressing are in respect
to additional track capacity and a better understanding between the railroads and the people.
As I have said on other occasions, the most
valuable and the most patriotic service a man
can render his country, particularly at this
time, is in assisting to establish a better
and more friendly understanding between the
people and the railroads, and cooperation between our governments, both state and national
and the managements of railroads.

THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE
SOUTH

BY

C. M. KEYS

T THE present time, the South and the
A Southwest lead all the other sections
of the United States in the number and
extent of railroad lines projected or under construction. The Railway A ge recently published
a very complete summary of the railroad
mileage under contract or under consideration
in the United States. For the purpose of this
article, the table published by this authority
may be rearranged, as follows:
MILEAGE CONTRACT OR CONSTRUCTION
New England States. t...... t 3
Middle Atlantic States 296
Central Northern States 1,000
Northwestern States "1,885
Pacific States _ _ _ 2,866
Southern States - -, ". 5,862
South Atlantic States. - 1,821
Gulf and Mississippi Valley. 1,755
Southwestern States. 2,286
Total - "11,912

From this summary, it appears that the Southern and Southwestern States are responsible
for about 49 per cent. of the entire railroad
mileage under contract or under construction
in the United States.

From the same authority, we learn that the
fifteen states generally included under the

term "Southern and Southwestern" gained
about 45 per cent. of the new railroad actually
built in the year 1906. This summary is
interesting. The results of it are given below,
by states:



Alabama.... 84 Mississippi -... 177
Arkansas... 244 North Carolina - 130
Florida..... 177 South Carolina.. 35
Georgia.. "". 189 Tennessee.... So
Ind. Ter. and Okla.. 162 Texas.... - 709
Kentucky.... 30 Virginia..... 132
Louisiana.... 391 West Virginia -. - 130
Maryland.... 9
South and Southwest.. 2,649
All other states -. 3,452
Total ". 6,101

The South appears to be at this time a
fertile field for railroad builders of the imaginative type. I remember investigating one of
these projects some three years ago. The
road was announced with a great flourish of
trumpets, in a Texas newspaper. The announcement named a "prominent financier
of New York" as the president. His name
was familiar in Wall Street. He was a Kerr.
tucky gentleman, famed for the stories that he
told if one found him late in the day.
