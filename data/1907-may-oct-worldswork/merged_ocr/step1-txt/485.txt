THE DIRECTION OF THE

in some sections of the country under certain
conditions and in other sections of the country
under other conditions. Fundamentally the
matter is the same: too small a value is put on
a human life. And this is yet a defect in our
American way of thinking and living.

A SHORT STEP ON A LONG JOURNEY

F THE facts about disease and its causes
and its transmission that have been
proved over and over again were known and
healed by the whole population, all contagious
and most infectious diseases might be banished
in a single generation. It is within the power
of any country or community, if all the people
would work together, to begin a wholly new
era in health and consequently in efficiency
and in happiness-to be more healthful and
robust than any large group of people has ever
been since the world began.

We are making progress in this direction,
greater progress, perhaps, than ever before.
But it is slow, at its swiftest. How discouragingly slow it is in comparison with what it
might be! For we are yet a long way from that
public and social opinion which will discredit
a man who becomes ill-regard him as a fool or
a criminal and untrustworthy. We have not
yet come into that state of mind which would
compel the swift and severe punishment of any
property-holder who has a place where mosquitoes may breed, or who keeps a stable or a house
that swarms with flies. Yet such persons are
worse public enemies, let us say, than petty
thieves or other kinds of criminals against
property whom we energetically punish. We
shall reach this state of mind some day.

In proof of such a prediction, consider a
recent action of the Merchants' Association of
New York, which is, of course, a body of very
practical men, who address themselves to very
practical tasks. The association solicited a
fund to investigate "the part played by flies in
carrying germs of intestinal diseases from the polluted waters about the city to the food supplies
exposed for sale." Nobody knows how many
deaths and how much suffering and how much
impaired efficiency are caused in this way. A
polluted pool or a neglected lot or an uncaredfor backyard on a farm or in a suburban
village has its germs of disease and its swarm
of flies. The flies carry the germs to the fruit
and the vegetables that are sold in the city and
eaten without cooking; and men, women, and
children contract diseases in mysterious ways.

Nobody punishes the culprit. Nobody knows
who the culprit is. We yet accept such diseases
as unavoidable incidents of life.

Society is only beginning to learn the extent
to which cooperation is necessary, especially
sanitary cooperation. For the smaller the
enemy, the more perfect must be the organization and the cooperation to guard against it.
To defeat flies and mosquitoes, to say nothing of
typhoid and tubercular enemies, requires a
more compact and "centralized" government
than we have yet accustomed ourselves to;
for we are still in that crude stage of political
and social cooperation where the chief work of
government is fighting human enemies.

THE DIRECTION OF THE GREATEST PROGRESS

HE direction in which the surest and most
helpful progress lies for the betterment

of mankind is not in politics nor in religious
faith nor in what is usually meant when we
say "education"---) is, the formal training
of youth in a conventional set of studies. The
most rapid and certain progress would be made
by the application to daily life of the scientific
knowledge that has been accumulated. Some
discoveries and inventions do find practical
application quickly and easily, such as electric
lighting, the telephone, the gas-engine, inoculation for diphtheria, and many more. Others,
and many very much simpler, remain unapplied or are slow in finding practical use. We
are beginning to apply the transmission of
power by the rapid development of hitherto
unused water-power. But we are yet very slow
about it. We are strangely slow, too, in applying electricity to many household uses. In
the great field of preserving health-preventive
medicine, we sometimes call it-we are criminally slow. The quack and the vendor of drugs,
even of unknown drugs, do as thriving a business as they ever did. In those tasks that
require more compact social and political
organization, such as the conquest of tuberculosis, the prevention of diseases conveyed
by milk and water, the extermination of mosquitoes and the like, we go forward hesitatingly.
The adoption of healthful methods of eating,
even the eating of less food in middle life, is a
slow process. Real health-resorts, or sanitaria-places where men and women may
learn before disease attacks them how to live
so as to avoid the ailments that a wrong system
of life will surely bring-ought to be within the
reach of everybody and ought to be so con
