deposits shows the marvelous increase of productive activity-from less than b millions in
1900 to more than 15 millions in 1906; and
the value of manufactured products from 15
millions to more than 25 millions. Within the
same period the number of pupils in the colleges and higher schools has increased from
5,200 to 7,100.

The city now claims 140,000 inhabitants.
The census of 1900 gave it 80,000. And the
location of Nashville is extraordinary in this--it is almost equidistant from Cincinnati,
Chicago, St. Louis, and again from Pensacola,
Mobile, and New Orleans.

THE FUTURE OF VIRGINIA

Virginia is not in the cotton belt and it has
not, therefore, shared directly in the increased
wealth that has come from the rise in the price
of cotton. But in all its chief cities-Norfolk,
Lynchburg, Petersburg, Richmond-ond in
many of the rural regions, the same sort of
advancement has taken place and is taking
place as in the cotton states.

Within twenty years, the average size of the
farms has been reduced from 400 to 200 acres
and the number increased from 75,000 to
160,000. Last year 2,400 farmers from other
states went to Virginia and invested ten
millions in farming. Stock-raising has had a
new impetus. It need not be said that the

valley of Virginia is, for agriculture as well as
for climate, one of the most attractive parts
of the continent. Nor need it be said to any
