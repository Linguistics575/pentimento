A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB

the Hampton boys would accept his decisions,
even though he were a colored man. I have
never had any occasion to believe my supposition incorrect. I have been most fortunate in
having as an able and loyal assistant one of the
boys who worked with me at the saw-mill,
Captain Allen Washington, who deserves an
equal share in any success that may have come
to the disciplinary part of Hampton Institute
during the past decade and a half. People
often wonder how the two races get along
together at Hampton. The truth of the
matter is that there has never been any manifestation of unpleasant relations between the
two. They have met on common ground,
each yielding to the other the respect due to
office and rank without regard to race or color.
Without doubt, the influence of each race upon
the other is good. The Indian has quite as
much pride in his race and ancestry as he
needs, and in this respect the Negro is lacking.
The Negro is accustomed to work and is
anxious to learn from the white man; the
Indian is unaccustomed to work, and is sometimes doubtful whether the white man's civilization is the best for him.

Not long after General Armstrong's death,
Mr. Frissell told me that he would like to have
me remain at Hampton and do what I could to
carry out the founder's wishes regarding Hampton's work for the Negro and Indian races.
I have continued my work along the same
general lines, giving perhaps more of my time
to administration and considerable of it to the
Northern campaign work, relieving Dr. Frissell and Dr. Turner, the chaplain, in some of
their efforts toward the raising of funds. I spent
two summers at the Harvard Summer School,
taking work in gymnastics under Dr. Sargent,
so that I could better help the boys in their
physical training.

In the summer of 1901 I was urged to take
a rest, and one of Hampton's trustees was so
kind as to give me an opportunity of visiting
many of the principal countries of Europe.
I had never felt so hopeful about my own
people as I have since this trip. It opened my
eyes to the hardships and disadvantages of
people in Europe and I feel sure that our
difficulties in America do not begin to compare
with those of the average European peasant,
who, as a rule, is not so hopeful as the most
benighted American Negro. This trip broadened my views in many ways and increased my

courage and hope for the future of my race. I
have ever since been strongly of the opinion
that I had rather be a Negro in America than
be anything else anywhere else.

As to my work at Hampton, I am not sure
that I would not have accomplished more elsewhere. Certainly, what has come to me in
association and contact with the pupils and
teachers of Hampton is far more valuable than
anything I have been able to give. I am truly
glad that I have been able in a small measure
to lighten some of the burdens that Dr. F rissell
is carrying. I do not believe that there is a
man in America to-day who has done more
than he to find a common platform upon which
Northerners and Southerners and Negroes can
work in harmony and mutual helpfulness. It
seems to me a shame that with the immense
wealth of America and with so many generous
people, men like General Armstrong and Dr.
Frissell and Dr. Washington should be obliged
to go from place to place asking for the necessary money to carry on the work of Hampton
and Tuskegee, expending the energy that
should go into the daily work of their schools.
I do not know of any man who is so able
to completely hide himself behind the cause
for which he labors as the Principal of Hampton Institute.

It is a great privilege to have shared in the
work of the institution that has done so much
for me and my people. A more earnest, competent, devoted corps of workers cannot be
found than the men and women, mostly of the
Anglo-Saxon race, who are working at Hampton Institute. I do not think of them merely
as teachers of ignorant Negro and Indian
pupils, but as patriotic citizens striving to fit
these black and red children to share in the
blessings and privileges of our civilization. I
doubt if one could find a more earnest lot of
pupils than are to be found at Hampton, eager
to grasp the instruction given in trades, in
agriculture, in academic studies, in religion
and morals in order to go out and help in an
unselfish way their less fortunate brothers.
For I truly believe that unless modern civilization is a failure and Christianity an eternal
mockery, all of the worthy elements of our
population, even these black human creatures,
will be permitted to share equally in all the
fruits of our country according as they measure
up to the standards and requirements of this
civilization.
