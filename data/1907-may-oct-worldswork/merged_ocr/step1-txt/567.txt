A NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN

$ 10,000 to the African Methodist Episcopal
Church. This was the origin of Wilberforce
College.

The community which has grown up about
it is composed of a few farmers, who have been
attracted to the place by the College; a few
former students, who, after succeeding elsewhere, have gone back there to make their
homes; the oflicers of the school, some sixty
families in all, and about 400 students. Of
the little colony of Negro refugees who settled
in this neighborhood before the war, them still
remain a few families. On a little height on
the edge of the town there still stands a modest
cottage in which lives the only one of the
early pioneers who still remains. The memories of others are preserved in the names of some
of their descendants who occupy farms in the
neighborhood.

THE TOWN'S UPLIFTING INFLUENCE

I have referred at some length to the earl _
history of Wilberforce, in order to emphasize
the permanence (I am almost tempted to write,
the antiquity) of the community, and to suggest something of the interest and attraction
that the place has come to have for those who
have grown up there. Permanence and stability are always important factors in the development of a people. They are, perhaps, more
important to the Negro race at the present
time than they are to any other element of the
population. The individual who grows up
without feeling himself a part of some permanent community, which exercises at once a
controlling and an inspiring influence upon
his life, is placed at a great disadvantage.
In the Negro communities like Wilberforce,
we may see, I believe, the growth of a moral
control within the Negro race, which is taking
.he place of the control that was formerly imposed upon it from without.

The influence of Wilberforce is reflected in
the character of its homes and of the people it
has gradually, in the course of years, drawn
about it. Idoubt whether there is any Negro
community in the United States in which there
is so large a number of beautiful and wellkept homes.

One of the most characteristic of these is
that of Professor William S. Scarborough,
Professor of Ancient Languages. Professor
Scarborough has been at Wilberforce for about
thirty years. He has made himself an authority in his studies. He is member of a number

9365

of learned societies, and is the author of a
text-book on the Greek language. He has
traveled widely in Europe, and his home is
filled with the fruits of his journeys. He has
an extensive library, and he and his wife, who
is the head of the Normal Training Department of the school, have devoted much time
to local history, particularly to the history of
Negro schools in Ohio. His home has the
refined, studious atmosphere of a scholar.

A WEALTHY NEGRO COLLEGE PROFESSOR

President Joshua H. Jones, whose home
directly adjoins that of Professor Scarborough,
is a different type of man-the modern type
of college president, an administrator and a
business man. He is an enthusiast in agriculture and, in addition to his work as teacher
and head cf the college, is an extensive
landowrocr. President Jones is, to a greater
C'gree than any other member of the community, a self-made man. He was born on a
plantation in South Carolina, and, until he
entered Claflin Univer' ity at nineteen, he had
a very imperfect education. He was for ten
years a student, first at Claflin University, in
South Carolina, later at Howard, and finally
at Wilberforce; during all this time he supported himself mainly b r teaching in the summer months. His school training fitted him
to be a minister. He got the training which
made him a busine .s man outside of the school,
and the story of how he obtained it is interesting.

"While I was in Lynn, Mass.," he said, "I
saved a few hundred dollars and put it in the
savings bank. Somehow or other some promoters who had come East for money for their
speculations learned of it. They wrote to me.
I replied courteously, asking for further information. Then they called on me, and outlined
their plans and projects. I listened to all they
had to say, attentively, and with great interest,
for they were introducing me into a new world.
But I did not give them my money. I continued to receive circulars, to which I always
replied. Evidently the promoters did not
understand me. Perhaps they thought just
because I always listened and inquired, that I
had more money to invest than I had. Anyway, this thing went on for years. After some
years I began to get reports from some of the
investments that had been offered mo, and l
was able to see the other side of the transaction.
All this time I was observing and studying.
I never put any money into any one of the
