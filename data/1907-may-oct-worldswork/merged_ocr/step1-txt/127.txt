HE present industrial awakening in the

I Southern States is the most important

economic event in our history since
the settlement of the West. Go where you will,
the people are building homes, schools, and
roads, and in the cities business buildings and
factories. "There is a crying need of more
houses in this town" headline like this
appears in most of the newspapers from
Virginia to Texas. The trains are crowded
with people. The railroads cannot haul the
freight. On one day lately, IDD freight trains
passed through the first capital of the Confederacy; and Montgomery is now a city of
beautiful homes and modern business methods.
The very streets of Mississippi River cities were
filled with cotton last spring, for there were
not enough boats and trains to move it. The
income from the very cabbage and lettuce fields
of South Carolina is greater than the revenue
of the state was when it seceded. There are
new hotels in most of the towns, and new and
old alike are crowded. Several Southern
States have commissioners of immigration in
Europe seeking men. Emigration has stopped,
and you may read in the newspapers of. the
Northwest advertisements for farmers to go
South, where fertile lands and good markets
await them.

A young man who inherited a farm in Georgia
left it ten years ago and went to Atlanta, thence
to New York. After a few years of successful
work in New York, he went back to Atlanta;
and now, after successful work in Atlanta, he
is going to return to the farm. He has made
every one of these moves along the line of the
greatest profit.

houses are replacing old and smaller ones.
Thousands of farmers who used to be in debt
now have cash in banks that did not exist five
years ago. The people are cheerful and they
look at life from a new angle.

The South has worked out three fundamental
tasks which all the world may profit by:

(r) How to teach the farmer who is now on
the land to double his crop;

(2) How to teach boys and girls practical
trades while they are "getting their education";

(3) How to govern cities without politics
and without graft.

Most of the old notions about the South and
the Southern people that have been held in the
North must now be revised; for every-day
events contradict the conclusions that were
drawn from facts of the past.

Most of the old notions likewise about the
South and the Southern people that were
formerly held by the Southern people themselves must now be revised; for every-day
events contradict the conclusions that they
also drew from the facts of the past. New
economic forces are at work.

It is these changes that are explained and
emphasized in this number of THE WORLD's
WORK, because there is nothing in our contemporaneous life more interesting or more
important than this rise of the people in these
states, eager to the task of their own development and of the development of this richest
region of the Union. This work has now been
begun with such vigor that it will go on indefinitely; for natural forces have come into
play and the land of "problems" has become

a land of progress.
