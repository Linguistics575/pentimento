THE PERIL OF JAPAN

and Rousseau became the staple diet of Japanese adolescence. There were no half-way
measures.

It was the same in finance, industry, trade,
and war. Western methods were not grafted
upon the old methods, but the old methods were
summarily thrown out of doors, and the new
were suddenly installed. The meteoric rise
of the army and the navy to Western "tandards
is a matter of marvel, but of common knowledge. The highly organized educational system, centring about great universities, is
coming to be understood in America. Four
years after the end of Feudalism, the Government quietly appropriated the National Banking Law of the United States, and made it the
National Banks Regulations of Japan. Within
eight years there were 153 national banks in
the Kingdom. By 1884, there had grown up
over 900 other banks, not under this law-very
like our trust companies and savings banks.
Japan therefore took another leaf from the
Book of the West, and made national laws to
regulate these banks properly-which is one
step farther than we have gone

The reckless, impetuous progress of the
nation has been seen in every department of
the national life. It was only in 1872 that the
first mercantile fleet under the Japanese flag
came into being. Growth was rapid and
sound, but it was not fast enough to satisfy
the Government. Therefore, in 1896, the Navigation Encouragement Law was passed, granting great subsidies to all ships over 1,000 tons.
To-day, the merchant fleet includes 1,500
steamers with a gross tonnage of over 1,000,000
tons, and the Japanese flag is flown on all the
great trade routes to Europe, America, Aur.
tralia, and Bombay. The growth has been
helped by large bounties paid to Japanese
builders, with the result that within the past
ten years have come into existence in Japan
art) private shipyards and 42 private docks.

The telegraph service of the Empire began
in 1869, but it did not amount to very much
until 1879, when the country joined the International Telegraph Union. To-day, the wires
measure over 95,000 miles, radiating from
2,600 offices. The telephone system of the
country is over 45,000 miles, based on 483
offices, of which 143 are automatic.

These things are nothing marvelous in
themselves. The marvel of them lies in the
swiftness with which they have come about.
There has been in Japan no slow broadening

down from precedent to precedent. Instead
they have, in the spirit of their edict, "searched
all lands for knowledge," and taken to themselves swiftly the best of everything they found.

JAPANESE CONDITIONS IN 1907

It is time to turn to the reverse of the picture.
In the Financial Annual for 1907, the Minister
of Finance undertakes to outline the economic
condition of the country. The spirit of the
comment may be gained from the following
phrases, gathered from the text:

"The year... closed in a state of unparalleled prosperity.. Enterprises also arose with unprecedented
briskness and the stock market was more active than it
had ever been hitherto. Consequently the prices of
securities rose higher and higher. Further, there
was a great increase in bank deposits and postal savings

and our foreign trade reached a remarkable degree
of prosperity. If we take the average of wages
at 100 in 1903, it remained from January, 1906, at 106 to
107: however, toward the end of 1906 it showed an upward
tendency. Meantime, the average cost of commodities, based on 100 in 1903, rose in November, 1906,
to I 19.1 I."

But the very report in which this statement is
given contains evidences that the price of
securities for a brief period may not be a fair
index of the economic condition of the people.

For instance, here is a pregnant paragraph:

"As the extraordinary special taxes were first imposed for
the purpose of obtaining revenue required to
meet the war expenses, they were to have been abolished at.
the end of the year following that in which peace was
restored; but the increase which took place as a result of
the war in pensions, annuities and debt charges
rendered unavoidable the continuance of these taxes

and accordingly the law relating to the taxes was
revised, and they became permanent."

The italics are not from the report. It is
timely to analyse those taxes, and the debt
which is responsible for them. The taxes,
of course, are based on the expenditure. In
the year that will end on March 31, 1908, the
government expenditure of Japan will reach a
total of $ 313,220,000, or about $ 6.40 per
inhabitant. Of this total, $ 83,000,000 goes
for interest on the debt, and more than
$ 97,000,000 for the army and the navy, not
including pensions.

It is well to digress here to point out a
very remarkable fact: In the year ending
March 31, 1908, the Japanese Government
will spend more money on its army and its
navy than it ever spent in a single year before.
