OUR RELATION

A SENTIMENTAL INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP AND AN AWAKENING

, I SHE tendency of the present day is to

classify; the general public insists
that nationalities be listed in its
primers as white or yellow or black-war-like

or peaceful, commercial or artistic. Time has
scarcely changed the old copybook axioms
which summed up the character of a people in
a few words of light up-strokes and heavy
downward ones-vie French are a gay
people, fond of dancing"; "the English are
gloomy and devoted to trade." To-day we
ask, in curiosity and alarm, "What are the
Japanese?" The answer might, at this moment, be given in these words: "The Japan
ese are a proud people upon whom we forced
our acquaintance, but to whom we are not at
home when they return the call."

Our relations with the Island Empire began
with such an appearance of good will on our
part that it is a little difficult for us to treat
these people as an accident now. We have
forgotten the blare of trumpets with which the
invasion of Japan was accompanied, the sounding phrases which told us-and the invaded--.
that here was a people sitting in darkness, to
whom we would bring a great light. Christian commercialism and commercial Christianity were the two forces which were to raise
a sunken nation to the light of day; commerce and evangelization were to dance, hand
in hand, over a reclaimed and grateful country,
ready to develop obediently and exclusively
along the lines of convenience and advantage
to its discoverers.

SELF-RESPECT DEGENERATING INTO CONCEIT

The Japanese are at present going through
the wholesome discipline of disillusionment and
the effect will be lasting and profound. The
truth is that America and Japan first drew
together on the strength of idealized qualities
which were superficial in both-gallant benevolence and disinterestedness on one side; plia
bility, chivalry, and romance on the other.
Such a union is like the marriage of two sentimental young people who have fallen in love
at first sight. There will be no lasting tie be,
tween them until their flimsy ideals are shattered and they can take stock of the really good
qualities existing in each, and agree to make
the best of their common heritage in that sadly
mixed material, humanity. And the fibre of
humanity is a web woven of many strands,
sometimes working out in strange patterns.
The colors which make such a brave show on
the right side are but slightly discernible on the
reverse. The fundamental threads of human
existence are self-preservation and self-respect,
and they must be evenly balanced. Character
is not built on emotions, and great nations are
not the offspring of enthusiasms.

Japan has suffered in the past from having
balanced ill between the claims of self-respect
and self-preservation. For two long centuries the nation worshipped little besides its
own pride. The exclusion of foreigners and
the prohibition of travel became a dogma of
self-sufficiency; the people took it to mean
that the Japanese were so immeasurably
superior to all other races that any commerce
with others meant degradation. Previous to
and during the seclusion of Japan, the opinions
of the lower classes counted for nothing; they
could claim few rights, except those of protection, from their feudal lords; and, to all
intents and purposes, the nobles and their
military followers constituted the nation. A
noble pride became the acknowledged motive
of action; it took many admirable shapes---it inspired valor, self-restraint, a horror of
ostentation, a simplicity of living, and a consideration for others which are still the distinguishing characteristics of the best Japanese.
But in time this great quality developed into a
monstrous Juggernaut to which life and all
that makes life worth living had to be sacrificed,
