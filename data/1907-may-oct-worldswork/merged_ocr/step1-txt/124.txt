became mutual, and--thanks to the alarmist
campaign-probably permanent. In that first
week of September, 1905, telegrams of the
most atrocious and sensational kind were
manufactured for and by the San Francisco
papers and worked round via Shanghai and
Manila. Investigation proved that they had
never passed through a Japanese telegraph
office. They were eagerly copied by all the
American journals. The editor of a leading
New York paper had, a few weeks earlier,
offered his columns to the Japanese authorities
for any matter which they might wish to lay
unofficially before the public. When the riots
occurred, it seemed as if there were at least one
powerful organ on which they could rely to
refute the falsehoods circulated in the press at
large, and a.cable, followed by a letter, was
despatched, explaining the real state of the
case. Neither was published. It was a small
incident but it will not be forgotten.

THE JAPANESE IN HAWAII

It will be a real misfortune to the United States
if Japanese labor be excluded from Hawaii.
While the islands constituted an independent
state, every inducement was held forth to Japanese emigrants to settle there, and the United
States, when it annexed them in 1898, continued the native policy in this particular. In
1902, four years after the annexation, out of a
total of 24,653 laborers on that rich soil, Japan
stood at the head of the list with 12,080 men;
the marked increase in the rice crop is chiefly
due to the Japanese, who introduced the cultivation of upland rice after their own methods.
Before their time, only swamp rice was grown
in the islands, and its culture was entirely
carried on by Chinese. At the end of 1903,
there were 68,740 Japanese residing in the
country; (50,341 males, 18,399 females). The
war' temporarily checked the influx, but during
the first year after its close, over 18,000 emigrants from Japan landed in the islands. The
numbers are now well above 100,000, and
emphatically have they justified the wisdom
of the United States Government in encourageing the movement. They have proved a real
benefit to the territory, and, what seems more
important in the eyes of their own people, they
are thoroughly happy and prosperous. They
represented, eleven years ago, nearly one-fourth
of the entire population, (24,407 out of 109,020);
this number has quadrupled, but we have still
to hear a single complaint against this large,

industrious, law-abiding community which is
taking American wages for hard work honestly
done. It is work which the people of our own
race cannot undertake, on account of the
climate, and certainly, as far as American
interests are concerned, it will be a great loss
if the labor exclusion act be enforced in Hawaii.

THE JAPANESE IN THE PHILIPPINES

Some nervousness was once shown regarding
the influx of Japanese traders and workers
into the Philippine Islands. Well-founded
assertions are powerless to allay nervousness
if it should ever reach the epidemic stage;
and I am in a position emphatically to deny the
rumor that Japan has nefarious designs on the
Philippines. It will not be the fault of Japan
if peace is ever broken. In the unthinkable
event of hostilities breaking out between Japan
and the United States, it is true that the Philippines might fall a prey to the nearby army
and navy whose headquarters are almost
within speaking distance of Manila. But
to one who has had the privilege of talking
intimately with the present leaders of Japan,
the mention of such a war seems as incongruous
as a divorce clause inserted in a marriage contract.

The sensational talk of some of the American
newspapers would put America in a ridiculous
and unworthy light before the world. It would
be regarded as weakness which would furnish
fine incitement to aggression did any intending aggressors exist. a

The best explanation of the raising of the
subject at all is offered in an editorial in the
Japan Mail of February 9th. The writer
(quoting the Japanese journals) says:

"We have now to abandon the delightful relations of
mutual trust that used to exist between Japan and the
United States, and the two friends hitherto so.well assured of each other's good intentions have to fall into line
with the common herd of nations whose motto is the strong
man armed keeping his house. The truth is that for
many years the United States and Japan lived in a kind of
diplomatic Utopia. The cause was plain. Neither of
the friends had become a world-power. Both, from their
high places of peaceful domestic development, looked out
calmly on the armor-clashing world around them. But
within a very brief space, both have stepped down into the
arena, and so they can no longer regard each other with
quiet eyes of trust and faith. The change was bound to

come. We may lament it, but we must bow to it."

But it is, of course, unnecessary to destroy
a mutual trust which has lived for fifty years.
