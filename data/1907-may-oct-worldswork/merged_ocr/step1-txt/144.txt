3,000,000,000 tons, or nearly one-third of the
nation's total. Of workable iron ore, the
South contains one and one-half times as much
as the famous Lake Superior district; and this
does not include the deep-lying Southern ores,
unworkable at present. But all ores must be
counted in any estimate of iron reserve.

On a basis of value of product, the South
furnishes more than two-seventh:, of our oil,
and more than one-sixth of our gas.

Of coal and iron we have figures for the
production of 1905. All the Southern States
but South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, and
Louisiana mine some coal; but of the iron all

TO THE SOUTH

of this the South supplies $ 10,000,000. Of
mineral chemical materials the South supplies
more than one-half, chiefly phosphate rock,
all of which is produced in Florida, Tennessee,
and South Carolina; and nearly one-third of
the mineral pigments. Of precious stones the
whole country produces only $ 325,000 worth,
with the South furnishing its fair share.

The latest figures available for all mineral
products are those of the Census for 1902.
These figures/compared with those of the
Census of 1890, give an indication of the development which is steadily going forward.

except a small fraction comes from the three
states of Alabama, Virginia, and Tennessee.
Between 1889 and 1902 the production of iron
nearly doubled, but in 1905 it was slightly
lower than in 1902. Coal, on the other hand,
made a prodigious increase. The total value
of the iron output in 1905 was not quite
$ 7,000,000. It seems altogether safe to say
that the South is now deriving $ 150,000,000 a
year gross from its mines and quarries.
Next to fuels and metallic ores in the list of
valuable mineral products come structural
materials, with an annual product for the
United States valued at about $ 100,000,000;

figures for 1890 and 1902 shows the rate of
this development:
