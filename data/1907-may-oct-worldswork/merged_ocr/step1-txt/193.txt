THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE

bought the site of an old foundry on the
Pacolet River and, on February 16, 1880,
wrote: "We will break dirt to-day." Now
there are more cotton-mill spindles turning
in Spartanburg County than in any place of
similar size in this country.

The second mill in that community was
organized under even harder conditions. Captain John H. Montgomery came back from
the war to his farm, twenty-one miles south
of Spartanburg, as his son described it, "broke."
After several years' work as farmer and merchant, Captain Montgomery bought a site for
a mill a little further down the Pacolet River.
People were even less inclined to believe in his
venture than in that of Mr. Converse. He
knew nothing about cotton mills, they said.
Nevertheless, he persevered. He finally sold
about half of his stock in the neighborhood,
and most of the rest to fertilizer manufacturers
in Baltimore. By 1882 the Pacolet Mill, as
he named it, was in operation. For fifteen years
its average profits were 25 per cent. a year on
its capitalization. It was so profitable that
two more mills, Pacolet No. 2 and No. 3, were
built near by. The same thing had happened
to Mr. Converse's mill and, twenty years after
it was built, there were three.

Not one of these mills was inside the city
limits of Spartanburg, but the money they had
set in circulation had helped the town. It had
grown to 5,000 inhabitants. The stores ceased
to have front porches and the loafers had disappeared with them. People began to pay
cash for what they bought. Men began to see
the possibilities of the future. Half a dozen
influential citizens got together in the office of
the First National Bank and decided that the
town needed a mill within its borders. That
meant that steam instead of water power
would have to be used. Many feared this
could not be successful, and to raise the money
the stock had to be sold on the installment
plan. The machinery of the old Ocean Mill
at Newburyport, Mass., was shipped down
and the Spartan Mill was started. That
machinery has long since been thrown on the
scrap heap but the Spartan Mill, many times
larger than it was, is'now paying a TO per cent.
dividend on a million-dollar capitalization.

Mills rose on all sides of the town. One
example is enough. Two or three miles from
the city limits is the Saxon Mill. The first
investment ever made by the president, Mr.
John A. Law, was for some of the installment

shares of the old Spartan Mill. There are
now in Spartanburg county 37 mills with
671,941 spindles and more than 19,000 looms.

THE PROSPERITY OF A FACTORY TOWN

That is how the smokestacks came to
Spartanburg. What they have done for Spartanburg is more remarkable. There are about
50,000 bales of cotton grown in Spartanburg
County. This used to be bought for mills in
England and other parts of the United States
and shipped away. With cotton selling at
ten cents a pound, the county would get
$ 2, 500,000 for its 50,000 bales. Now the mills
buy this cotton and manufacture it into cloth,
which is worth on an average about 25 cents a
pound. When shipped away from Spartanburg in this form, the county gets $ 7,2 50,000
for that same 50,000 bales of cotton. But the
mills manufacture about 200,000 bales of
cotton grown outside the county, and that
200,000 bales increases in value about
$ 19,000,000 from the time it comes into the
county until it is shipped away again. The
mills have made a direct increase in the county's
yearly income of about $ 23,750,000. The
farmers have been benefited by this
more than any other class. They.used to
sell cotton to the local merchants under the
ruinous credit system; now a bale of cotton is
seldom seen in Spartanburg. There is a mill
on every road leading into town and the mills
pay cash. Instead of paying interest to a
merchant for credit, the farmer puts his money
into the bank and draws interest himself. And
he gets more for his cotton, also, since the mills
pay a little higher than the market price for
local cotton because they do not have to pay
freight on it. Before. the mills came, the
farmers had practically no market for any
thing but cotton. The mill villages and the
town now need more food than the local
farmers can supply, so they can sell their food
products up to prices elsewhere, plus the
freight to Spartanburg. I heard a housekeeper complaining that "frying-size "chickens
used to cost only ten or twelve cents apiece,
while now they cost that much a pound.
The sheriff used to be busy foreclosing mortgages. Now the farmers have about $ 8,000,000
deposited in the banks in Spartanburg and there
are four farmers' banks in other parts of the
county. The mills are not wholly responsible
for this but they, more than any other contributing cause, helped the farmer from poverty
