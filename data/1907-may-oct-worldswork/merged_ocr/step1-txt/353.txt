THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT 9151

seem powerless to prevent the disturbances
of the interstate rates.

Such cases, which can be multiplied indefinitely, point to a conclusion that the Federal
regulation over rates should be widely extended.
I am far from being an enemy of the rights
of any state in the Union, but I do not understand that these rights give a state the right
to regulate rates nor to make regulations to
govern the movement of traffic between states.
Such an application of the Federal power over
corporations authorized to engage in handling
interstate traffic, either by Federal authority or
by direct supervision, should not take away any
of the power of the states over purely intrastate traffic. If the Interstate Commerce
Commissioners should establish a standard of
rates over the entire country, after using all
the information at their command and the
machinery of the Government to adjust and
establish a scale of rates that are fair and equitable, it-is not right that the power of the
various states, by their separate acts, can
break down the entire fabric of rates so fixed
by power granted by Congress. There is, however, no doubt that the state can regulate the
traffic of railroad, telephone, telegraph, water,
gas, or other like companies which are exclusively state institutions.

For instance, a railroad from Chicago to
East St. Louis which does not engage in handling interstate traffic is subject to the jurisdiction
of the state of Illinois, alone. When, however,
it engages in interstate traffic by interchanging
with other roads extending beyond the state
of Illinois it thereby becomes interstate, and its
situation under the law is entirely changed.
It has become subject to the whole body of
the Federal law relating to interstate common
carriers, and has removed itself from all state
laws governing the same subject. Thereafter,
the state of Illinois may not, under the guise of
a local law, reduce its interstate rates, but such
power resides only in the Federal Government.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMISSION

The scope of the Interstate Commerce Commission should be sufficiently broad, and, at a
time not far distant, full enforcement of the
law should be had. It will in time become
a necessity that the proper fulfilment of the
functions of the Government, in dealing with
this most important question affecting, as it
does, every industry, man, woman, and child

in the land, will require the creation of a new
Cabinet officer, whose department will be
charged with responsibility in matters pertaining to railroads and navigation; who,
through his position in the Cabinet, will enable
the Cabinet members to keep in touch with all
matters involving the movement of the commerce of the nation, both domestic and foreign.

As the laws multiply, the labor of enforcing
them, of judging affairs under them, of making
rulings and investigating charges, must also
multiply. The Commission, too, must continue
to grow strong, or the whole system of administration will be ineffective.

I believe that I have touched upon most of
the vital points that are at issue. In dealing with
them, I have but one policy. That is, that the
people and the railroads shall get together and
confer upon the matters that arise between
them, and that the Government shall be the
instrument to enforce the agreement that the
railroad and the people shall make between
themselves.

I do not believe that railroads should
enter into politics, and I look confidently for
the time when railroads will not be forced to
go to a state or Federal capital to save themselves from dangerous legislation. That time
will come when the people and the railroads
bring to the settlement of their differences
the same common sense that they bring to the
settlement of their private disagreements.

EMPLOYEES AND INVESTORS ASSOCIATED

The one and one-half million employees
of the railroads and the stockholders are closely
associated and their interests are identical.
You cannot injure one without affecting the
other. There is a total stock issue on railroads
of about $ 6,6 50,000,000, of which amount about
$ 4,150, ooo, ooo is dividend-paying stock, and
$ 500,000,000 is non-dividend-paying stock.
The stockholders receive annually about
$ 240,000,000 as dividends, which is 5.78 per
cent. on the total dividend-paying stock, and
but 3.6 per cent. on the total stock issue of the
railroads; while the employees receive annually,
in monthly installments, $ 840,000,000, which is
equal to a dividend of 12.6 per cent. on the total
railroad stock capitalization of $ 6,650, ooo, ooo.

An employee earning $ 900 on a railroad is
receiving an income equal to 5 per cent. on
$ 18,000, and has a stake in the property equal
to an investment of that amount in 5 per cent.
