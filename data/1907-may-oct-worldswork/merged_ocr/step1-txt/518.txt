the clatter of tongues, and the general pandemonium begins again, to go on without
cessation until the closing gong brings relief.

Then come a rush for surface cars, elevated
stations or subways, and a ride home in a car
that is packed to suffocation, hanging to a strap
and being pushed and squeezed and shoved
about by a throng of fellow passengers.

When she reaches her abiding place there
is barely time to wash hands and face and tidy
up disordered hair before dinner. Then when
dinner is over there is a skirt to clean, shoes to
brush, rubbers to wash, to-morrow':, clothes
to be laid out and put in order-and then it
is time for bed.

There is no time for pleasure in her life, no
time for the softer, sweeter, tenderer things
of womanhood. It is a life stripped of humanity, robbed of most that makes life beautiful,
and spent in one ceaseless, perpetual grindsimply to live.

Is it any wonder that some of the weaker
spirits sometimes weary of the monotony and
go the devious path that leads to case and ruin?
Is it any wonder that, starved for the pleasures
and amusements that are the right of youth,
they seek the pernicious Saturday night dances,
where they are sure to find light and life,
merriment and admiration? And yet it is a

fact that the proportion of saleswomen that
frequent public dances is comparatively
small. Close observation proves that most
shop-girls are serious, self-respecting young
women, who are obliged to earn their own
iiving and are working hard to rise in their
work, or to get out of it into something
better.

Among saleswomen in New York City, the
writer knows one girl who is studying law and
hopes to be admitted to the bar next fall, one
girl who is studying medicine, one who is taking
a course in English at night, expecting in
another year or two to enter the field of literature, one who works well into the wee sma'
hours of morning studying Latin and German,
hoping to teach in a few months, and one who
spends all her evenings at a business college,
fitting herself to enter an office.

In spite of the fact that the shop-girl has
little time, little strength, and little opportunity
for the development of her higher self, there
are those who are getting, and will continue to
get, a good deal out of life. There are many
among them, who, in spite of the difficulties
in the way of courtship, will become loved
wives and mothers, and there are many who
will become prosperous business women, and
do a creditable share in the world's work.

DR. EDWARD A. AYERS

ISS PRISCILLA PETERKIN had

Nf given a week-end entertainment to a

few friends, including an analytical

chemist from Boston. Here is an abstract
from his diary:

"We had a savory breakfast of home-made
sausage and buckwheat cakes. The coffee,
bought'ground,' had a fair degree of coffee
mixed with the chicory, peas, and cereal.
There was enough hog meat in the pure'homemade' sausage to give a certain pork flavor and
about one grain of benzoic acid in each pate.
I also detected saltpetre, which had been used
to freshen up the meat. Whether corn or

potato starch or stale biscuit had been used as
a'filler,' I had to leave in doubt.

"The buckwheat cakes looked nice and
brown, from their generous mixture with rye
and caramel. The baking powder had too
much alum, but it did its work-it raised the
cakes; the oleomargarine that came from the
grocer as'pure butter' looked golden rich, and
added one more grain of benzoic acid to my
portion. The pure maple syrup, with some
go per cent. of'golden drip' (commercial
glucose) upon the hot cakes, really tasted
more like maple than some I have had in the
Canadian maple camps. But there was an
