thunder storm came up. Just before it began
to rain I had gone out a little way from the
trail and peeled the bark from a couple of
small trees to cover over my camera and the
can of batteries, to keep them from getting wet.
The flash-pan was fitted with a loose cover
easily thrown off when the powder ignited.
Then I put on my rain-coat and crawled under
a thiek-limbed umbrella-like tree and waited
for the storm to pass. Right in the middle of

crouched on a limb, rolled himself into a small
ball with his nose resting between his feet, and

the timber. At every flash of lightning he
would make a dash for the nearest tree as if

be obliterated and that this bear would run
against the wire. But I was again doomed to
disappointment. When only six feet from the
wire, the brute stopped, slowly nosed his way
up to it, and stood for a few seconds with his
nose but a little way from it. He then became
so interested that he worked a little nearer,
and while he was trying to make out what it
was all about, there was a sudden flash that
immediately brought him up on his hind feet.
