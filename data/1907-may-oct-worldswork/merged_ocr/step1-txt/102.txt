above him is Dr. Castellani, with Mr. Daniels next, and next to him again is the Secretary, Mr. Michelli.

Dr. Sambon is second in the front row

into which the experimenters retired when the
insects came out to feed, and whence they did
not emerge until feeding time was over. At the
same time, they sent some of the infected
mosquitoes to London, and these successfully
conveyed malarial disease to two healthy individuals who volunteered to be bitten-Mr. P.
Thurburn Manson, son of Sir Patrick Manson,
and Mr. Warren, a laboratory assistant. The
following telegram, sent from the hut at Ostia
by Professor Grassi, an eminent Italian physician, indicates the importance attached to the
double experiment:

"Assembled in British experimental hut,
having witnessed perfect health experimenters
amidst malaria-stricken inhabitants. Italian
physicians congratulate Manson, who first formulated mosquito-malarial theory. Grassi."

It was Dr. G. C. Low, too, who showed for
the first time in what manner the blood-worm
responsible for an important group of tropical
diseases, represented by that hideous and disabling illness, elephantiasis, gains access to the
human body. Like the malaria parasite, it is
introduced by the proboscis of the female
mosquito. This discovery is in itself of sufficient importance to justify the existence of the
school many times over, since it indicates the
way of escape from a whole class of diseases
prevalent in hot climates, namely, the exter,
mination of the mosquito.

The wonderful thing is that these minute
parasites have it in their power to control

the destinies of millions of human beings. They
can, and do, reduce the population of whole
towns and villages. One of the illustrations
shows the trypanosome, one of the most recently
discovered of the parasites, in the blood corpuscles. Introduced into the human body through
the proboscis of its host-the tsetse fly--it
multiplies until the whole system is poisoned and
the patient dies of "sleeping sickness," perhaps
two years after being bitten. A royal commission has reported that the population of a small
village on the Congo was reduced from 3,000
to 300 through the ravages of sleeping sickness.
The extraordinary extent to which the disease
spread is attributed, by some authorities, to
the exaction of the hut tax, since in lieu of payment thousands of men go yearly to Entebbe
(where there is now a laboratory for investigations) and, while working for the Government, live in grass huts along the shore of the
lake where these insects abound.

At the present moment, the British Commissioner of Uganda is making vigorous efforts
to deal with "sleeping sickness," and all persons
suffering from the disease are being removed
from the fly-infected districts and placed in
settlements inland, where they are being treated
with atoxyl. An expenditure of some $ 6,000,
spread over three years, is estimated.

Four years ago, the English Foreign Office
instigated an expedition to Uganda to inquire
into the cause of this terrible illness, one of the
expeditioners being Dr. Castellani, a former
