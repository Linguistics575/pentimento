NATURE'S GIFTS

The forests are chie0y of two kinds: Southern
pine and "hardwoods"---) of various kinds,
poplar, hickory, beech, ash, gums, etc. The
southern pine forests originally stretched from
Virginia well into Texas, covering the coastal
plain in a belt from I So to 200 miles wide.
The core of the original interior hardwoods
forest, terribly depleted on the whole, yet still
magnificent in extent and often in quality also,
sweeps around and between the ridges of the
Appalachians from central Alabama and
Georgia to southern New York, yielding on
the higher elevations to a large intermixture
of hemlock, spruce, and balsam, with some
white pine, until a point is reached where, in
the southern Appalachians, spruce and balsam
monopolize the sleep slopes. The finest hair
wood timber left in the country, and the chief
source of present supply, is found in the South,
mainly in two bodies-the Appalachian forests
and the virgin hardwoods of Arkansas and the
bordering states to the south, west, and north.

The actual area of land under forest is not
definitely known. Estimates of the existing
timber supply vary widely, and should be
accepted with great caution. All together, the
South's forest products are probably now yielding a boss income of $ 300, 000, ooo-more
than any field crop except cotton, and approximately twice as much as is obtained from all
its mines and quarries. The following is a
careful estimate of present resources:

area of the United States.

A conservative estimate indicates that in
twenty years the present supply of Southern pine
will be practically exhausted-a fact of startling
significance when one thinks of the part that
this lumber plays in the economic and industrial
life of the East. To the South the prospect
is still more ominous, for it will mean the drying up of one of the great streams which swell
the present tide of business activity. Most

of the land which is being stripped can be put
to no profitable present use other than the

growing of timber.

SOUTHERN LAND VALUE

Except in Texas, there is practically no land
in the South which is not capable of economic
use. It is simply a question of time and growth
in population until the needs of man call'into
play all the latent earning power of the region.

Under present conditions, the land may be
roughly classed as follows:
ACRES
Agricultural land. - - 127,000,000
Swamp land potentially valuable for agriculture 30,000,000
Timber land other than drainable swamp.. 265,000,000
Brush, waste, and inferior Eastern pasture

land potentially valuable for timber 48,000,000
w estern grazing land (50111101111) 00,000,000
11000:: land... 15,000,000
Total l 515,000,000
This statement is only approximate; no

exact data to confirm such a classification exist.
The brush, waste, and interior pasture land
was formerly forested but is now producing
little or nothing of value.

At the present time, only a fraction of
the land in the South is under cultivation and
a still smaller fraction under improved cultivatlon.

The present use made of the farm land of the
South is partly shown by the acreage devoted to
each of the principal crops, and the annual
value of the crops raised. For 1905 these were:

This statement needs to be supplemented
by figures for the value of animals and animal
products sold. Unfortunately, no such figure,
exist for 1905. Some light is given by the
1900 Census figures, showing the products of
Southern farms classified as follows:

Crop products.. $ 941,499,721
Animal products - 361,405,455
Forest products of farms - 40,903,300

Farming in the South is profiting greatly by
the scientific work of the Department
of Agriculture in intensive cultivation. For
