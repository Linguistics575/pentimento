pueblo villages are covered with smooth adobe
plaster, identical in appearance with the more
durable veneer of the college buildings. The
dormitories are f1at-roofed, with broad porticoes
on each story. Sills, rafters, and pillars are of
roughly dressed pine logs, mortised and pinned
together after the fashion of the Indians. The
capitals of some of the wooden pillars are copied
from those of the old Sat Miguel church in
Santa Fe and the heavy wall buttresses are in
evidence. A prominent feature is the walled,
winding stairway outside, reminding one of the
steep and winding approaches to the modern
pueblos of Wolpi and Aroma. Long ladders,
a familiar sight in the Indian villages of Tales
and Laguna, lean against the buildings. On
the roof of each dormitory is an exact imitation
of an adobe Indian oven; this serves to cover a
reservoir whence water runs throucrh a novel

From the roofs of the buildings and from the
porticoes are magnificent views. For hundreds
of miles, in every direction, stretch valleys and
mesas and mountains. Fifteen or twenty
miles to the east apparently only four or five
miles, so clear is the air-rises the abrupt and
precipitous wall of the Sandie range, with its
hare red cliffs and battlements, whose color
effects at sunset are marvelous. A hundred
miles to the west, beyond the Rio Grande, looms
faintly the rugged outline of Mount Taylor.
Ninety miles to the north is seen the bare shoulder of the Jemez peak, 12,000 feet high, rising
grandly from the vast forests of the Jemez
Reserve. Southward are the Manzanos, the
San Andres; the jagged pinnacles of the
Ladrones, or Robber Mountains; the San Mateos, and the Magdalenas; and, melting into
the shimmering southern horizon, the summits
of the Organ Mountains, 200 miles toward
Mexico.

Two hundred feet beneath the University lies
the bustling, attractive city of Albuquerque,
with its 15,000 people. Beyond winds the Rio
Grande among its farms and gardens, its meadows and alfalfa ficslds, its tall poplars and
spreading eottonwoods. No more inspiring
prospect than that from these buildings could
be imagined.

On festive occasions, long strings of the crimson chile peppers are festooned around the
college buildings, just as the Indians hang them
to dry from the eaves of their dwellings. Here
and there are gleaming yellow pumpkins and
bright-colored Navajo blankets, while at night
the students gather for merry-making around
huge bonfires that blaze in the placita,
