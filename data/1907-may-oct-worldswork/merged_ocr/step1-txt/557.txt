A CAREER OF BIG TASKS



SECRETARY AND MRS. TAFT ON THEIR SUMMER VACATION AT MURRAY BAY, QUEBEC

litigant or possible litigant. There was a
Captain Stone, a .friend, connected with a
telephone company. Captain Stone was requested to render his bill for judge Taft's
private'phone. The bill did not appear, and
the Judge sent for it. He added a message
that if it was not forthcoming, he would be
compelled to have the'phone taken out of his
house. His attitude was the same toward

railroad passes. He never rode free except
on his own receivership roads.

judge Taft had the paradoxical faculty of
pleasing both sides. Mr. Frank O. Lowland,
clerk of the court, who has served under twentyfive judges or more, declares that he never heard
a lawyer grumble over one of his decisions.
