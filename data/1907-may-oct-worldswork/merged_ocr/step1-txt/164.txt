extending from Richmond, Va., to Montgomery,
Ala-is henceforth to be mainly a manufacturing instead of mainly an agricultural section.
As for North Carolina specifically, we have
already seen that from 1890 to 1900 it more
than doubled its output of manufactures, and
since 1900 its growth in manufacturing has
been four times as rapid as in the preceding
decade. And all this is simply the revival
of a former industry and not a new development. North Carolina was the third state to
engage in cotton manufacturing. In 1810 its
manufactures and those of the adjoining states
exceeded those of all six New England States
and of New York combined.

In the Appalachians, from Pittsburg to
Birmingham, the South has convenient supplies
of coal and iron and also great reserves of
forest wealth. No other state in the Union,
says the Secretary of Commerce and Labor,
"offers such a variety of woods, both hard and
soft," as North Carolina. It is said of the great
White Oak Mills just completed in Greens,
boro, the largest factory for the manufacture
of blue denims in America, that the difference
in labor cost resulting from the mere saving of
fuel to the operatives here as compared with
New England would afford such a margin of
profit as to make Northern competition unprofitable. And perhaps the greatest natural
resource of this Upland South is yet to be
named-the people themselves. They are of
the same stock as those who have won world,
acknowledged industrial supremacy for Old
England and New England, and here in the
South their hands have not lost their cunning.

In its primary stages, manufacturing has
naturally followed the lines of least resistance.
Cotton, tobacco, lumber-these it had at hand
and to these it first gave attention. In 1880,
of every 100 bales of North Carolina cotton
the state exported 93 and spun 7; it now exports 7 and spins 93-and but for the unusual
increase in the state's production of cotton, its
factories would already be calling on other
Southern States for raw material. Of manufactured tobacco, the output in ten years has
not merely doubled but trebled, and the output
of furniture has increased 1,000 per cent.

No longer content with merely supplying
the wants of our own people, North Carolina's
cotton trade with China is now so extensive
that America's diplomatic relations with the
Orient are of interest to the entire state;
North Carolina tobaccos are advertised on the

Ganges and the Nile; High Point invites the
Cuban minister to its annual banquet because
of its fast-growing trade with his island; in
Thomasville I saw a factory which ships
chairs to South Africa; the Panama Canal
Commission rejected offers from all the rest
of the world and bought its furniture from
Mebane. In Durham I talked with the president of the chamber of commerce, who has
just returned from a stay of several years in
Japan, representing a Durham industry; another friend for whom I asked is now building
up a foreign trade in cigarettes "on the road
to Mandalay."

FACTORIES WITH HOME CAPITAL

In nearly every instance, too, these industries
have been developed by home talent and home
capital, mainly by men of small means, acquiring further capital and skill with the growth of
business. Thomasville and High Point may be
taken as illustrations. Some years ago, a man
who had failed at another business started a
$ 3,500 chair factory in Thomasville. Three
years later one $ 500 stockholder refused $ 5,000
for his shares. Other factories sprang up, and
now the sun never sets but that Thomasville
has shipped a chair for every man, woman,
and child in the town. High Point was only
a straggling country village fifteen years ago,
when three young men invested $ 9,000 in
furniture manufacturing. To-day it ranks
next to Grand Rapids, Mich., in output of
furniture; it can furnish a house from cellar
to garret except the piano (it will make pianos
before the end of the year), and has just added
street-car and automobile making to its list of
new industries. In High Point, too, the
laborers are capitalists and the capitalists are
laborers; one-sixth of the laborers own stock
in the factories, and the city claims a larger
proportion of home owners than any other
place of equal population in the country. In
Gaston County, which grows less than 15,000
bales of cotton and spins 100,000, a considerable number of mills have been built up by
men who began as day laborers; and his
friends tell with pride that Mr. George A.
Gray-whose name has been given to a milliondollar mill and who is president of three others
---began work as a boy of eight sweeping factory
floors. In one small Piedmont town are
twenty-five men whose individual wealth must
be told with five figures, who formerly worked
