woman was doing full work again, but living
at the institution under the daily observation of
a physician. The patient should not return to
his home life until correct habits as to hours of
work, exercise, sleep, bathing, recreation, and
so on, have been worked out satisfactorily and
have become thoroughly established.

We individuals all differ; no two persons are
alike. Individual equations in each one of
these cases should be solved, and then habits
thoroughly established. It is not a thing that
can be done suddenly. It needs long observation on the part of a physician specially trained
for such work. It involves a consideration of
the mental states, the emotional states, the
methods of work, the temperament of the
individual, his education and experience, his
age, and his financial resources'.

This health education having once been
thoroughly done, there should not arise the

necessity for it to be done again. It should
mean a large increase of power throughout all
the subsequent life of the individual. If his
stomach is weak, he should discover how to
handle it most wisely. Has he a weak heart?
He should learn to work so as to get the most
out of himself with the least danger. Has he a
nervous system that is apt to play him false in
times of great pressure? He must learn how
to get the very best work out of this defective
piece of machinery, unless indeed it be possible to remove the cause within the nervous
system itself, so that the weakness no longer
exists and he shall not, therefore, be obliged
to look after it.

To know one's limitations is the first step to
success. To know how far one can venture
with safety is to be able to charge right up to
the danger line with the confidence and audacity
that win out.

A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES

MOUND BAYOU, MISS., AN EXAMPLE OF THRIFT AND SELF-GOVERNMENT

counties of Mississippi for two reasons:
it contains the richest soil in the famous
Yazoo Delta, and it possesses the only regularly
constituted Negro town in the Southern States.
This town, called Mound Bayou, gets its name
from a large mound, a relic of the prehistoric
inhabitants of the country, which marks the
junction of two of the numerous bayous that
make so important a part of the natural drainage system of this low and level land.
Situated in the heart of the wide alluvial
plain between the Mississippi and the Yazoo
Rivers, Mound Bayou is the centre of a Negro
population more dense than can be found anywhere else outside of Africa. The Negroes outnumber the whites seven to one throughout
the Delta. There are whole sections of these
rich bottom-lands where no white man lives.
Mound Bayou and the territory for several
miles around it on every side is one such section
-a Negro colony, occupying 30,000 acres, all
of which is owned by Negroes, most of them
small farmers who till 40 and 80-acre tracts.

B OLIVAR COUNTY is noted among the

The town itself has, at present, a population of
about 500. Of these, eightrthree are registered voters.

Mound Bayou is a self-governing community.
That is one of the interesting things about it.
It has had, since it was incorporated in 1898,
a mayor, three aldermen, a constable, and a
town marshal, all of them Negroes. This was
necessarily so, because no white man has ever
lived in this community since it was established,
except the man who introduced the telephone
system, ahd he remained only long enough
to teach some of the townspeople how to
manage the exchange.

The colony, of which Mound Bayou is, so
to speak, the capital, grew out of a correspondence and an interview between Maj. George
W. McGinnis, land commissioner of what was
known at that time as the Louisville, New
Orleans, and Texas Railway, and Isaiah T.
Montgomery, the man who founded the colony. The railroad, now known as the Yazoo
and Mississippi Valley, wanted to settle the
vacant lands along its right-of-way. It was
