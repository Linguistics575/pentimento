THE DANGER SPOT OF EUROPE 9243

was told there had been no massacres this
year, and that the country was quiet. I went,
and found the very reverse to be the truth.
I had traveled all through the Balkan States
merely to learn the truth, and I could not
miss Macedonia.

The result of this observation throughout
Macedonia may be briclly stated. T here will

and Ochrida I traveled, at first under Turkish
escort; not being permitted to see what I
wanted, I was allowed by l Bulgarian band to
join them, and I rode through these various
districts. I traveled quickly, wishing to get
out of the country. Its terrors had affected my
nerves, and the gloomy warnings of my friends
kept rising in my mind.
