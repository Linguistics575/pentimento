recommendation result in making obsolete the
time-worn phrase "national honor," so frequently used as a cloak for greed and bullying,

real service.

The next Conference is to be held not later
than 1914, if the proposal of the American
delegation be adopted. In the meantime, we
shall see the establishment of the International
High Court of Justice, which will be the most
august judicial body in the world. According
to the present plan, this Court will consist of
fifteen judges-mine from Europe, four from
America, and two from Asia. It will be a
court of appeal from the decisions of all commissions that have to do with international
disputes. This Supreme Court of the World
will be the achievement of Mr. Choate, whose
addresses not only made him a commanding
person in the Conference, but really led to the
adoption of the proposition.

The opposition to this tribunal comes from
the nations that are not Powers-chiefly from
the Latin-American states, whose sense of
proportion needs readjustment. It is a regrettable fact that some of the Latin-American
delegates have taken their admission to the
Conference too seriously. They have shown
a disposition to estimate their importance to
.the world's peace by their indi1idual titles
and medals, rather than by the relative
standing of their respective countries-Venezuela would rank with Germany, or higher!
This is, unfortunately, a matter of temperament.

As a matter of fact, these small republics
were probably invited to the Conference somewhat in the same spirit that the eldest sons of
English peers are given access to the House of
Lords-that they may serve an apprenticeship
in international affairs. It was not expected
that a forty-first-rate nation would insist upon
representation equal to that of a first-rate
Power.

This racial characteristic is further shown
in the plans for a Central-American Peace
Conference, to be held in Washington early in
the coming year. The five Central-American
states have agreed to submit their quarrels to
the joint-umpireship of the United States and
Mexico, that an end may be brought to the

senseless revolutions that have long blocked
the road to prosperity.

But the significant announcement is also
made that none of the diplomatic representatives of these republics that are now at Washington will be members of the Conference-on
account of petty jealousies that exist. The one
great need of the countries to the south of us is
a generation of men of larger calibre-states.
men to replace the excitable little ofcc-seckers
with their pompous titles and their fondness for
epaulettes.

But, in spite of all that the nations have not
agreed upon, we are on the high road to peace.
The Great Powers have come closer together
the nations that have Dreadnoughts, and
torpedo flotillas, and explosives against which
there is no human protection. The Powers
that really hold the world's peace in their hands,
and that police the high seas and the semicivilized lands, have had no serious disagreement on the main subject that brought the
Conference together. War has not been abolished, and will not be. Men have not wholly
ceased to knock each other down under great
provocation, though we have excellent statutes
and a strong public sentiment against it. And
nations are only men in mass.

But public opinion-the real peace-compelling power anywhere-is stronger for peace
than it ever has been in human history.

An equally surprising increase would doubtless

This increase in the number of travelers is a

Every year the number who can afford such

The swelling tide of travel shows also an everincreasing intellectual curiosity. A trip to
