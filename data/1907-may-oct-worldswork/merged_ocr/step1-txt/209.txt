A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

bigger and better offices, you find a staff of
men and women at work who are ready to
show you hundreds of photographs of ramshackle old schoolhouse that have bun
abandoned and of handsome new ones that
have been built to take their places. They
will show you photographs of children plantirg

an enormous increase of expenditure and
great pride in the schools. They will tell you
of traveling libraries; they will explain how
pictures have been put up in the schoolhouse.

In the colleges you find that the men who
teach spent their last vacations either abroad,
or at some university centre in the United
States. They no longer speak a local language.

Now it is conducted with reference to all the
others, and with reference to the secondary
schools. The annual conferences for education
in the South have been both cause and effect
of this change. An enthusiasm for cooperation
