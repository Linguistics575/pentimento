by year so gradually that we are likely to forget
it -that the products of the tropics are already
becoming more abundant and cheaper for the
enrichment o' the life of all Northern peoples.
The curious may find much entertainment in
comparing the total use of tropical products in
' civilized" countries now and ten, twenty,
and fifty years ago. The increase will be a
surprise.

THE CONFLICT WITH ASIA

UT of the anarchy from which San Francisco suffers comes one annoyance to the
Japanese after another-too little perhaps to
deserve notice under normal conditions. But
the Japanese jingoes notice even a reported
prohibition of Japanese employment agencies
by the San Francisco'authorities; and one of
their newspapers, an organ of the Opposition,
publishes a sort of demand for an international
inquiry. In the Hawaiian Islands, a meeting
of Japanese "demands" the admission of
Japanese laborers to the United States-contrary to the terms of our treaty.

These are triding incidents. Neither the
Government at Washington nor the Government at Tokyo pays heed to them; and there
is no strain on their good relations. But the
people of Japan, or some of them, are sensitive;
and their trade organizations have addressed
a polite letter of protest to President Roosevelt
and to American Boards of Trade. In a word,
if San Francisco and the United States wish to
continue cordial trade relations these annoying
incidents, however insignificant, must cease.

Japan has no thought of war, no wish for
war, no financial ability to wage war; nor has
the Government of Japan shown, so far as
the public knows, any irritation. Yet the
sensational press of both countries and even
some of the sensational newspapers of Europe
keep the subject of a possible breach between
the United States and Japan under discussion;
and irresponsible agitators in California and
Opposition politicians in Japan continue to
give occasion for news-items and discussion.

And the reason lies deeper than mere sensational news-getting. The persistent, if dormant, race-feeling blindly asserts itself; and
along with this the white man's fear that the
yellow man will yet get the mastery of much
of the world's trade-the fear that by cheap
labor and cheap living he will yet utilize the
modern mechanism of manufacture and commerce to the exclusion of the white races.

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

There is a race conflict and an economic
conflict between Asia and the rest of the world
-so, at least, a large section of Western opinion
fears. This is the large world-fact that must
be faced at last by statesmen of all continents.
To grant that such a situation must lead to
troublesome trade conflicts, to say nothing of
possible war at some time, would be to discredit in advance the wisdom and the justice of
governments and the enlightenment of civilized
peoples. For the closer contact of these races
ought to develop increasing mutual respect
and helpfulness. But the sense of a serious
problem rests on many minds, and already
there is growing up a considerable literature
that has the tone of the following prediction:

"Old ideas of Asia must be modified to-day.

One is still apt to cherish the belief that P beneficent
Providence has placed the white nations forever in an
economic position which can never be seriously assailed
But there are already apparent the beginnings of a renewal
of the old struggle between the West and the East. Only
it is assuming a new form.

"The real Asiatic peril is the acquisition by commercial
pressure and trade treaties of the right of entry to lands
now closed. It will be a repetition, less brutal and probably slower and more subtle, of the policy of Europe toward
Asia in the Nineteenth Century. The cloud to-day is no
bigger than a man's hand. In a generation it may darken
the whole political horizon."

This is the writing of an Englishman, not of
a Californian agitator; for it is taken from
Mr. L. E. Neame's book on "The Asiatic
Danger in the Colonies." He goes on to say:

"The Englishman who has never lived in Asia, or in
a country in which there has been a considerable influx
of Asiatics, does not grasp two things. It is not easy to
convince him that the Asiatic inevitably underlives and
undersells the white man. It is not less difficult to make
him understand that Asiatic immigration cannot be classed
with any other. It differs essentially from'the lowest
class of European immigration. The masses of Southern
and Southeastern Europeans who have entered the United
States will in time be absorbed in the population. The
process may take a varying length of time'with different
nationalities; but in the end there will emerge the American
people, even if their natural character becomes modified
by infusion of alien blood. But no white race can absorb
the Asiatic. The Eastern peoples always remain apart.
You can never get rid of what Meredith Townsend called
'the dull, unconquerable, unmitigable, distaste of Asiatics
for white mem' It is not unreciprocated. Deep down
beneath the strongest ideas of theoretical justice and the
desire to admit no prejudice there is a similar barrier."

The best safeguard against the realization
of these large, vague fears is statesmanship
of the type and temper shown by Secretary
