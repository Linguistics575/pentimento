IS THE DOCTOR A SHYLOCK? 8895

I called him once to come in haste to a laboring
man whose ankle had been badly crushed; it
was a protracted case and upon the surgeon's
skill depended the man's ability to support his
family. The charge for all services was $ 25.

Dr. C. is an older surgeon, and there is none
in his city who outranks him. Before me lies
the record of his first TOO operations for appendicitis, read to a small group of surgeons the
evening after the last operation. Every man
in the room sat straight up when he began to
read it, for it was well known that his operations
had been the most desperate of all. "Forlorn
hopes," upon which other surgeons refused
to operate, sent for Dr. C. If there appeared
one chance in ten to save life, the surgeon took
reputation in his teeth and went in. His
colleagues accused him of occasionally operating
after death! His remarkable success with
these cases does not concern this article so
much as his compensation. For no operation
out of the hundred did he receive more than
$ 1,000; the average was $ 100.

SPECIALISTS AND GENERAL PRACTITIONERS

In this representative city are eight "successful" specialists in diseases of the eye, ear,
nose, and throat. Their annual incomes are
about as follows:

2 make from $ 12,000 to $ 15,000
3 make from 10,000 to I 2,000
3 make from 3,000 to 6,000

Besides the foregoing, there are probably not
more than two or three specialists in other lines
who receive as much as $ 10,000 a year.

Of the general practitioners, there are probably fifteen in the upper ranks-men of
excellent reputations, prominent in medical
societies, most of them professors in medical
colleges. A fair estimate of their yearly in-.
comes is the following:

3 or 4 range above
4 or 5 range from 8,000 to $ 10,000
6 or 8 range from 4,000 to 8,000
General average of the fifteen: 8,000

510,000 a year

What do they do to earn it? They are in
their carriages so constantly that it is difficult
to keep office hours, rarely possible to leave the
city for a few days, and impossible to take a
vacation without serious loss. To gain an
income of this size, they do much more than
ordinary day-and-night medical work. Most
of them are also insurance examiners and
physicians to institutions; many of them lecture

$ 10,000 a year

to students more hours than the average college
professor, and also spend many hours each
week in clinics and laboratories.

With regard to fees, I systematized the
accounts of one of these general practitioners
and kept his books for two years. His practice
is large and wealthy, and his standing is such
that when he rises in a medical society to discuss
a case, all others sit down. His scale of prices,
which rarely varied, was fixed in this way: day
visits, $ 2 or $ 3; night visits, $ 5; office consultation, $ 31 or $ 2; consultation with other
physicians in serious cases, $ 5 or $ 10; special
examinations, $ 5 to $ 2 s. His bills were
rendered all the way from three months to a
year after the service, according to the patient's
circumstances. The only instances I can recall
when payment was insisted upon were cases
where well-to-do patients were in flagrant
default. At the end of every month, the number of calls I was instructed not to transfer to
the ledger was surprisingly large; they were
profit and loss. Medical service to students
and to institutions was not recorded, even on
his daily memorandum. "At least half of
our work is never paid for," he said one day
'u-except in thanks or the reverse."

Yet this man, like most of his colleagues
throughout the country, is stamped as a Shylock
by the easy writer who feels the sting of a recent bill for medical attention.

All these whose incomes are given fall within
the 20 per cent. doing the bulk of the business.
Of the remaining 80 per cent, one thoroughly
competent to judge says that the young doctor
probably makes from $ 500 to $ 1,000 a year
during his first five years of practice. After
his business is established, his average should
be about $ 1,800, gross. Another places the
average income for the entire country at $ 1,000;
he thinks 80 per cent. collect less than $ 3,000
a year.

THE COUNTRY DOCTOR

The income of the doctor in the small town,
if his practice be established, will range from
$ 750 to $ 51,250 a year. A Western physician
made the statement last year that careful inquiry made by him in nine different states had
shown that the charges of physicians had not
increased one cent in twenty-five years, though
the incomes of the people had more than
doubled. The schedule for four states was
about as follows: Day visit in town, $ 1; office
consultation, 50 cents; country visits, 50 cents
