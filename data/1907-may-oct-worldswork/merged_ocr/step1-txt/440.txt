where commercial methods would have realized
nothing. Treasury money had been deposited
with the explicit understanding that the note
of So-and-So, politician, was to be discounted out of the deposit, without any useless
fuss about security. This discovery aroused
the public indignation to the point of electing
William H. Berry, a Democrat, to the office
of state Treasurer in that fall's election; owing
no allegiance to the machine, he was under no
obligation to conceal what he should find.
The people had secured an accounting at last.

When the state capitol was burned, in 1897,
with it burned fine libraries and any amount
of state records. It was openly charged that
the building had been fired by the Quay
machine in order to destroy compromising
evidence. The story found credence, but was
never carried to proof. It is certain that the
state lost its records. The State Board of
Public Grounds and Buildings, consisting of
Governor Daniel H. Hastings, Treasurer Benjamin J. Haywood, and Auditor-General Amos
H. Mylin, with their executive officer, John C.
Delaney, the Superintendent, at once rented
and fitted up a church for temporary use.

THE FIRST CAPITOL COMMISSION

There was a strong anti-Quay feeling among
the Representatives, and the members did not
feel like throwing open the treasury doors to
that crowd to build a new capitol. And yet
a new capitol must be built. On April 14th,
a measure was passed that authorized a Commission for that purpose and appropriated
$ 550,000, with specific instructions that the
Commission was not to go into debt and that
it was to complete the building ready for
occupancy in time for the session of 1899.
The Commission consisted of the Grounds and
Buildings Board and the presiding officers
of the two legislative houses. And so Delaney
became its executive officer. Henry Ives Cobb,
of New York, was selected as architect, and
the Commission began its work.

Quay's term as United States Senator was
drawing to a close, and the state campaign of
1898 turned on his re-election. The fight was
bitter. Quay carried the state ticket but lost
a majority of the legislature. By thirteen
votes, he failed of succeeding himself as Senator. It was to a body of this condition of
mind that the Capitol Commission reported.
The half-million appropriation had been tied
up by its predecessor as tightly as words could

tie it, making it plain that the money granted
was to be all that was to be used, and that
there was to be a finished capitol.

When the legislature convened in 1899, there
was a curious spectacle on Capitol Hill. The
Commission reported that the capitol was
finished, and that it had been done within the
appropriation. There was a vast barracks of
red brick, walls raw within and without, with a
hole in the roof for a dome, covered over with
rough boards to keep the rain out. The legislative chambers had been hung with burlap,
and a tawdry covering of paint and whitewash
and gilding was spread on them. It was the
mere brick skeleton of a vast and pretentious
edifice; and that the Commission intended
this was shown early in the session by its
request for another appropriation-which it
did not get.

THE SECOND CAPITOL COMMISSION

By the time the election of 1900 came around,
the machine had recovered its grip on the state.
Accordingly a new appropriation of $ 4,000,000
was made and a new Commission was charged
with the expenditure on virtually the old terms
-that the work was to be done within the
appropriation. This Commission was headed
by the new Governor, William A. Stone; the
other four members were William H. Graham,
Member of Congress from Pittsburg; William
P. Snyder, State Senator from Chester County;
Nathan C. Schaeffer, Superintendent of Public
Instruction, of Lancaster; and Edward Bailey,
a wealthy and respectable bank president of
Harrisburg. T. L. Eyre, of Chester County,
Senator Snyder's colleague in running the
home county political machine, was chosen
superintendent of the work. By appointment
of the Governor, he held the position of Superintendent of Public Grounds and Buildings.

In the fall of 1902, Samuel W. Pennypacker
was elected Governor and took Stone's place
on the Commission. At the same election,
William P. Snyder was elected AuditorGeneral, and so became entitled to pass on all
the bills of the Capitol Commission, of which
he was a member. A competition of designs
for the new building was advertised, but the
method created such unfavorable sentiment
among architects that it was a failure. A
second attempt resulted in the selection of
Mr. Joseph M. Huston. Architect Cobb didn't
find favor, but his design for the brick barracks
made a perfect foundation for Huston's later
