9048 THE MARCH
had been made four or five years ago of
the condition and of the conduct of all the
companies doing business in the United States,
and if a similar examination could be made
now, there is little doubt that a very great
improvement would be discovered. The rights
of stockholders are more carefully considered.
Not long ago the counsel of a private corporation in New York was preparing a tax statement, and the officers of the company said to
him: "Prepare it exactly as if you knew that
the company would be examined next week as
the insurance companies were, or as if an
inquiry were to be made by the Department
of Commerce and Labor." The eouble standard of conduct-one standard for private
affairs and another for corporate affairs is
less common than it was.

Every act or tendency or awakening that
makes for honesty and for fair dealing directly
adds to the stability of values, to the security
of investments, and to financial confidence.
These forces are far stronger for stability than
the rhetorical alarm in financial circles is for
panic. Moreover, the checking, by imy lcgitimate force, of the ambitions of great financial
consolidators has itself added to prosperity
and security.

The agitation and activity touching the
regulation of corporations have then, on the
whole, in spite of some overzealous and mischievous activity, been a constructive and
conservative and upbuilding influence.

THE OUTSIDE CRITIC OF THE RAILROAD

ANY books have been published of late
with a view to the elucidation of the
railroad problem. The authors of these books
are not railroad men, but are generally students
who have devoted much time and labor to the
study of the railroad business. They know
the theoretical side of the problem much better
than the railroad presidents know it, and they
all have a smattering of the practical side.
They have failed to settle the problem; they
have failed, indeed, even to define it. Most
of them have made it clear that a problem
exists, but that has been an axiom for many
years. The reason why none of the bulky
volumes published on the subject has really
accomplished much is that they have not
brought practical advice to a practicaltask.
They have undertaken to build a ship by
merely making sketch-drawings of what a
ship should be,

Ob' EV CNTS

In the office of a railroad president, one hears
very little of these writers or of their books.
The chance remarks of men like Messrs. Ripley, Finley, Kruttschnitt, Winchell, and the
other men who really operate railroads will
all be found on file; but the critical books
are not in sight. The reason is that the worldold antagonism between the theorist and the
practical man is just as much alive as it ever
was.

The railroad heads are working hard to find
a solution of the problems that confront them;
but they are not willing to adopt any Utopian
dream that comes along. They hear of abuses
in their railroads, and they remedy the abuses
by calling into conference the men under
whose immediate command the abuses occur.
Discipline grows strict, and responsibility is
piled upon the agents, managers, and superintendents. The first result of the agitation
has been the strengthening of the railroad
discipline, and the promulgation of a new code
that makes it a grave offense to be accused
by the patrons or the newspapers.

The patrons of the railroad are looming
much larger in the view of the manager than
they loomed a year ago. It was the habit to
run the railroad for the big shippers, and let
the general public do business with it if it
pleased. To-day the general public comes
first. This is a long step in the right direction.
Other steps are to follow, as the railroad
heads can work them out. They must be
urged to new efforts-and in this respect the
"outside critic" performs a useful service.
THE REGENERATION OF THE RAILROADS

HE year has seen the beginning of a new

era in the administration of American
railroad corporations. It has been a year of
persistent agitation, of the constant turning
over and over of a great principle, the principle
that the people are greater than any private
organization of capital.

The result comes slowly to light. In the
end, it will give us a new school of financiers,
following the gradual disappearance of those
m ignates who stand for autocracy and for the
obsolescent, cynical code of corporation ethics
that has been the conventional thing in administration for the last ten years. This old
order changes, yielding stubbornly, it is true,
but surely.

There has never before been an era in American finance and public policy when the voice
