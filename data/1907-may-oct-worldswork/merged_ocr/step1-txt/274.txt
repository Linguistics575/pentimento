GORDON MEMORIAL COLLEGE AT KHARTUhl

Kitchener's rerapture of the Mah%'s stronghold, where "Chincse"
Gordon met his tragic death, was the signal for a popular subscription
in England to establish a great native training school as a memorial

hopelessly wrecked. Popular education, the
arts, the sciences, were unknown. Tcwlik
was surrounded by an official class made up of
the most unscrupulous seoundrels that ever
cursed a helpless people. T cwfik periodically
caught "the men higher up" by the heels and
shook them until the pockets of their capacious
bloomers were emptied of coin; the "men
higher up" then exercised the men lower
down in the same way. The lowest-of-alldown, the fellaheen, had no coin, but the taxgathers were skilled to the point of extracting
blood from a turnip. They did not come
down upon the peasant at the time of harvest
and carry away his crop; that was an old,
unscientific practice. They came while his
crop was growing. If he could not procure
actual money, they beat him; at their next
visit, he had the choice of the frying-pan or the

Shylock of Shakespeare was a philanthropic
gentleman in comparison with either.
Starvation and slavery stared every working
man in the face-and a more shameful fate
waited at the door of every young girl. Emaciated, naked, filthy, the lower classes huddled
together in wretched huts, along with their
few bony goats and chickens and Curr-a
conglomerate mass of dirt and vermin, the
absolute picture of wretchedness and disease.

KHARTUM FROM THE PALACE

The contrast in size and dignity between the Government houses
and the houses of the governed illustrates the English trait of
magnifying the majesty of the law in the eyes of the natives

There was scarcely a semblance of the human
left in them: there was less of the human in
their oppressors. Simple justice and "a square
deal" were dreams as remote as the Paradise
of Mohammed.

Major Baring knew all these distressing
facts, and more, when he took up his work
at the beginning of 1884. He knew also that
the task of cleaning up the land was not the
worst of it. There was a Parliament across
the water that might stop him at any moment;
there was a concert of fifteen Powers whose
consent must often be obtained before important steps could be taken; there were European
