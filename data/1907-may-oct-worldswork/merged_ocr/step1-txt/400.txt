restlessness, shown in muscular movements.
Many times, he says, he has sat in a position
where he could watch an audience as it listened
to some long scientific memoir. He took notes
of how people acted under the strain of protracted attention-how often they moved.
At the beginning of the hour they would sit
quietly; then they would begin to move on the
average of once every four seconds, then
every three seconds; and he says that it is
possible to trace right through any audience
every degree of fatigue by the number of muscular movements made.

He has simply put together mathematically
some data that are familiar to all of us. We
have, all seen-and, alas, been a part of-an
audience that was trying to endure the last
half hour of an unendurable speech. Everybody was shifting his position, crossing one
leg over the other or back again, moving the
fingers, playing with watch-charms or chains,
yawning, twitching, folding programmes,
wiping eyeglasses, adjusting back-hair, twisting mustache. Those were all fatigue signs.

A loss of self-control in small things: that's
the symptom in different terms; and another
name for it is irritability.

At first, it seems strange that this undue
sensitiveness to slight stimuli should be so sure
an effect of fatigue; but it means that the
resistance gates are down, and we become
aware of sensations pouring in from all sides,
slight sensations that ordinarily we take no
notice of because-by the laws of attention-

they are quietly shut out from our consciousness.
But when our attention is tired-no longer
focused, but scattering-all these slight nervepricks attack us insistently and we cannot
neglect them.

A noise that you Will not hear when you are
rested will be perfectly distracting when you
are tired. You will go over and shut a window; you will walk around aimlessly; you will
swear at the faint cackle of a distant graphophone. If there is a light above you at an
evening lecture, it will hurt your eyes almost
beyond endurance. Instead of making the
nervous system a less responsive instrument,
fatigue makes it more responsive. More
responsive, but less serviceable.

And at the same time that you have increased
irritability, you have decreased power. You
can take things up, but you cannot do them
hard. You can't put vim and snap into anything. You can't memorize well. You can't
think consecutively; your mind will constantly
wander to something else.

Irritability, weakness-thee two words belong together. A man who is constantly
fatigued can't work well or live well; and he
is very hard to live with.

Every man who is anxious to hit his job
between the eyes should make a study of his
own fatigue curve; and he should put the
moral of it to heart. To know when it's
time to quit-and to quit when it's time---.
is one of the first lessons in the primer of
efficiency.

COMMANDANT OF CADETS, HAMPTON NORMAL AND AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE

I had engaged work through Mr.

Ogden in Wanamaker's store in
Philadelphia. Meanwhile, one of the teachers
who had been engaged to teach in the Indian
summer school found at the last moment that
she could not come, and I was asked to take her
place; also to live in "the Wigwam," the
dormitory for Indian boys, and have general
charge of the Indian boys. It also happened

that Mr. Freeland, the Commandant, had to
go to the Dakotas to bring on a party of new
Indian pupils, so I began at once upon my new
duties. These were not entirely new so far as
the management of the boys was concerned,
but my relation to the Indian boys in "the
Wigwam" and my experience as a teacher of
Indian pupils, boys and girls, were both new
and interesting. At my request, Mr. Freeland
wrote Mr. Ogden, asking that I be released
