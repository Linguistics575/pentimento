TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

"mixed." He would have shrivelled to a
dyspeptic skeleton had he not "mixed." He
was the most democratic man in his class.
He has never had any fads or fancies, except
as an alumnus of Yale; he "roots" for Yale
and sings Yale songs, even far away in a
Philippine jungle, and is ready at the drop of a
hat to fight at any reaction on Yale. So what
must he have been when at Yale? He was the
most popular man there in many a day. How
he loved good stories and how the man could
laugh! It was not a coarse, boisterous guffaw,
but a laugh of the hearty, kindly simplicity of
soul, and of the genial overbubbling of a big
heart. The boys at Yale felt that, and they
were glad straight off. And then he was so
safe and comforting, no wonder that in college
and afterward everybody went to him for
advice! He always had sympathy for the
troubled one and there was the feeling that he
would go to the bottom of the question and
come up with a cheery bit of wholesome discourse. No wonder, again, that his popularity
naturally and simply took the measure of universal affection! And, of course, he was a
leader, as always before. Everywhere he was
active in the college life.

He rowed, boxed, wrestled, played football,
and worked in the gymnasium-just as he
"observed all the social niceties," dressed well,
and associated with the girls. He was impelled
to the exercising of his splendid, untrained
frame by what may be described as a humorously sordid motive. That is, he merely
wanted to keep in shape, not for athletic
prowess, but that he could keep awake to a
yet smaller hour of the morning for grinding-enlightened grinding. He applied Herbert
Spencer's dictum to the letter-to be a good
man you must be "a good animal." He was
lucky, as in other things, with the gift of
physique, but just as in other things, he did
not squander the principal of the gift. He
added to it, and there has never been any question about "Bill" Taft being "a good animal."

Some of the best stories of his strength
date from Yale. His were exploits to intensify the'Varsity's chagrin over not being
able to claim him for the Eleven. His immense
figure, never gross nor beefy but a mass of
clean flesh and sinew, was much more wieldy
now, even as the good jaws and chin were
getting outline in the round face. There were
a celerity and a certainty in his movements
that made him, and still make him, an extraor
9143

dinarily light and graceful dancer. He was
perhaps more ready, however, for a rush or a
fray of some kind.

He and Herbert W. Bowen, later Minister
to Venezuela, were physically the two biggest
men in the class of 1878. They used to wrestle
together and the score was about even between
them until the very last, during commencement
week, when Taft got the better of it in a farewell
bout. As a freshman, he had already put one
"soph" champion after another on a mat in
the gymnasium; and later, as a "soph," he
did this: There was a field day in Hamilton
Park and the class of'78, Taft's class, was not
faring well. The old enemy, now the junior
class, was disposed to gloat. Then came the
tug-of-war, and at the first trial the'78 team
lost. Taft could "stand it no longer. He
threw off his coat, grabbed the end of the rope
and squatted firmly.

"Now then," he said, angrily, "let the whole
junior class get on the other end!"

The'78 men yelled joyfully. For once "Old
Bill" had been provoked into an official contest.
The tug-of-war proceeded with him helping
on the end, but the juniors might as well
have tried to pull up Gibraltar.

Like all collegians in their normally abnormal
state, Taft imbibed brave, pure notions of public
affairs, and was fretted by exalted ideas as to
how the sovereign people should be governed.
Judge Taft was then in the national Administration, and the son at Yale, as he frankly confesses, was impatient with his father for not
seeming to value the "importance of pursuing
the up-to-date principles that should govern
the policy to be pursued by public men."
He adds, however, that "the step down from
senior year to a struggle for a living has a
healthy tendency in moderating this certainty
and severity of view."

With him, and with most of his classmates,
the laissevjaire doctrine made a particular
appeal. They held "that the only proper
object of legislation was to free the pathway
of commerce and opportunity from the effect
of everything but competition and enlightened
selfishness." They even looked on the governmental delivery of letters with suspicion as a
pernicious interference. Further, Secretary
Taft declared only a little while ago that he
still thought these principles orthodox and
sound, "if only the official application of them
is not carried to such an extreme as really to
interfere with the public welfare." This is
