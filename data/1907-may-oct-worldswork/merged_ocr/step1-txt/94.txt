IS THE DOCTOR A SHYLOCK?

FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT MEDICAL FEES AND INCOMES

BY

EDGAR ALLEN FORBES

ENTION the subject of medical fees
M in the average group of men and you
will learn that the American doctor
is "out for'the money"---is a kind of licensed
pirate, overhauling every disabled patient that
enters the harbor of his office. Wherever an
article on the subject appears outside of the
medical press, which only physicians read,
such is generally the point of view. Whenever
a literary man is confronted with a doctor's
bill, railroad corporations and trust magnates
dwindle into pygmies beside the medical
"plunderbund," and the editor or writer finds
solace only in giving the doctor wide and
scathing publicity. But it is a long search to
find, in the protests against medical greed,
actual figures on which the man without a
grievance may base his judgment.

It is a commonplace thing to hear men speak
of the exorbitant fees of to-day as a new development in our civilization-but our fathers and
our grandfathers and their grandfathers engaged in the same criticism. In a curious
examination of the first collection of the laws
of the Virginia Colony, I remember finding a
statute aimed at "divers avaritious and griping
practitioners in Physick and Surgery," a statute
which permitted the patient to have his doctor
arrested if he thought his bill too large. And
this rebellious attitude is extended also to other
bills in relation to sickness-the charges of the
druggist, of the trained nurse, and of the undertaker--but the doctor is regarded as the archpirate. _

It is a strange fact that although life and good
health are priceless possessions, we begrudge
all that it costs us to preserve them. The
probable reason is that such payments seem
a dead loss; there is nothing to show for the
expenditure. Another curious fact is that the
size of the fee has little to do with the outcry.
The Arkansas farmer, whose doctor charges
$ 1 a visit for a five-mile trip over a rough road,
howls as loudly as the New York business man

who yields up $ 10 for a visit that he himself
made to the physician's office.

THE DOCTOR'S POINT OF VIEW

It is too much to expect that the day will ever
come when patient and doctor will be agreed
on the subject of fees. Their points of view
are too widely different. The physician, it is
true, refuses to be considered in the same light
as a business man or a lawyer, and insists that
he is a public servant; but he looks at his income as a whole, not on any particular fee.
He compares the number of his working hours
and his responsibilities with those of men of
equal standing in other lines; and then he contrasts his income with theirs. And what is
his conclusion?

"One thing I am sure of," said one of the
most skilful and most conscientious surgeons
I ever knew-a man who has unquestionably
dragged scores and scores back from the borderland of death-" is that physicians are the
poorest paid of all the professions when you
consider the kind of service they render. A
doctor's bill is the last to be paid, and they
seldom do it with graciousness."

This view is practically universal among
medical men-specialists, city doctors, country
practitioners, and all. It is simply a case
where the men who pay the bills think one
way, and the men on the job think another
way. The patient divides the number of
dollars he pays by the hours of service he
individually has received; the doctor divides
his receipts for the day by the hours of medical
service he has actually given.

The doctor makes no secret of the fact that
he bases his charges partly on the service
rendered and partly on the patient's ability
to pay. The well-to-do classes resent this as
an injustice; the poorer classes ignore it and
complain equally loud; the doctor still insists
that the burden of his ministry to the suffering
poor should be shared by the well-to-do. If
