9120 WHAT FRANCE
declared against public vandalism or when the
city proposes a new monument or a new
statue, the papers immediately interview the
artists, thus affording the municipal authorities
and the general public a body of expert opinion
--a better way, I take it, than leaving matters
of taste to the discretion of an uncommonly
common Common Council!

One would hardly expect an object lesson
from Algiers, but I nevertheless saw something there that I coveted for America.
Richly oriental, yet magnificently French,
that colonial city has imitated the arcades of
the Rue de Rivoli. A row of pillars runs along
the curb and supports the upper stories of the
buildings, which jut out over the sidewalk,
making a roof for a sort of corridor, with the
street on one side and the shop fronts on the
other, so as to shelter you against both surfand
rain; for the French genius, while solicitous
for beauty, is equally solicitous for comfort.
In Paris, the city guards you even against
fatigue; you have never far to look for a bench,
and you do not attract attention by sitting
upon it, any more than by sitting at luncheon
in front of a Parisian caf√©. Meanwhile, Paris
guards you against din. With the exception
of Paris-Sport and La Fame, the newspapers
are quietly sold in pretty little kiosks; and
instead of paving their famous streets with
granite blocks, the Parisians prefer wood,
from which proceeds so little noise that you
need not raise your voice above conversational
tones as you stroll the Grand Boulevards,
though the wheeled trafhc there is simply
astounding.

And now observe a further detail: you are
helped to find your way-not merely by names
of streets, plainly and conspicuously labeled,
but also by numbers so placed upon houses as
to be easily discovered. Here we hide them
-at least in effect. There's absolutely no
telling what you are looking for or where to
look for it-whether big or little numerals,
gilt or bronze or porcelain, black on white or
white on black, while not by the shrewdest
guess can you determine whether to search
upon door or transom or gate or window. In
Paris, however, you invariably find the number
on the wall of the building a little above the
first-story windows, and it is uniformly a
square blue table with large white numerals.
You cannot miss it. A small matter, this?
Yes, but one of countless small matters that
illustrate the earnestness with which the French

intellect has essayed to alleviate the annoyance
and discomforts of city life and to raise municipal management to the dignity of a fine art.

But by no means a small matter is that splendid institution-the cab that goes. No Parisian
thinks of cabs as things that stand hour after
hour in front of hotels and railway stations,
refusing to move unless you agree to a fare that
only the imbecile or the desperate will pay.
Instead, the Parisian thinks of cabs as running
constantly, almost, and at a price so modest
that when there are three passengers they
would hardly economize on taking a'bus.
Here you have one of the notable differences
between France and America; we pay cabs
to stand still, mostly; they pay theirs to go.
And they have found a way to fix the price by
machinery, so there will be no squabbling
with the driver as you alight. Next to his seat
is a dial and on top of the dial a little red flag
with the word "Libre" on it. When the cab
starts, the coachman pushes down the flag,
thus setting the mechanism going. The figures
on the dial keep changing as you ride and
register your increasing indebtedness. The
contrivance will reckon by time or by distance,
take account of halts, and even record the
duration of the intervals when a sightseer has
ordered the cooker to "drive slowly, please."
The best of it is that the machine, which the
French call the taximetre, can't cheat.

Suppose, now, that we leave the street and
see what art, as applied to comfort-in the
broad sense Consul-General Mason would
give the word art-has done for the house.
Note its usual arrangement around a court and
its preference for a garden at the rear. The
court lets in air and sunshine, while affording
quiet to the rooms looking out upon it; and
the garden becomes also a living-room, even
a dining-room, if you like, for it is wholly
secluded from the highway. In this respect the
French town house is the American town
house turned completely around, with the front
yard behind. The ornamental space that is
all for show with us is all for enjoyment with
the French. Notice also that the garden is
not sodded; gravel serves better than grass,
since you are not afraid to tread on it and the
rain soaks through it so quickly that you can
go out directly after a shower.

As compared with our Gallic cousins, we
are an indoor people. They keep in the open
air all they can-sit there at their pleasure,
whenever possible at their work. Besides,
