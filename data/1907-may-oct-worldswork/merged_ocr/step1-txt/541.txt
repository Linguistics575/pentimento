JAPAN'S WAR TAX AND POVERTY

carriages, organizing to keep out newcomers
and to protect themselves. They felt that the
60,000 able-bodied'rickshaw men of Tokyo
ought to make themselves a force to be reckoned
with. Taki was not a member of the new
union, and was not desired.

One day Taki bethought himself of Harris,
the rugged young Englishman employed on the
staff of the Japan Times, a daily newspaper
published in English. When Harris had lived
in the neighboring village of Kanagawa, Taki
had been his'rickshaw coolie. So Taki went
to the very British Harris, and after many
bows and felicitations stated his condition and
asked the "honorable" writer's advice. Harris
said to him:

"Shobe, your condition is that of thousands
of your comrades; everywhere your countrymen are suffering; in several provinces they
are dying of starvation. Japan is weak with
exhaustion; it finished the war on nerve.
You and your fellows must go on paying the
price of victory. Peace will be harder than war
for many years to come, and all Japan-men,
women and children-must suffer together.
Japan has puffed out its chest and feels that it
must maintain the expansion; it will be a hard
business. I am sorry for you, Taki. Here are
five yen ($ 2.50). It is all that I can afford.
Please do not come again, for you are but one
of many good friends in equal distress."

Taki prostrated himself with thanks and left
broken-hearted. He felt that Harris had
spoken all too truly.

He clung desperately to his five yen while he
hunted employment. Everywhere he met veterans in the same straits. Taki and two other
soldiers pooled their little capital and rented
a tiny house in a street in the Shitaya quarter.
This street, occupied by the poorest of the poor,
is filled by 2,000 houses separated by alleys
crossing one another at right angles. One
large house under one long low roof is divided
into many little habitations by partitions. These
places are called nagaya. There are little shops
among them called yornzuya or "sellers of ten
thousand things." There are horse-flesh
restaurants and caf√©s where spoiled rice and
fish entrails are the stock In trade. Secondhand stores and pawnshops abound, for in
Japan the pawnbroker will make an advance
on any article that does not fall below a penny in
value.

The three veterans opened a little restaurant
called the tt Home of the Honorable Ten Thou

sand Heroes." The average bill for a guest
was four cents, but there were plungers who
squandered as much as eight cents, and these
had a feast, receiving for this sum three bottles
of sake, a dish of sashimi or raw fish served with
horse-radish, a cup of bean soup, and a saucer of
stewed fish. To them came many old soldiers
asking food, which was never refused. Had it
not been for the coolies employed in the larger
shops, who came in their working kimonos
bearing the sign of their employer on the back,
the three veterans would have soon lost their
all. As it was they lost, despite the fact that a
basket of shark entrails purchased for 30 cents
retailed for 50 and the heads of tunny fish
purchased for 25 cents brought in various
dishes fully $ 51.50. As times grew harder trade
grew slack; the number of soldier visitors
increased, and it was impossible to refuse the
poor devils something to cat when they pathetically gazed in silence at the tempting cuttlefish
and fresh corn. Then the rent was advanced
and the veterans, after borrowing money at 186
per cent. interest, finally gave up and moved to
a cheaper house of three mats with a backyard
just two feet wide. One by one they pawned
their clogs, sandals, and socks, their umbrellas,
braziers, little low tables, rice kettles, and
miserable bedding everything that could be
pawned.



THE GREED OF THE PAWNBROKERS

The Government rate of interest in the
pawnshops is supposed to be about one and
three-quarters per cent. a month, but by devious
devices the Tokyo Shylocks secure from five
to eight per cent. per month. Then, whenever an article was taken out, an additional
charge of one-half per cent. was made. In the
matter of pipes, the pawnbrokers, after advancing, would rent them out to their owners for a
few mills a day so that the unfortunate might
still have his smoke of a thimbleful of the horrible stuff supplied by the Government monopoly.
The three veterans huddled together on their
ragged old mats and lived on the entrails of
fish, horses and cattle, which, prepared in
itinerant kitchens by curb restaurateurs, were
sold nicely browned on long wooden skewers.
One skewer cost half a cent, and in common
with many of their neighbors they chewed the
very wood to extract the last atom of nourishment. For amusement they read newspapers
which when twelve hours old were sold to the
very poor for one-third of the original prices.
