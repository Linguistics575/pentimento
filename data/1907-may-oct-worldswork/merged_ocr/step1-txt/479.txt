A complete collapse of a city government,
through corruption or a physical calamity or
both, seems to suggest the same method of
escape; and the underlying principle of this
method is proving itself the saving principle
in our struggle for good municipal government.

SECTIONAL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS

SOUTHERN political thought lags very
far behind Southern activity of other
kinds. While industrial and educational
work are vigorous and liberal and courageous and in touch with contemporaneous
work elsewhere, the discussion of politics goes
back to a long-dead time. For instance, the
recurring discussion of nominating a Southern
man as the Democratic candidate for the
Presidency provokes such comment as this:
The New Orleans Picayune says:

"Why shall not the National Democratic party nominate
a Southern man for the Presidency? The answer is that it
would be most unwise, imprudent, and untimely to put up
a Southern man. It is yet too early to forget that... the Southern States fought a tremendous
war to establish the national independence of their section."

This kind of political thinking is done in terms
of more than forty years ago, when only a small
percentage of the men who will vote next year
were of age and most of them were not born.
It ignores all the changes that have taken
place since. It is very certain that no Presidential campaign could be won with such
servitude to the past as this. Suppose the
leaders of education, the builders of railroads,
of mills, and of cities in the South were to use
corresponding arguments of despair and
inactivity-what progress would they make?
The Civil War of a generation and a half or
two generations ago has gone completely out of
the minds of all men except these belated and
ancient political writers in the South.
Similarly, the St. Louis Republic:

"But in a measure isolated, formerly by slavery and
later by conditions incident to a large population of free
Negroes, the South has little sought the Presidency since the
'Virginia Dynasty' ended with Monroe. The South has
wisely preferred to fortify itself against attack by alliance in
the North and West, and the Southern Democracy in
National conventions has generally supported available
candidates belonging to those sections."

This sectional self-consciousness keeps sectionalism in politics alive.



IN THE SENATE 9277
Of another sort, however, is this true remark
by the Charleston (S. C.) News and Courier:
"The South will have no candidate for President until it has a man not afraid of his own
shadow." And it will not produce such a man
in politics till its leaders cease to think and to
talk always of "the South" and cease to be
burdened with a sectional self-consciousness.
The truth is, there has never been a better
chance in our whole political history for a man
to do a great political service than there now is
for a Democrat, preferably from some Southern state, to come forward and claim the nomination-the right kind of man on the right
kind of platform. He must be national in his
thought. He must have no sectional selfconsciousness. He must leave the war alone-a war that ended before he became of age.
He must talk of something else besides the
"Negro problem." He must have a program of interest and of justice to men alike in
Maine and in Georgia, in Minnesota and in
Oregon. He must not "be afraid of his
shadow," nor of Mr. Bryan, nor of the backward Southern political press. He must speak
the language of Tilden and of Cleveland, and
this must be also his own language. The
nomination of such a man might not lead to his
election next year (who is sure that any Democrat can be elected next year P), but it would
bring the party and the South out of the utterly
hopeless death-valley of its self-conscious sectionalism; and that would be a great gain.

CHANGES OF PERSONNEL IN THE SENATE

HE death of Senator Pettus, of Alabama,
at the age of eighty-six, following close
upon the death of his colleague, Senator Morgan, at the age of eighty-three, and this in turn
following the resignation of Senator Spooner,
of Wisconsin, who was among the strongest of
the Senators of recent times, remindsthe country
of the almost sudden change that will take place
in the leadership of the Senate. Among the
aged members now are Senator Allison, of
Iowa, seventy-eight; Senator Teller, of Colorado, seventy-seven; Senator Cullom, of
Illinois, seventy-eight; Senator Frye, of Maine,
seventy-six; the two Senators from New York,
seventy-three and seventy-four; Senator Proctor, of Vermont, seventy-six; and Senator
Whyte, of Maryland, eighty-three. These are
not all yet feeble by reason of age, but they
are all old men and the period of activity of
most of them will soon end.
