particular, the American-Hawaiian, which
owns steamers aggregating 100,000 tons, has
abandoned the Cape Horn route to associate
itself with the Tehuantepec project. During
the very first month the road handled 1,000 tons
a day.

The third feat of history-making also concerns transportation. Mexico is now a controlling partner in its two big trunk lines. It
faced that menace to ourselves, a pernicious

facilities and big orders for equipment are now
the rule.

As for new railroad construction, that is
going on throughout the republic on almost the
same gigantic scale as with us. Until now the
rugged backbone of the continent has kept the
rich coast country of the Pacific a virgin wilderness. Even a wagon may not find its way over
the impassable Sierra Madre, and yet both the
Central and the Southern Pacific are now in
the lists against crusty old geography. The

merging. It effected it through a new corporation with a capital stock of $ 225,000,000,
financed largely by American bankers, who
look for a speedy and vastly increased development of the properties. The hope is reasonable, because over the 7,000 miles of railroad
(out of a total of 11,000 miles in the country)
there will now prevail economy of operation
and elimination of competition. Depots, warehouses, sidings, all are piled high with freight.

Central is on the last link already, that between
Guadalajara and the terminal port, Manzanillo.
There has never been construction more difficult in Mexico, yet it has never been better.
The grade will in no place exceed 2 per cent. and
for one strip alone, not forty miles long, the
cost is $ 5,000,000. This is apart from the
harbor works at Manzanillo, where $ 3, 500,000
has been spent on the breakwater alone. Two
years more should see trains moving and
opening up territory that promises to be
one of the most productive regions in all Mexico.
The opportunities are possibly greater than
