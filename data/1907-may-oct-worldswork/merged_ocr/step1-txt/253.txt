THE PRESIDENTE INDIANAPOLIS SPEECH

of the people was so unmistakable. The anti,
Harriman flame has swept the country, kind,
ling fires not merely in the newspapers but in
the social clubs, the associations of manufacturers, shippers, agriculturists, lawmakers,
and even preachers of the gospel. The attack
is not so much on Mr. Harriman as on the things
for which the name of Mr. Harriman has come
to stand. The public, the shippers, the consumers, the railroad employees, the stockholders, are in open revolt against high-handed administration. The divine right of magnates, so
tersely expressed by Mr. Geo. F. Baer during
the coal strike, has received a very severe jolt.

Out of it will come weakness, then strength.
When any great mechanism is suddenly thrown
out of gear, the jolt is apt to be disturbing.
The insubordination and the re-adjustment of
this year have thrown out of gear the most
complicated machine and the greatest machine
in America-the administrative function of our
huge corporations. Luckily, the first shock
fell upon Wall Street, and the people barely
felt it. It is too much to hope that the great
industrial life of the country can escape scotfree; but there seems fair hope that the disturbance that must follow will be neither very
serious nor very protracted.

When the shock passes, the machine will
probably run much better than before. The
people of the United States look forward with
confidence to the day when real railroad men
will run the railroads, administer their policies,
and plan their operations. The people demand
that the railroad executive function be divorced
entirely from the Wall Street ticker, at least
in relation to the traffic, the making of rates,
and all the other phases of the administration
with which the people come in contact. And
the people are right. The country needs and
must have railroad men who can get much
nearer the people of the West than they can
get by a visit to the Chicago Club.

The measure of the prosperity of the railroads and the people in the next few years will
be the measure of the unanimity with which
the railroad magnates lay aside the fiction of
prerogative with which they have deceived
themselves for the last ten years and come down
into the open to meet the people face to face
and hand to hand, not in struggle but in
friendly service. All signs-but one or two-point to this regeneration. It must come, and
the blind men who shall oppose it will be
swept aside by the current of the time,

THE CHECK TO RAILROAD BETTERMENT

HE greatest hurt done by the railroad

agitation has been to increase the dif..
iiculty of the roads in borrowing money for
better equipment, for extensions, for larger
terminals, for double tracks, and such other
improvements as their great volume of traffic
demands. This disadvantage in many cases
is real and serious-with the railroads of the
South, for example. But the check thus put
upon improvement and extension will at the
worst be temporary. If favorable conditions
continue in the business world, these extensions
and improvements will be made-more slowly
than if large sums could immediately be bor,
rowed, but none the less surely. And a temporary disadvantage, however serious, does
not counterbalance the permanent advantage
of bringing railroad practice into proper
relation with good conduct and with other
activities of the people. No serious student
of large tendencies can forget that a little while
ago it was not an absurd question to ask
whether the railroads would rule the people
or the people rule the railroads. But this
question is now not seriously asked in any
quarter. If in any quarter it be now asked
whether the railroads will continue to pay,
the answer is that if they paid under reckless
financial management they ought ultimately
to do better under safeguarding regulation.

THE PRESIDENT'S INDIANAPOLIS SPEECH

RESIDENT ROOSEVELT, in his recent

speech at Indianapolis, set himself the
task of stating and explaining these two propositions-that the regulation of railroads was
not going to cease, and that their regulation
would not unsettle values. Events are proving the truth of both propositions, and neither
involves any radical thought or conduct.

But as a literary task, so to call it, the explanation of both these propositions required the
frequent use of balanced sentiments and
sentences and of the preposition but. The
captious critics of the President have made
much of his this but that. Yet there isn't a
man who heard or read the speech that did not
understand it and that did not clearly see that
its purpose was to allay financial apprehension,
if any financial apprehension exist, and to
allay it without changing the Administration's
policy at all. It had that effect; and whether
that effect were produced by the use of many
buts or in spite of them is a problem for
