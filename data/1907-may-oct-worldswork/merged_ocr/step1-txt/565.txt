A NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN

Green County, in the centre of which the community is located, is one of the most prosperous
counties in the whole rich farming region of
southern Ohio, and is noted as a centre of the
stock-raising industry of the state.

Approaching from the city, there is nothing,
at a little distance, except the college buildings
to distinguish Wilberforce from any of the
other country villages which one meets in this
part of the country. It is merely a little
cluster of houses against a background of
pleasant woods, a little centre of country
residences with lawns and gardens, and a few
farmhouses on the outskirts.

But turning from the country road into the
wide avenue along which the town is arranged,
you find yourself in the midst of a quaint and
beautiful little college town, which has some
of the rustic charm of a country village, with
something, also, of that flavor of refinement
and grace which inevitably comes, with time,
to every college town, where men are permanently bound together for a high purpose.
On one side of the long avenue, along which
the town has arranged itself, are the college
buildings, and on the other are the homes of
the teachers and officers of the school. The
road terminates in a little wood, and rambles
off into the meadows beyond the town.

A CONTRAST TO MOUND BAYOU

Different in almost every way from the
sprawling frontier village of Mound Bayou,
which I have described in a previous article,
Wilberforce is quite as distinctively a Negro
community. Mound Bayou, situated in the
wilderness of the Yazoo Delta of Mississippi,
is a pioneer town. It exhibits in a picturesque
and unique way the struggle of the masses of
the Negro people in the South to get possession of the land and make it their own. Wilberforce is older, slower, less enterprising, and
more beautiful.

Mound Bayou has sprung up as the centre
of an industrial enterprise. Wilberforce has
grown up about a school and reflects in its
homes the slow, refining influence of half a
century of Negro education:

It is only during the last twenty or twentyfive years that the masses of the Negro people
have begun to seek a solution of their problem
in industrial progress. The first great passion
of the Negro race after the war was for education. If the church stands for the first great
interest in which the Negro, as a race, has

sought salvation, it may be said that the
schoolhouse represents the second. The College
of Wilberforce, which is, so far as I know, the
first permanent institution of learning founded
by Negroes in this country, gave at an early
period a definite expression to that aspiration.
It came into existence in the midst of the
commotion of the great Civil War, at a time
when the masses of the people were still in
slavery: at a time when everything that concerned the Negro people, their fitness for
freedom and their capacity for education, was
looked upon with much more doubt than it
is to-day. In the half century since that time
the scattered Negro community in which the
College began its work, while it has not to any
great degree increased in size, has grown to
represent in a very concrete way, in its homes
and the habits of the people, the spirit and
influence of the College.

There are a certain number of persons who
are in the habit of saying that Negro education
has been a failure, for the reason that it has
tended rather to increase than to diminish
the number of Negro criminals. It is my
experience that whenever a permanent school
for Negroes has been established, there has
almost always grown up around it a permanent,
decent, and orderly Negro community. I do
not know where one can better study the actual
effects of education upon the Negro than in
these communities, where one can see the concrete results of its permanent and lasting
influence.

If Mound Bayou represents what Negroes
have accomplished in the direction of industrial
progress and political self-control, then Wilberforce may be said to represent the slower and
subtler influence which the patient struggle to
gain an education has had upon the life and
character of the race.

Wilberforce is both a college and a town.
But many persons who know something of
the College and its history know nothing of
the community that has grown up around it,
though the community is older than the College.
Its history reaches. back into the days before
the war, when the Northwest Territory, made
free by the ordinance of 1787, was a refuge for
Negroes who sought permanent freedom.

HOW THE COMMUNITY STARTED

In its origin, Wilberforce is at once a representative and a survivor of a number of
somewhat similar Negro communities which
