Nor is this all. During the summer vacation,
the city (at public expense) sends the poor
children on excursions to the country, to the
seaside, or even to Switzerland, the outing
varying from a few days to a month, according
to the physical condition of the children. In
the Council's opinion, the way to have healthy,
wholesome, and vigorous men and women is to
have healthy, wholesome, and vigorous boys and
girls. It believes in the "ounce of prevention."

PROVIDING HOMES FOR THE POOR

"Housing" is a burning subject in Paris,
for the city grows apace and, as always happens,
the tendency of its growth is to constrict the
poorer quarters. The problem of overcrowding
is not wholly solved to this day; compared with
London and some other cities, however, few
families in Paris are crowded. But the Council
wants better conditions. Two years ago it
appointed a commission to investigate and report upon the whole subject of the dwellings of
the poor. The commission, disregarding the
convenient fence of comparison behind which
distressed municipal bodies habitually take
refuge, declined to say that Paris was not as
bad as it might be, but declared unequivocally
that even the crowding that exists in Paris is a
hot-house for disease, drunkenness, and prostitution. It discussed in its report many things
that might be done, and then declared that
the city should build houses and offer them for
rent, giving preference to the largest and poorest
families.

But there was the Senate! The Council
had found by this time how helpless was the
task of breaking a way through that august
convocation of grave and reverend antediluvians; and while it waited for Providence to
cease to afflict France with a Senate, it turned
to remedies within its grasp. One was to
encourage building societies. These, operating
always under the approval of the Minister of
Labor, can borrow money from the government
savings banks at 3 per cent. These societies
must build sanitary houses, subject to the
approval of official committees. In Paris the
annual rent of their houses must not exceed
$ 110; in small towns the rent is often as little
as $ 28. All of these societies are under the
Government's control. About forty of them
exist in and about Paris. The state will not
allow them to pay more than 4 per cent. in
annual dividends to their shareholders. They
are filling some of the suburbs with tasteful,

airy, and sanitary dwellings, subject to purchase
on reasonable and easy terms by the tenants.

Observant visitors to Paris must have noticed
how comparatively free are its streets from
idlers, tramps, and outcasts. You do not hear
of Parisian processions of the unemployed,
nor of an ever-increasing menace from regions
corresponding to Stepney and Whitechapel,
in London. One reason is that the municipality is determined that, so far as possible, every
man in the city shall work and that no person
shall be shelterless. There is a peculiar kind
of municipal establishment, part workhouse
and part refuge, that has this task in hand.
It exists in fair numbers throughout the city
under the direction of a city bureau. Any
man out of work can apply in the daytime at
one of these institutions and receive a ticket
entitling him to food and lodging for the night.
If he finds work he does not, in most cases,
return to the refuge; but, in any event, he is
sure of shelter and food. If his hunt for work
is fruitless, he comes back with his ticket, gets
a bath, has his clothes steamed and pressed,
eats a supper of bread and soup, and sleeps in
a separate bed for which 7 So cubic feet of air
is allowed-and knows that bed and bedding
have that day been cleaned and disinfected. In
the morning he arises at six o'clock, has a
breakfast of bread and soup, and is free to
depart to look for work. Or, if he prefers, he
can labor in the workhouse that is part of the
refuge. The Municipal Council encourages
these workhouses and helps to keep them busy.
For instance, all the firewood used by the city
is prepared at these places.

Similar institutions exist for women. Besides a night refuge or lodging-house these have
an industrial refuge for unemployed workingwomen, a home for expectant mothers, an
asylum for convalescent: after childbirth, a
temporary asylum for children, an asylum for
orphan girls. Some of these enterprises seem
to express an unusually broad spirit of charity.
For instance, at the industrial refuge for women
out of work, a woman is received with her
children and, in extreme cases, maintained
there for four days while she searches for a
situation. At the end of that time, if she should
not find anything to do, she is employed as a
seamstress at another city establishment.
Meantime, her children are not taken from her
but are educated at a school under the same
roof. In the children's asylum the babies
are cared for in a creche; children from one to
