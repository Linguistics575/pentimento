DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR

vessel for $ 15. Upon his refusal to sign and
sail, his chest and clothes were taken away and
held on a pretended lien for board, and he was
thrown out on the streets to freeze or ship.
Ignorant of our language and laws, without
money or friends, and literally without a coat
to his back or shoes for his feet, someone
directed the shivering man to the Legal Aid
Society. Within an hour, the Society succeeded in arraigning the "crimp" before a
magistrate, forced him to disgorge all of the
man's property, and placed the sailor where he
could be safe from any further attacks of the
modern press-gang. The Harlem Branch in
New York has attorneys who can talk with
clients in Czech, French, Moravian, Magyar,
Slavonian, and Yiddish.

A young boy in Philadelphia was left, on the
death of his parents, with a little sum from their
life insurance. A disbarred attorney and a
dive-keeper planned to gain possession of this
fund. When the attention of the Society was
called to the case, the boy was already with the
dive-keeper and a petition had been drafted
for the appointment of the latter as guardian
of his person and property. By the interposition
of the Society, the application was withdrawn;
the boy has been placed in a good home, and
his money deposited in trust for him until he
becomes of age.

Another boy from the slums committed an
offence punishable by fine. Through perjured
testimony, he was indicted for a crime punishable by fifteen years' imprisonment. On the
day fixed for his trial, the Society was able to
lay the true facts before the district-attorney.
The graver charge was dismissed, the boy
pleaded guilty of the lesser offence, was fined,
and then released so that he might earn the
amount of his fine.

The Societies have been successful also in
getting new laws enacted to cover defects which
they have had occasion to observe. The
Legislature of New York, acting at the suggestion of the Legal Aid Society, recently passed
a law which provides that when wages are
assigned to a money-lender, a copy of the
assignment shall be filed with the employer
within three days. "This requirement has
served as a great check on the operations of
these usurious companies," said Mr. Cornelius
P. Kitchel, lately the chief attorney of the New
York Society, "Publicity is the very thing
which the employee desires to avoid. He
knows that it is apt to go hard with him if his

9093

employer discovers that he has assigned his
wages, and the requirement that knowledge of
the assignment be brought home to the employer
oefore it can be valid has had a very salutary
effect. Our experience has shown us, however,
that the present law ought to be amended.
The loan companies have resorted to the
expedient of having the borrower sign a mere
power-of-attorney to someone else to assign
his wages, instead of actually assigning them
himself, and the situation thus arising should
be clearly covered by the law."

The East-Side Branch in New York has
always been very deeply concerned with the
solution of the cases of abandonment and nonsupport of wives and children. The frequency
of this offence in the lower East Side of New
York is startling, but since it was impossible to
have the delinquent husband or father who had
fled from the state brought back for trial on
the charge of desertion and non-support, the
Society found itself practically helpless. After
much discussion, the law was amended. It is
now possible to have these offenders brought
back and held for the support of their families.
This is another instance in which the exertions
of the Society to improve the existing laws
have been most effectual.

The most recent reform is that in regard to
prohibiting "the shanghaiing" of men to work
in the oyster fields in Chesapeake Bay. Men
are attracted by false statements or actually
kidnapped by oyster boatmen and forced to
work on the boats under conditions of virtual
slavery. How terrible these conditions were
was shown in the evidence brought out by
United States District-Attorney Rose, of Balti,
more, at the time of the investigation made by
the Legal Aid Societies of New York and Philadelphia. It was then shown that "shanghaiing" was going on unchecked on the oyster
boats of Chesapeake Bay, and that men unused
to seafaring lives were forced to remain night
and day for months on the open oyster boats,
without sufficient food and clothing and without
wages. The boats never put into shore, the
supplies being delivered and the oysters taken
away by tugs, and it was only after a raid by a
United States Revenue cutter that the full
state of affairs was revealed. Mr. Rose
stated that in the seven years in which he had
tried these cases he had never met with one
man who had ever been paid a day's wages, no
matter how long he had worked. Largely
owing to the energy of Legal Aid attorneys, a
