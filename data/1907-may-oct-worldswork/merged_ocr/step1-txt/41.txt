ADVENTURES

Chalmers Adams, reached New York from a
three years' trip through South America with
cameras. They brought back 3,000 pictures.
To get them, they had circled the whole continent, crossed the Andes four times, ascended
the Amazon, Orinoco, Magdalena, and Paraguay Rivers, traveled 40,000 miles in every

another time, .a trunk with hard-earned

treasures was lost overboard from a lighter.

plain; the backyards were filled with glaciers.

"To reach this place, we journeyed in the

a bitterly cold wind, endeavoring to reach an

These semi-civilized Quichuas are not hospitable and their huts are unclean; but nights
spent in the open at these altitudes mean intense
suffering, perhaps death. One night we lost
our way, as the snow fell heavily and covered
the trail. At about ten o'clock, after seventeen hours in the saddle, my hands became too
stiff to hold the reins and I fell exhausted to
the ground. But we found that fate had
guided us to a llama train-a few Indians
and their pack of laden llamas. The natives
pinched one another to keep awake and
nestled among the animals for warmth, so we
