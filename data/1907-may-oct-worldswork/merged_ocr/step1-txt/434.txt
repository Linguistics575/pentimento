9232 CAN HUMAN LIFE

As the result of the great revolutions growing
out of Pasteur's discoveries regarding fermentation, present views and leanings may be defined somewhat as follows:

(r) The processes of life formation are
founded in chemical re-combinations of matter.

(2) All matter must be split up into .its
ultimate forms--corpuscles, atoms, and molecules-bcfore it can form new combinations;
they are the structural bricks of the universe.

(3) This dissolution into primary forms in
organic, or living, matter is accomplished by
fermentation.

(4) In the process of dissolution, the particles
of matter become electrically charged into
positive and negative "ions"; therefore,

(s) The force which underlies the affinities
and antagonisms of molecular matter, which
causes some substances to fly to one another
and others to fly apart, is ultimately electrical.

(6) Those combinations which can growhold their individuality and keep adding to iti
constitute life.

(7) Growth and decay are both accomplished
through fermentation, the one constructive,
and the other destructive.

(8) Aside from accidents, the measure of
one's years depends upon the relative strength
of these two antagonistic ferments in the body.

For man to stay the hand of time, to extend
the condition of youth or to check growth in
any living thing, he must be able to interfere
with an apparently universal law of Naturethat every individual growth has a limited era
in which it can build faster than the ferments
will pull down. This he can do to some extent.
To be able to do this is almost to be able to
create life out of chemicals. This has been done
to some extent, but these wonderful achievements are a long way from controlling the
advance of age in the human being. But
though the functions of man, compared with
those of an angle-worm, are enormously
multiplied, yet the variety of materials is very
slight. The size of the fertilizing cell of reproduction in the mouse and guinea pig is twice
as large as the cell in man and the elephant.

THE RESULTS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED

Until the middle of the nineteenth century,
chemists knew only how to "analyze" matter,
to separate a compound into its primary
elements. Then began the development of
the reverse process-" synthetic" chemistry,
or the putting together again-constructive,

inorganic chemistry. Attack was next made
on the problems of synthetic production of
living matter. To-day there are over 50,000
artificial chemical products, many of them
(like the indigo and rose madder dyes) putting
an end to their manufacture by gardening.
Dozens of elements contribute to the synthesis
of inorganic compounds, while four-carbon,
oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen-almost wholly
compose those of living compounds. All the
wonderful forms of such living matter as the
flavors of jellies and the odors of flowers, the
leaves and roots, the bones, muscles, nerves,
and brains, are combinations of these few simples. Yet the difference between living and
inert compounds depends upon the way in
which molecular elements group themselves.
We can picture an army of molecules as a
mass of soldiers in "irregular formation."
A command flies from the general to every
individual soldier. In a flash, we see a solid
front, ready to attack; or a hollow square,
ready for defence; or a column, ready to defile
through a mountain pass. The molecular
"grouping" is obedient to an electrical balancing between negative and positive that picks
them up as chaff before the wind, and whirls
them into spheres of action as beautiful in
equilibrium as the play of the planets around
the sun, and in the same way.

Chemists had believed that the power to so
combine inert into living matter lay in an
unknown, mysterious influence called "the
vital force." Rather concisely stated, we
might say that all vital growth and action are
founded on chemical stimulation-ultimately
electrical; that what looks like the hand of
Providence mysteriously guiding the unintelligent cells, the brainless plants, the wholly
inexperienced and helpless new-born mind,
the homing pigeon-what we call "instinct"
---is but the expression of certain chemical and
electrical forces, the unconscious response of
certain appetites to particular stimulants.
Snyder has interestingly explained the operation of these forces in the following statement:

"A flower standing in a room turns its petals towards the
light. To the birds we ascribe intelligence, to the flower
no more than the attraction of light. Yet it seems as if
the selfsame forces rule over both. When the new-born
caterpillar climbs to the end of a branch where it may find
the fresh bud on which it feeds, it seems as if some dim
intelligence were at work. When it is satisfied, it climbs
down again. A fly will lay its eggs in meat, whereon its
larvae may feed, but not on fat.
