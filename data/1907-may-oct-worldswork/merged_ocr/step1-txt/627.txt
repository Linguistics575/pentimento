(HTY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

fore proceeds from the people. It ordinarily
has a reasonably long term of office, or its
members are but slowly replaced year after
year. Because this is its nature, it can be disinterested, prudent, fore-looking, and wise
through experience. All city business, like
all corporation business, needs a management
which is thus continuous, and so may reasonably be expected to exercise foresight and good
judgment in discerning and meeting the needs
of the future. It is impossible to do city business well through bodies replaced every year
by an annual election; if it were ever possible,
it has ceased to be so, and the chances are that
it was never possible. The commission or small
central board charged with a part or the whole
of the city's business ought to be elected by the
people, unless the existing political conditions
make it more prudent to have it appointed by
an authority outside the city, as was the case
with the Boston commissions and partly the
case at Galveston. In the successive elections
of a member or members of such commissions,
the people have an annual opportunity of expressing their content or discontent with the
management of the commissions; but, as has
already been said, there are other available
means of procuring direct expressions of the
will of the people on explicit proposals when
such expressions are needed, namely, the two
processes called the initiative and the referendum. Two other indirect modes of bringing
the opinions and wishes of the people to bear
upon such commissions are already in active
use; one is furnished by the'daily and weekly
press, the other is the method of public hearing.
The latter, because completely public, is the
more effective of the two. The annual reports
of commissions, the public press, and the hearing, together give a large amount of publicity
to the operations of such commissions, and this
publicity will secure to the people an adequate
control over their operations.

Democracy, like autocracy, needs to keep
account of the rapidly changing conditions of
human society. What might have been undemocratic a century ago may easily be safely
democratic now. Democracy also needs to
use in its governmental business the scrap-heap
which is so important to the sound management
of industries. It should throw away the obsolete
machinery with which it finds itself encumbered
and build the new machinery which will do its
work efficiently and honestly on the vaster
scale of the present day.

No improvement in the form of American
city government can remedy the existing abuses
and evils, unless the change of form be ae
companied by the selection of a different sort
of man to conduct the new government. What
then are the reasons for thinking that suitable
men could be obtained to administer municipal
affairs discreetly and honorably, if government
by commission or selectmen should be adopted P
The right men for the new sort of administration would be experienced business men who
had already been successful in their several
occupations, and who therefore had a large
stake in the moral and material welfare of the
community over which they were chosen to
preside. At present, almost all the men who
serve as aldermen and councilmen in the
American cities are of small capacity, and have
never succeeded in any business or serious
undertaking. Over and over again lists of the
aldermen and councilmen of American cities
have been published which show most of them
to have little or no property and no describable
means of support. In short, they are not
persons who have given evidence of capacity
to administer successfully any large affairs.

SMALL BOARDS ATTRACT BETTER MEN

In the first place, the five men who would
administer a city like Galveston would each
have a considerable amount of power and direct
responsibility, and the five united would have
all the power. Each man's term of service
would be at least five years long; so that he
would have ample time to prove his quality
and demonstrate his usefulness to the community. Each could look ahead and make
long plans, and in all probability see them
carried out. The board, or commission, as a
whole would feel that they had a trust to
execute, and that the means of executing it
were in their hands. Wherever this method
has been applied, either to the whole or a part
of the city's work, as a matter of fact a superior
class of men has at once appeared in municipal
administration. Thus the school committee
of St. Louis was suddenly reduced to twelve
men to whom were confided large powers and
more public money than had ever been appropriated for school purposes in St. Louis. The
result was that an admirable board was
immediately chosen, and the high quality of
this board has been maintained. In Galveston, as soon as the control of the city was
placed by the new charter in the hands of five
