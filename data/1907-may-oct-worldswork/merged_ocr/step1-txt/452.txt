who are apt to regard Austria as a Christian
andprogressive Power instead of the ogre of
the Balkans. To the injustices inflicted upon
the peasantryhto their many grievances and
their viorititrfights, I have not space here to
refer. Austria seeks to Germanize the whole
land by steel and by hunger. The injustice
and cruelty of the police is unspeakable-parallelled only in Russia. Austria systematically covers its sins against Bosnia by bribing
press correspondents, by suppressing the publication of unfavorable books, and by paying
systematic blackmail to every newspaper in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

And this is the Austria that to-day plans to
dominate the Balkans! Go to the Balkans
and you will see what I have seen. You will
realize the clever, subtle influence of Austrian
agents in Montenegro where they persuade
the pride of the country to emigrate, themselves

paying the expenses, and thus sap the nation
of its future population; in Northern Albania,
where the priests in Austrian pay never cease
to descant upon the benefits of Austrian rule;
in Servia, where they are always stirring strife;
in Bulgaria, where their spies are ever active;
and in Macedonia, where they secretly encourage the Greek bands to massacre the Bulgars.
Thus over the whole of the Balkans Austria
has spread forth its wings, and its dark threatening shadow is now over everything. The
Austrian policy is to compete with Germany
and become the paramount Power in the
Peninsula, and obtain Montenegro, Albania,
and Macedonia for itself, together with the
much-coveted port of Salonica. From this
latter point, it already has a railroad through
Uskiib, joining the main Vienna-Constants'nople line at Nisch, in Servia. Therefore,

part of the policy is to lay hold of the kingdom



of Servia. Fortunately, Servia knows how to
take care of itself.

Servia to-day bars Austria's way southward
to Salonica. It is, therefore, not to Austria's
interest that Servia should be at peace. So
long as things went badly in Servia, Austria
allowed matters to go on without interference
and watched eagerly for the downfall of the
kingdom. Unfortunate events occurred, as is
well known, but, to the great dismay of Servia's
arch-enemy, the country has become contented and is greatly prospering under the rule
of King Peter. For this reason, Austria has
once again sought to stir discord and to create
troubles and difficulties. At the moment of
writing, the secret police have a list of more
than one hundred Austrian political agents
living in Belgrade alone!

From King Peter himself, and from M.
Patchitch, his Secretary of State, I learned that
