THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD

should visit London and write of the ruins of
St. Paul's? London still stands, but the
gentleman from Lima is ready to fulfil his part
of the contract whenever London falls. Lima
boasts the oldest university on the whole
American continent. To-day, it is establishing
training schools and technical colleges in the
higher sciences. Education is spreading. With
it commerce grows, wealth increases, industry
reaches out its hands and grasps the tools of
its usage. The mines of the mountains yield
up their gold and copper, the great forest plains
their wealth of timber and rubber. Light
dawns in old Peru-and in Ecuador.

Who hears of Guayaquil? Anyone who
does considers it merely "one of those little
South American places" and lets it go at that.
Our minister to Ecuador, Mr. Joseph Lee,
immortalized it recently before the National
Geographic Society by the claim that its Union
Club is the best in the tropics, with the exception of the Hong Kong Club. Guayaquil
is the emporium of Ecuador, a busy, live, commercial city. Britain, Germany, and France
are building up a steady trade with it, and finding it to pay.

Back of it, away in the mountains, lies
Quito. It attained a fleeting fame in our
geographies as "the highest town in the world."
To-day, it is opening its doors to a railroad,
creeping up from Guayaquil. The railroad
is being built by a New Jersey corporation,
which may or may not be a sign' of enlightenment. If anybody regard Quito as an outlandish place, let him study, for a moment, the
following extract from the report of Mr. Lee,
before referred to:

"Ladies in smart victorias, drawn by Chilean or native
horses, drive to and from the shops with merchandise from
Paris, New York, London, Vienna, and Berlin. Handsome officers in full regimentals stroll along the streets.
Gentlemen in frock coats and top hats are everywhere.

"There are several good hotels in Quito-the Royal
Palace, Hotel de Paris, Hotel Americana, and the
Case Azul.

"The people of Quito are charming, courteous and
hospitable. I do not know any city of its size which
contains so many intelligent and cultivated people!"

Let us take for granted the progress of Chile
and Brazil, with their greatly widening markets,
their splendid universities, their modern
methods of transportation, their constantly
growing foreign trade. These things are
written in the consular reports of the United
States'dryly, it is true, but clearly enough.

Venezuela and Guiana are worth fighting for.
All over South America the banners of en-.
lightenment and commerce wave proudly, side
by side as, step by step, the nations rise.

MEXICO UNDER PRESIDENT DIAZ

In North America, too, there is progress.
About the great central city of Mexico there is
a new awakening. The lifetime of a Diaz,
the finest product of Latin America, has been
devoted to this end, and the declining years of
the great President see the beginning of the new
life he has sought to bequeath to his country.
For Mexico has but this last year taken a
great step that will, in time, put it on an equality
with the commercial nations-namely, the
adoption of a gold standard. The layman,
wise in lack of economic training, finds it hard
to realize that a debased currency has been one
of the great factors in preventing the advancement of Mexico, or any other country, as a
commercial nation. Yet it is true. The year
1906 will probably go down in Mexican history
as the year in which this final step was taken-and as the beginning of an era of commercial
growth for the land of Cortez.

And commerce does grow, to-day, in Mexico.
Of course, there will never be true internal
growth, nor will there ever be full national
stature, until the peons become land-owners
and the great estates are homesteaded. As it
stands to-day, the great mass of Mexico's
15,000,000 inhabitants owns no land, does
little or no work, lives as live the beasts of the
field. To remedy that will take many generations, yet even to-day Mexico has put its hand
to the plow for the tilling of this most stubborn
of its fields.

It has adopted a campaign of education--real education. There are to-day nearly 6,000
schools under state and central government,
nearly 2,500 under municipal government,
and hundreds of parochial schools in Mexico.
Nearly a million boys and girls are steadily at
school. More than sixty colleges exist for
higher education, and they are increasing
constantly. Quite recently, Mill's "Logic,"
Spencer's "Ethics," and many other philosophic
and economic text-books have been translated
into the native tongue. American critics,
such as Professor J. Mark Baldwin, have nothing but praise for the educational policies they
find in operation in the Republic of Mexico.

And what of China-the degenerate? The
fact of the matter seems to be that the terrible
