THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE

THE GREAT WORKING REVIVAL IN THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING CENTRE
OF THE UNITED STATES-A TYPICAL TOWN OF INTELLECTUAL INDUSTRIALISM

BY

ARTHUR W. PAGE

twenty feet higher, a passenger would
hardly be out of sight of a cotton mill
from the time he left Danville, Va., until he
reached Atlanta, Ga.--a distance of 400 miles.
It is one long mill village; and within the last
thirty years the part of the Carolinas and of
Georgia known as the Piedmont region has
become one of the great cotton-manufacturing
districts of the world. And there are, of course,
many cotton mills, and some of the largest,
further South. This industry has caused a
rapid and dramatic transformation of the
people. To get a measure of this transformation, it seemed to me better to make a study
in detail of a mill community-a community
that owes its prosperity almost wholly to its
mills-than to make a general study of a wide
area. I selected the town of Spartanburg,
S. C.; but I might have selected any one of
dozens of other towns.

The street from the station is paved with
vitrified brick and is scrupulously clean.
Almost the first buildings in sight are a large
public school and a public library. In the
centre of the main square is a statue to General
Morgan, the hero of the battle of the Cowpens.
There is one telephone for every eighteen
people in the town, including the Negroes and
mill "hands." On the corner of Wall Street
there is a United States Depository; within
sight there are six or seven other banks.
That 5,000 or 6,000 men and their families
should have built for themselves so well appointed a city seemed surprising. The president of one of the banks told me the reason:

"Two things made it," he said, "smokestacks and education."

The story of the smokestacks and of education in Spartanburg is an important chapter
in the second great emancipation of the South
-the commercial emancipation. In 1880,
it was a straggling town in a county of
small and not very prosperous farms. On

the porches of the stores the loafers sat and
chewed tobacco. Two thousand dollars was
a large month's business for a merchant, and
even this was practically all credit. A man
who had lived there described the sidewalk
as a cowpath to the courthouse, and at times
the streets were so bad that once a mule was
said to have drowned in a mud-hole in one of
them. A little way from the main square was
an old man who could make baseball bats
and turn a top, and he was the principal
manufacturer.

But two institutions were to change the COWpath to concrete and to make the village of
1880 the city of to-day. Five miles from town
Mr. D. E. Converse had a cotton mill, and at
the edge of town stood the old building of
Wofford College. Mr. Converse had found
work at some small job in a little cotton mill
in 1855. When the mill was reorganized the
next year, he received a share in it. Such was
the start in life of the man who is known as the
pioneer cotton manufacturer in South Carolina.
He operated the mill during the war for the
Confederate Government and contrived to
keep it going even during Reconstruction. As
the country grew quieter, his mill began to
make a profit and he determined to build
another. To raise the $ 200,000 necessary
for the new mill was a difficult undertaking at
that place and time. Few people believed in
the venture and, besides, they had little money.
A man in South Carolina could get little credit
in the banking centres of the country and the
prevailing rates of interest were IO per cent.
and 12 per cent., even higher. Insurance on
Southern mills was fifteen times as costly as
it is now. It was thought, too, that the climate
was not adapted to cotton manufacturing, that
no labor could be found successfully to operate
the machinery, that the mills in Europe and in
other parts of the United States were so well
established that a mill in South Carolina could
not compete with them. But Mr. Converse
