9256 HOW TO KEEP
that nobody in the community knew the methods
by which the Borough President was spending
the people's money. The inquiry was begun
in January, 1906, by men engaged to work
every day until the task was finished. The
results were published in November, 1906.

The report showed that the Borough President could not himself know what his subordinates were doing because misleading records
were kept; that for two years his books had not
even been balanced; that friends and aliases of
borough officials had received jobs without
public bids; that $ 5,000 jobs were divided
into five contracts of 351,000 so that the letter
of the law should not be violated; that the
Borough President had used $ 250 a month
for unspecified expenses; that streets were
neglected because inefficiency prevailed. There
was nothing picturesque or sensational about
such evidence. Its publication aroused no one
to a white heat of moral indignation. In fact,
it is safe to guess that among any particular
thousand "best citizens" in New York not
ten ever gave the first announcement a second
thought.

When the report was published, the Borough
President won for himself no little sympathy
by asking the Mayor for a thorough investigation. He had "absolutely nothing to conceal"--the same appealing candor as was
used by insurance plunderers, more recently
by Ruef of San Francisco, and always by
offenders so long as they think the searchlight
is temporary. The Mayor's Commissioners
of Accounts pottered around a few days and
then reported that they had examined the books
and acts of the Borough President's various
officers and were happy to say that, while
certain technical irregularities were discovered,
they were of the kind to be expected in the
conduct of any large business. They also
respectfully and regretfully reported that the
Bureau's total on page 113 should be $ 78,943.13
instead of $ 78,940.13, etc. They fully expected
that after this vindication the combatantsreformer and accused official-would shake
hands and exchange compliments. Indeed,
nothing further would have happened if the
issue had been one of "goodness" rather than
of efficiency, if the Bureau had not sought
to make the situation intelligible rather than
to bring about a moral upheaval.

The "white-washing" report of the Commissioners of Accounts was not printed in the
newspapers. It was withheld because the

Mayor was confronted with facsimiles of
receipts, requisitions, and correspondence,
taken directly from the books and records of
the Borough President, that disproved the
Commissioners' report. The official experts
were ordered to investigate again and to bring
back the truth and the whole truth. Even
now, when Mr. Ahearn has dismissed his chief
subordinates on the ground that their inefficiency has brought him into disrepute, and when
the deposed subordinates declare that whatever irregularities they committed were committed under orders from the Borough President, there are those in the community who say
that the investigation has been successful only
because of a factional light between the Mayor
and Tammany Hall. It is true that it would
have been harder, and would have cost more to
prove the gross inefficiency of the Borough
President and his subordinates, had the Mayor
thrown obstacles in the way. It is quite as
true, however, that taxpayers have at all times
the right to obtain such information regarding
any inefficient department, and can at any
time secure public condemnation of guilt or
inefficiency, if willing to spend the money and
the time necessary to obtain the facts for
themselves.

But the uncovering of inefficiency or dishonesty is but a small part of the end sought
by the Bureau. Whether any particular
official is removed or not, whether or not
criminal charges are brought against him and
his subordinates, makes relatively little difference. He knows, and all of his subordinates
know, that the same discomfort and discredit
can be brought about again within thirty days
by exactly the same methods, unless inefficiency
is removed or overcome. The reason why this
official is not defiant is that he has lost the chief
asset of the corrupt leader-namely, ignorance
on'the part of the public. Nothing so puts
the standing of any kind of "crook" or
"grafter" in jeopardy among his peers as
"being found with the goods on him." A
less clever man than Mr. Aheam could see
that it would be futile for him to say that there
were no holes in the streets, no perversion of
funds, etc., when he knows that a convincing
refutation would immediately be published by
the Bureau of Municipal Research.

If the Borough President is removed and
a corrupt man takes his place, that corrupt
man will know that unless he installs a system
to prevent inefficiency, he cannot, so long as
