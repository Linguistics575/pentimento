AMATEUR HAND-CRAF'I'S THAT PAY

to express himself, to do freely and with a glad
heart the thing his talent has qualified him to
do. Moreover, if he is half a man, he has
chafed under the system that has hitherto
kept him making day after day the same parts
of the same objects; he wants to make whole
objects, no two alike-to say of a little masterpiece in metal or wood or enamel: "That's
my work, every inch of it, from original design
to finishing touches. It represents my taste,
my individuality, my patience, my skill, my
industry. I had a jolly time making it and
I'm proud of it!" Besides, he has all along
craved emancipation from the cramping tyranny
of the machine. By the limitations that beset
all mechanical devices, it trips up a man's
sudden inspirations and prevents his getting
a hundred pleasing and graceful effects that
would be attainable if he worked with his
hands. So one can easily understand the
hilarity with which a gifted factory operative
achieves his break for liberty. He feels that
at last he has reached his real element.
Nevertheless, he will thank the factory for
the discipline it gave him. Not long ago a
journalistic art-critic described our craftsmen
as a pack of unsuccessful painters, who, having
too little skill to handle the brush, were getting
rich handling tcols. This was clever, perhaps,
but absolutely untrue. When a man has
failed at painting because of slipshod workmanship or lack of a sense of beauty, do you
fancy he will succeed at making exquisite
jewelry, engraving lovely patterns on glass,
carving wood with supreme delicacy, fashioning
wrought iron, or shaping elegantly outlined
vases? Not at all. His sins will find him out.
At painting he had a far better chance to cover
them up, for many a bad painter can get a
slap-dash effect that will pass for art, whereas
no craftsman can deal in humbug without
showing himself a cheat and a bungler. Time
was, of course, when people stood in holy awe
of hand-made objects, thinking it pious to
praise curly plates and hump-backed jugs.
Happily, that day is past. At present only
the most deft and able workmanship gets
recognition. And yet, as sometimes happens,
a painter fails less through want of skill than
through adaptation to that particular form of
art. Having clever fingers, a true eye, and
conscience enough to turn out a square job
every time, though meanwhile devoid of unusual imaginative powers, might he not associate himself with a designer and execute the

splendid plans conceived by his colleague?
I do not hear that any disappointed artists
are doing so, but perhaps that is because they
have too exalted an opinion of themselves.
It looks like petty work, making salt-cellars
and paper-weights, after plating so granclly
of art with a capital A. However, it is a
finer thing, I take it, to excel in small matters
than to "lizzle" in great.

A gentleman revisiting his native town after
an absence of twenty years met an old acquaintance, who, when he left, had just set out for
Paris to study with the best French masters.
"How about your career?" asked the returned
native; "you're an artist now?" "Yes, and
no," laughed the other; "my pictures were
frights; I don't mind confessing it; but I'll tell
you this, old chap: I can paint wagons with
any man within a radius of a thousand miles!"
That was sound, sane, courageous philosophy.
Hosts of starring artists might profit by cutting their flowing tresses and adopting it.

If a possible resource for unsuccessful
painters, the delightful handicrafts are an
actual resource for successful artists. Mr.
Hermann Murphy, for instance, has already
distinguished himself as a framc-rnakcr-the
best, unquestionably, in America. He originates his own designs and executes them with
masterly skill. The revenue from his career
as an artisan helps to finance his career as an
artist. And this I say without suspicion that
Mr. Murphy will resent the disclosure. To
every artist comes the question of a livelihood,
which question remains harrowing and insistent long after reputation and position have
been attained. There is not at present an
adequate market in America for paintings,
nor an adequate public for our painters.
They must supplement their incomes somehow, or suffer: why not by employing their
artistic genius in the production of objects of
use? There is good precedent for so doing;
many a famous artist (among them Benvenuto
Cellini and Quentin Matsys) did not disdain
the humbler modes of expressing their devotion
to beauty but left behind them a fine array of
handicraft products. Meanwhile, the making
of things other than painted eanvasses tends
to contribute to a man's ability to paint. It
cheeks his leanings towards a sham impressionism, forces him to be accurate, becomes
an unsparing critic of his workmanship by
showing him just where he has succeeded and
just where he has failed.
