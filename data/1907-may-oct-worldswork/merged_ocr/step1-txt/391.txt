MEXICO AT
deliver a consignment of invading regiments
at that point.

There is one gigantic enterprise now nearing
completion that will turn nearly every wheel in
the valley of Mexico within a radius of 200
miles. As a colossal hydro-electric proposition
it is of especial interest Also, it is one conspicuous example of the foreigner's faith in
Mexico, being the largest single investment of
capital outside of railroad building. The sum
is $ 31,000,000, and this sum comes, not from
the United States, but from Canada. The investor is the Bank of Montreal. Its representatives
appeared in the sleepy old one-horse-car town
of Puebla with $ 6,000,000. They gave that
town electric light, electric power, and trolley
cars. Then they went to the capital, and
bought the street-car system for $ 11,250,000.
They bought the lighting plants, and cut rates
in half. They could cut rates because they
had cheap power that was costing them the
balance of the millions. This power comes
from the Necaxa waterfall, ninety-five miles
away. In the dry season Necaxa shrinks from
a roaring cataract of 3,000 cubic feet a second
to a feeble, trickling brooklet. To make the
average good the year round, the Canadians are
walling up three great valleys. Six thousand
men are now at work on one of the dams, which
alone will cost a million dollars.

Since the mountains were stripped of their
forests, the cost of coal has stifled industries
in this region. But the Canadians count on a
manufacturing boom. They expect to market
the full 200,000 horsepower capacity of the

Necaxa falls. The big stamp mills at the El Oro
mines, 200 miles distant, are now run by power
from the falls, and ores are handled 2 5 per cent.
lower in value than could be handled before.
The goo-mile line of transmission is said to be
the longest in the world from a single powerhouse. The company is delivering thousands
of horse power to the larger cities. Thirty
thousand will soon be available for Guadalajara, and 50,000 in the capital.

Another striking instance of hydro-electric
power and its vitalizing effects is that of the
old deserted mining camp of Guanajuato.
This camp, worked by the old Spaniards, has
produced $ r,3oo, ooo, ocxo in gold and silver;
