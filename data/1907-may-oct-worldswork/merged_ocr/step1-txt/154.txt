In the first three decades succeeding the
Civil War, little progress was made. In the
fourth decade the tide turned, and things are
now going better than at any time preceding,
before or since the war. This may be shown
by the following general facts about the production and price of cotton per annum in the
four decades succeeding the war:

In first decade 2r50o,000 bales, at 24 cents a

pound, yielded......... ............ $ 300,000,000
In second decade 5,000,000 bales, at 12 cents

a pound, yielded......... .......... $ 300,000,000
In third decade 10,000,000 bales at 6 cents a

pound, yielded m--------------...... $ 300,000,000
In fourth decade 10,000,000 bales, at 12 cents

a pound, yielded......... .......... $ 600,000,000

Formerly the cotton crop was, in the cotton
area, practically the only source of money
income. This one source brought $ 300,000,000.
Now the income has increased until the following figures show, roughly, something of the
improvement:

The cotton crop now yields......... ..... $ 600,000,000
Cotton-seed oil product......... ......... $ 100,000,000
2,000,000 bales of cotton manufacturer-en
hanced value over the raw cotton - $ 200,000,000

Perishable farm products not salable before,
for lack of local markets and transportation facilities......... ............ $ 100,000,000

t. $ 100,000,000





Total for cotton crop and kindred industries,

including truck farming to supply fac
tory operatives......... ......... $ r, ooo, ooo, ooo
Former total income......... ............ $ 300,000,000

Annual increase w-------- .--..--.--...--- $ 700,000,000

Besides this increase in the value of cotton
and what is made out of it over and above
what used to be, there are other gigantic values
being realized in the South; and other kinds of
maufacturing from mines. Coal, mineral oil,
furniture, iron, and steel, and many other
interests have come from absolutely nothing
to be giant interests; and, if the annual values
in these be added, the figures become wellnigh incredible.

The South has practically a monopoly of
cotton. It is not indigenous to the United
States, and it seems quite extraordinary that
it has been developed outside its indigenous
territory to give the greatest and cheapest
supply of raw material for clothing for the
people of the world. While cotton is indigenous
to most tropical and sub-tropical countries,

THE SOUTH'S VAST RESERVES

none of those countries produces an approximately reliable supply. It has been said
that the reason for this is, that where cotton is
indigenous the cotton-destroying insects survive the winter and destroy the crop. In the
cotton area of the United States, the winters are
cold enough to kill the bugs which destroy
cotton and yet the summer is long enough,
taken together with a mild spring and fall, to
permit the growth of a crop. No similar
climatic conditions seem to have been found
in any other part of the world. Therefore,
until some other area with similar climatic
conditions is found, the South will remain
secure in the practical monopoly of cotton
production.

LOW-GRADE ALIENS NOT NEEDED

While more people are needed both for the
production of cotton and in general manufactures, it is not desired that the gates shall be
opened wide to immigration of alien stocks. It
is better rather to maintain a degree of scarcity
of labor to stimulate fair prices-high enough
to maintain better standards of living for working people. This condition of a degree of
scarcity of labor would also stimulate the adaptation of natural forces, such as water power, to
do much work. Immigration is needed in a
moderate tide, and of the best blood only, in
order to bring a new strain into the home blood
and to help tide over the pressure for labor now,
pending the development of natural forces
and their adaption to the work to be done.

The South has had ample experience with
cheap, ignorant labor. Slave labor was both
cheap and ignorant. While it was depended
upon, the natural forces and resources, excepting only the fertility of the soil, remained
untouched. To get full values from these,
each succeeding generation must be better
trained and more highly educated.

The movement for education and training
that is higher and better is already well inaugurated. Practically every Southern state
has established and maintains an agricultural
and mechanical college.

This is wholly apart from the state universities. These technical and practical schools
are well attended by the boys. So also are the
new state normal and industrial schools well
attended by the girls. The public school system of every Southern state is being broadened
and extended. These educational movements
include provision for colored people.
