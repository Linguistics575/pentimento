CITY GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

local highways. His food and fuel, and the
materials of his clothing and of his shelters
come to him from afar on steel tracks or over
the trackless ocean. In short, his real interests
are, in the majority of cases, not at all local
in the old sense, and with every decade they
grow wider and wider. When the former
local interests thus broadened, the old idea
of local representation by wards or districts
became absurd and, like all absurdities in
government, whether survivals or novelties, bred
mischiefs.

TAX-PAYERS SHOULD BE THE TAX-SPENDERS

In the New England town governments the
entire adult male population exercised an active
control over the amount of taxes to be raised,
and the objects for which public money should
be spent. Having determined these points, they
left to a small board of Selectmen the entire
administrative business of the town. This was
the wisest and most successful mode of democratic government ever organized. Compare
with it the condition of an urban population
to-day in regard to the raising and expenditures
of taxes. In the first place, in most American
cities, the people who determine what the taxes
shall be are not the main body of the voters-far from it; secondly, the body of taxpayers on
property do not determine, as in the New
England town, how the money raised by taxation shall be spent; on the contrary, the number
of resident individuals who pay taxes on property is almost always less than half the number
of legal voters; so that the control of expenditures is in the hands of resident individuals
who pay no taxes on property. In making
this statement, non- resident taxpayers, and
corporations and firms which, as such, have no
vote are of course excluded. Considering the
importance which was" attached I40 years ago to
the doctrine, "No taxation without reprieseiita'tion," it is a singular condition which confronts
urban populations in the United States, a condition in which the taxpayers have been deprived of every adequate control over the
expenditure of the taxes they have paid. Of
course, this condition of things tends strongly
to public extravagance, because the nontaxpaying voters believe that their interest lies
in heavy public expenditures, since they like
the fruits of expenditure and suppose themselves to make no direct contribution to the
bearing of the public burdens. They will
naturally. elect agents of their own sort. This

is the root of much municipal incompetency
and wrong-doing.

Another very serious difficulty in municipal
government is the inadequate size and irrational
boundaries of the municipal unit for taxation.
This difficulty has been obviated in some
measure in some localities by the process of
annexing large suburban areas to the city
which is attracting a growing population. There
still remain, however, many instances in which
numerous separate municipalities occupy an
area which ought to be unified for all municipal
purposes and for taxation. Thus, in Boston
and the vicinity, the community has learnt that
it is impossible to provide and carry on satisfactory water systems, sewer systems, and
park systems through the independent action of
thirty different municipal organizations within
eleven miles of the State House; and accordingly separate metropolitan commissions have
been organized for these purposes. The community has also learnt that it is impossible
properly to regulate public-franchise corporations by separate municipal action, each municipality working only within certain narrow geographical boundaries which the corporations
transcend. The state has therefore been called
upon to provide such supervision. There are,
however, other municipal departments in which
the crying need of procuring unity of operation
has not yet been recognized, as, for instance,
in the fire departments, police departments, and
schools. For each one of these departments a
metropolitan administration is urgently needed,
the present heterogeneous and dislocated administrations inevitably producing both waste
and injustice. It is not too much to say that
no just method of taxation can be devised to
cover the three objects of expenditure just
nientioned without enlarging the unit of territory for taxation. The consolidation of different municipalities will generally effect striking economies and also produce increased
efficiency. Thus, when two contiguous municipalities maintain separate fire-departments, and
a fire occurs near the dividing line, it is not the
dozen nearest engines which rush to that fire;
the near-by engines of one municipality arrive
quickly, but the far-off engines of the same
municipality, coming from a considerable distance, of course arrive late and leave without
protection the distant regions where their
houses are situated. Meantime, there were
plenty of engines within easy reach just across
thtlineyof the second municipality Wherever
