over $ 100,000,000 cash in the next five years
to enable it to handle the traffic of the South,
and to properly assist the development of the
resources of the South. At this present
moment the states most intimately concerned
have blazoned upon their statute books the
fact that capital invested in the South is capital

endangered, is capital that must be prepared,

to fight for its life against the open hostility
of the people of the South!

Let us compare this attitude with the attitude of Canada, for instance. In England,
the Southern Railway seeks to persuade the
English investor-lose purse is long-that
the South is worthy of his consideration as an
investment field. The bankers point out the
rich resources of that region, but half-developed.
They talk of cotton, and of iron, and coal,
and lumber. They dare not talk of the fate
of those who threw their millions into the
South in other days. England knows full
well that at this moment, in the midst of a
period of unbounded prosperity, the dividends
on Southern Railway preferred stock are
trembling on the verge.

Against these bankers in the English market
compete the backers of the Canadian Pacific,
the Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk,
a hundred other smaller companies, railroad
and otherwise, designed to open the provinces
of Canada. They, too, talk of resources, of
wheat and ores and lumber. When they
exhaust that line of argument, they clinch it
by a statement, uncontroverted, that the people
want the railroads; that the people cooperate
with the railroads; that the railroad commission of Canada is composed of men whose
private incomes are immense, and that that
commission has never been suspected of undue
preference for the railroad against the people.
It merely stands as the personification of justice,
of cooperation between the people and the
railroads.

The result is that the railroads of the South
are coming to be beggars in the markets of the
world. The railroads of Canada have but to
ask, and the purses of the nations are emptied
for their needs. The burden of it falls upon
the railroads and their investors to-day, but
it will fall upon the people of the South before
many years have passed.

In the face of these conditions, a few brave
men are building up great systems in the
South. The leaders in the railroad development of that region at this time are Messrs.

THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH

J. P. Morgan, Henry Walters, B. F. Yoakum,
and, perhaps, Thomas F. Ryan. The right
hand of Mr. Morgan in the South is Mr. W.
W. Finley, president of the Southern Railway.
Mr. Walters is himself in command of the
Atlantic Coast Line, which also controls the
Louisville & N ashville. Mr. Yoakum is also
on the firing line, as chairman of the Rock
Island, which controls the St. Louis San
Francisco. Mr. Ryan, in cooperation with
Messrs. Blair & Co., of New York, is seemingly
waiting his time to begin the revival of the
Seaboard Air Line.

These great systems are doing little building
except what is absolutely necessary. The
Southern has let contracts calling for the double
tracking of the line between Charlotte, N. C.,
and Atlanta, Ga., within five years. It has
a line projected to extend.eighty miles in North
Carolina, another of twenty-five miles in
Kentucky, another of about forty miles in the
same state, and a small line in South Carolina.
All these can be, and probably will be, postponed if the company cannot raise new money
during the current year without destroying its
credit.

Mr. Walters's railroad system is wealthy.
At the present time, the Atlantic Coast Line
has but one important extension, a new line
to run from Newberry, Fla., northwest about
seventy-five miles to Perry. About twenty
miles of this have been built. A forty-mile
extension in North Carolina has been proposed,
but nothing has been done toward building it.

"We want to know more about North Carolina legislation," said an official to me, in
discussing it.

The Louisville and Nashville is revising its
grades on important divisions, this work covering perhaps a little more than 100 miles of
the system. It has only a few miles of branch
road planned for building, and most of it is
merely spur track to reach various industrial
plants.

Mr. Yoakum is the most indefatigable
railroad builder in the South, but he confines
the most important of his activities to the
western section, rather than the eastern. His
roads have no important projects east of the
Mississippi. There are half a dozen important
roads to be built by these systems if the time
should ever come when the credit of the companies can stand the strain of financing new
enterprises on a large scale.
