9126 A TOWN
Montgomery's idea to establish on these wild
lands a Negro colony, and his plan was heartily
seconded by the officers of the railroad. In the
spring of 1887, accompanied by a civil engineer, he made a personal inspection of these
lands and finally located a site for the present
town on the line of the railroad 104 miles south
of Memphis and 116 miles north of Vicksburg.

Twenty years ago, this whole region was
wild and inaccessible. The country was covered with a heavy hardwood forest, which
united with a dense undergrowth of briars
and cane to make a dense jungle, through
which it was only possible to thread one's
way by the use of a magnetic needle,
cutting the path as one proceeded. Through
this semi-tropical jungle, the railroad had
blazed a wide furrow for a distance of 200
miles from Memphis to Vicksburg, along
which were scattered a few straggling villages,
with here and there a larger town.

One morning in the fall of 1887, a northbound train stopped in the midst of this wildeiness, a party of Negroes stepped off, and the
train went its way. The leader of the group,
a small, slender man, with strongly marked
features and a deliberate and thoughtful manner, held in his hand a plot, which he looked
at from time to time. This was Isaiah T.
Montgomery and the men with him were the
first contingent of prospective settlers.

It was not easy, as I have often heard Mr.
Montgomery say, to find settlers in that early
day. The task of taming this wild country
seemed hopeless to men with so few resources
and so little experience. On this particular
morning, Mr. Montgomery thought it best to
make a little speech before proceeding with
the work that had brought them thither.

"You see," he said, waving his hand in the
direction of the forest, "this is a pretty wild
place." He paused, and the men looked
hesitatingly in the direction he had indicated,
but said nothing.

"But this whole country," he continued,
"was like this once. You have seen it change.
You and your fathers have, for the most part,
performed the work that has made it what it is.
You and your fathers did this for some one else.
Can't you do as much now for yourselves?"

The men picked up their axes and attacked
the wilderness. The idea of the thing got
hold of the minds of some of them, so they
went back home and prepared to return and
take up the work of pioneers. It was not

until February, 1888, however, that the first
permanent settlers moved in. A month later
the ground was cleared sufficiently to set up a
small store. Two dwellings were also erected.
A few of these early buildings may still be seen
in remote corners of the community. They
were constructed of the materials at hand,
walls of rough-hewn logs, roofed with a sort
of shingle split with an axe from hardwood
blocks.

There was, of course, no land to be cultivated when the first settlers arrived on the
scene and no crop-lien system to provide in
advance for provisions until something could
be earned from the land. But the railroads
needed cross-ties for their constantly extending
lines. Timber agents came along in search
of stave-bolts and spoke-material. This gave
the settlers a chance to earn something while
they were clearing the land. In this way the
colonists solved the problem of living off the
wilderness while they were engaged in subduing it. At the end of three years they had
located and purchased 4,078 acres of land and
had cleared and made ready for cultivation
some 1,250 acres. They had earned during
this time $ 8,780 from their timber operations
and had raised 379 bales of cotton and 3,045
bushels of corn on the 65 5 acres of land which
they had cleared.

The wilderness had become the frontier.
The colonists came in faster now. The ragged
outline of the forest steadily receded in all
directions and large areas were opened for
cultivation in the surrounding territory.

THE GROWTH OF THE COLONY

It was not the ordinary Negro farmer who
was attracted to Mound Bayou colony. It
was rather an earnest and ambitious class
prepared to face the hardships of this sort of
pioneer work. The scheme was widely advertised among the Negro farmers thoughout
the state and drew immigrants from all parts
of Mississippi, and a certain number from other
states. Some of the most valuable settlers in
the community came from the "white-capping"
counties in the southern part of the state. No
doubt, the fact that the men who settled Mound
Bayou are a select class has been an important
factor in its success.

After twenty years of existence, Mound Bayou
colony numbers about 800 families, making
a total population of some 4,000 persons.
