blocked by the inability to secure titles to the
necessary lands, but this obstacle has at last
been cleared away.

In 1898 there were about 500 alleged schools,
conducted in rented rooms, supervised by local
boards, some of whose members could not

The teachers were far behind the times, were

the children. On two opposite walls were Crucifixes..

Two male teachers were in charge of the school....

The children were all clothed."

Four years later, the superintendent of the
San Juan district made the following report of
a public school in the same locality; it tells
the story of the education of to-day:

"The new Emerson School, on Cruz Street, San Juan,
of 9 rooms was opened on time, fully equipped.
Each room is furnished with modern pupils' desks, teacher's
