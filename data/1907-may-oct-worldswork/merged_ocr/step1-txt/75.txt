A CROSS-FOX AWAITING THE COMING OF THE EXECUTIONER

always be a favorite of fashion; but the chinchilla that comes from the cool mountain
heights of Bolivia is just as superior to the
chinchilla that comes from the valleys of Peru
and the La Plata as the dark-brown beaver of
the far North was superior to the light-yellow
beaver that used to be found along the salt
lakes of Nevada and Utah. In fact, the first
requirement for good fur is cold; the second,
fresh water in preference to salt, which fades
the furs; third, shaded woods in preference
to the blazing sunlight of the plains.

BEAVER, CHINCHILLA, SABLE, AND ERMINE

Beaver needs no description here. Every
school child knows that the exploration of
North America followed the trail of the little
beaver and that, like the buffalo and the fur
seal and the sea otter, it has yearly grown
scarcer. Will it, too, become extinct? I do

not think so. The Government of Canada,
where the beaver thrives best, has taken steps
to protect it, though a closed season in the true
sense there can never be-for the simple reason
that the Indian treaties stipulate that the Red
Man shall have the right to hunt as long as
"the streams flow and the sun rises." But the
white trader can discourage the Indian hunter
from taking beaver out of season or killing
the mothers.

Chinchilla is the finest fur of South America,
just as the silver fox is of North America; but
just as beaver was the staple of North America,
so nutria is the staple fur of South America.
Half a million nutria skins a year come to New
York alone from Brazil. And oddly enough,
a heavy piece of nutria could easily be mistaken for a light piece of beaver. The difference is in the heaviness and natural curl and
gloss of the beaver.

Both nutria and beaver
