south of Mason and Dixon's line which have
been declared eligible under the provisions of
the Carnegie Foundation. Its executive head
is President William G. Tight, an energetic
educator who came originally from Ohio. Dr.
Tight is a prominent geologist and geographer
and was recently president of the Cordilleran
section of the Geological Society of America.
His originality made a practical and artistic use
of his research work when he conceived this
pueblo idea.

The largest of the new buildings already completed, the women's dormitory, is called "Hoko-na" ("The Butterfly"), the Sikyatki symbol
for maiden. The men's dormitory, a trifle
smaller than the other, is called "kwa-ta-ka"
C Man-eagle"), after a legendary monster who
lived in the sky and harried the people of Siky
atki until their war-god killed it. On the
facades of the buildings have been painted conventionalized likenesses of "Ho-ko-na" and
"kwa-ta-ka," copied from the mural decorations which once adorned the walls of Sikyatki
and from designs on pottery dug up from its
ruins.

Each building is equipped with electric lights
and all modern conveniences, has commodious
suites, and is provided with furniture and interior fittings carrying out the Indian idea as far
as possible. The dormitories are strongly built
of brick and covered with a coat of rough cement that exactly counterfeits the stone-adobe
construction of the original pueblos. Bricks

made of adobe or sun-dried mud, as well as
stone blocks, were used by the inhabitants of
Sikyatki and their neighbors.
