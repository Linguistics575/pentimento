TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS
IV. HIS WORK IN THE PHILIPPINES

BY

EUGENE P.

N 1900, JR.

at the head of the Philippine Commission,

whose task it was to inaugurate civil
government among 6,500,000 Asiatic Christians, 1,500,000 Mohammedan Moros, and a
million other fractious pagans, including the
untamed hill tribes. They had been fighting the
Spanish down through the centuries, and lately
had commenced with us where they had left off
with Spain. And it was our task to substitute
a civil government (and partly autonomous at
that) for the martial government then stalking
them to their lairs in jungles and mountains.

About this time President McKinley and
Judge Day, Mr. Taft's former associate on the
Circuit Bench, happened to be traveling together on the same train. The President
made known his desperate need of a colonial
executive; he wanted a man who was "strong,
honest, and tactful." Judge Day turned with
the remark:

"You have described Judge Taft."

Mr. Elihu Root, then Secretary of War, was
of the same opinion, and Judge Taft was invited to come to Washington.

"Why," in effect exclaimed the astonished
Judge on hearing the offer, "I am not the man
you want. To begin with, I have never approved of keeping the Philippines."

The President said that such had not been
his desire either, but. that the obligation had
been forced upon us and we could not shift the
responsibility.

Judge Taft accepted the appointment on
the Commission with reluctance, for it meant
that he must give up the work of his life, of
which he had grown so fond. But he is afflicted,
often to his own disadvantage, with what
President Roosevelt describes in him as "a
willingness to bear responsibility." Some of
his friends may have perceived in this the
stepping- -stone to a higher national prominence,
but he himself viewed the appointment in a
different light,

IN 1900, President McKinley wanted a man

"I want to do those people good," he said
earnestly.

In two years, he calculated, his work on the
Commission would be ended; he could then
return to simple citizenship and earn for his
family the competence he had so long neglected.

He and his fellow Commissioners landed
at Manila in the sweltering June of 1900. They
had come to win the confidence of natives who
had learned not to trust their rulers. Messages
of good-will weighted the baggage of the Conv.
missioners, but the Filipinos had little faith in
them. The Filipinos were fighting just then,
it should be remembered. There were daily
skirmishes in the brush, and. we had a large
army scattered over the islands. The authority that welcomed the Commission was a Military Governor, Major-General MacArthur.
And yet, hardly had Commissioner Taft's foot
pressed the Oriental soil, with the little brown
men crowding around, when he called them in
to help him solve their problems.

"We invite suggestions from the Filipinos
and all others who have sympathy with our
purpose," he said. "We are here to do justice
to the Philippine people and to secure to them
the best government in our power, and such a
measure of popular control as will be consistent
with the stability and security of law, order,
and property."

This was one of the messages of good will.
But the Filipinos stretched the phrase "a
measure of popular control" beyond all
reason. A peace banquet was arranged by
them, not only in honor of the Commission's
arrival but also on account of an amnesty proclamation just issued by General MacArthur.
At this oratorical fiesta one Pedro Paterno was
to speak. Pedro had already had inscribed
upon the triumphal arches mottoes which
more than hinted at promises of early independence and it was his plan to compromise
the Commission. Mr. Taft saw the trap and
sent word to Pedro that the Commission could
