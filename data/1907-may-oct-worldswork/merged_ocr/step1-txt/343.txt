TAFT:

because, when he fell, he always fell on his
head.

He used to throw himself heart and soul
into any sport that was on. He liked to go in
swimming, and was a great fellow to play
marbles. In those days one had to "knuckle
down," and a patch of rabbit fur was laid on
the ground as a sort of gun-carriage for the
hand. But "Bill" and his partner started the
custom of aiming the "taw" while standing
up, and thus "Plumping" at the target marbles.
He grew very expert at this, and several
eminent members of the Cincinnati bar can
vouch for it that "Bill certainly did skin us."

YOUNG TAFT'S PHYSIQUE

Very'early in life, even while he was in the
Woodward High School, Taft began to emerge
from his chubby state and solidify into powerful and agile proportions. His chums somehow left off calling him "LU." "Old Bill"
seemed to describe him better, or at least their
own affection for him; "and thereafter, in the
college, on the Bench, in the President's
Cabinet, he has always been "Old Bill" to
those early, loyal friends.

They will tell you that he was never very
active on his feet, and therefore rather too
heavy for baseball. "But he would make a
stab at it. He had the pluck, all right." On
the other hand, he was a formidable proposition at wrestling, and while his enormous
natural strength made him equally so at boxing,
he had not great skill. One of the boys in the
block remembers hitting him once when his
feet were together; "and then," says this old
chum, "Bill toppled over backward like a
marble statue."

As to young Taft's physique, here is another
story of the time of his early manhood. Early
one evening Judge Taft saw two or three of the
Mt. Auburn boys, then young men, coming
past the house; he went out, stopped them,
and began chatting. They were evidently
going somewhere, and their manner impelled
the shrewd old Judge to ask where. They
knew him to be almost austere in his conduct,
but they admitted that they were going to see
Muldoon wrestle. It was the match, by the
way, that made Muldoon the world's champion.
The Judge talked gently to the boys, asking
them if they did not think the theatre where
they were going was an improper place. They
explained that they had no idea of seeing the
performance, but wanted only to see the wrest

ling match. At that the Judge's eyes glowed,
and there was longing in his voice. "Wait,
boys," he said, "until I get on my shoes. Do
you know, I like those trials of strength, and I'd
like to go along with you." But the Judge
did not go. Mrs. Taft probably kept him.

A VISIT FROM JOHN L. SULLIVAN

At another time, the champion, John L.
Sullivan, was in town, and Judge Taft sent for
him. The Judge was a prominent man, and
the pugilist came gladly to his office. Judge
Taft apologized for his odd request, and said
that he had heard so much of John L., and that
he was interested in big physical men. Would
Mr. Sullivan have the kindness to step into
the Judge's private office for inspection? Mr.
Sullivan would, and did so. The Judge,
himself magnificently built, felt over the champion in a sort of awe, as a connoisseur before
an overpowering work of art. At last he
exclaimed:

"Well, sir, you are surely a marvelous
specimen!" And then he added, "But let
me tell you, sir, I wanted you up here to decide
if you're a better put-up man than my son
Will."

"Well?" queried Sullivan, grinning.

"Well," said the Judge, "you'll have to
pardon me, sir, but you are not. My Will is
the better man y'.

It is interesting to know, in this connection,
that Sullivan and Will Taft met in later years,
when one was only an ex-warrior and the
other was Secretary of War. But to quote
from the newspaper correspondent who saw it:

As John L. sat in a chair waiting for his arrival to be
announced to the President, Secretary Taft walked out
of the executive offices. John L. saw him.

"There goes the real goods!" said John L., "a genuine
heavyweight. I want to meet him."

While a newspaper man stopped Secretary Taft, another
beckoned John L. to come forward. With the grace that
he always showed in the ring, John L. passed out his
famous right and caught the Secretary full in the palm of
the hand. But Secretary Taft didn't even stagger. He
looked John L. square in the face and welcomed him.

"How much do you weigh, Mr. Sullivan?" asked
Secretary Taft.

"Well, I'm a lightweight," said Sullivan. "But I
expect I have got you skinned about a block"; and the
former pugilist confessed that he weighed 330 pounds,
while Secretary Taft admitted close around 280.
