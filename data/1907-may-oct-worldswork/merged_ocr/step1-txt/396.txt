development that began forty years ago.
Cotton, for instance, was an insignificant item
then; to-day it is one of Mexico's staple products. The crop this year will almost do away
with cotton importation from the United States;
will be enough, in other words, to feed Mexico's
125 cotton mills, which are themselves yet
another new industry-or rather, a revival of
the old Aztec industry.

Another opportunity much more recent for
Mexico is rubber. Some one discovered not
long ago that rubber could be made from an
ugly, ill-considered desert weed, called guayule.
That discovery brought value to worthless
lands, and more American millions to Mexico.





THE ELEVATOR IN THE



A single rubber company lately purchased
2,000,000 acres of rubber land in Torreon for
$ 3,2 50,000, and now owns four plants in Mexico
for the manufacture of rubber on a large scale.
One factory in Torreon, said to be the largest
in the world for extracting crude rubber, turned
out 300,000 pounds in one month, all of which
was bought by American manufacturers. An
other company contracted to deliver from
600,000 to 1,000,000 pounds during the year.
In a word, Mexico is already one of the large
rubber exporting countries of the world.
Another industry, though by no means a new
one, is the raising of henequen fibre, in which
Yucatan has practically a world-wide monopoly.
