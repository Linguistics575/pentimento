men, suitable men were found to do the
work, although all the circumstances were
adverse, the city being nearly bankrupt. In
Boston, the quality of the various commissions
and boards, among which the greater part of
the city business has been parcelled out, has
been good from the beginning, and still is, and
the work of these commissions and boards is
the best municipal work done in Massachusetts.
Witness the far-seeing plans of the Metropolitan Water Board and of the Metropolitan
Park Commission. So soon as the Boston
School Committee was reduced from twentyfour to five, it was found possible to get five
competent men to do the work; and immediately
the new Committee commanded to a striking
degree the confidence of teachers, parents, and
the public at large. On this Committee of
five there were two Catholics, two Protestants,
and one Jew.

If it be clearly understood that successful men of proved capacity are needed and
wanted for the city's service, able men will be
attracted to the service, just because the standard of the service is set high. There are always
plenty of good candidates for offices with which
go power, responsibility, and public consideration. To an office which requires for the proper
discharge of its duties a high degree of intelligence and public spirit, public-spirited men,
young and old, will aspire. Elderly men who
have already succeeded in their business and
become pecuniarily independent will take office
because they find in public duties a new interest,
and a new incentive to exertion. Younger men

of high capacity will take office, because
they believe that in public office they will
have an opportunity to show to advantage what
their quality is, and that this demonstration
will be useful to them in other large affairs,
either public or private. That aldermen and
common councilmen have fallen into contempt
is a grave misfortune; for that very fact makes
it extremely difficult to recruit those bodies
with desirable citizens, except indeed in an
occasional and spasmodic way. Large school
committees, which were until lately the
rule in American cities, fell into disrepute
because election to them came to be considered
a first step for aspiring politicians. It will
be quite impossible to re-constitute the boards
of aldermen and the common councils with a
more effective and respected class of citizens;
because those boards have in many cases lost
the greater part of their powers, and with their
powers they have lost the sense of responsibility
and the consideration of the public. Whenever
an office is aggrandized, the man of capacity who
really fills the office will set a new standard of
efficient work for the office; hence the economy
of consolidations in financial, manufacturing,
and transportation enterprises. The enlarging
of units of organization is a world-wide tendency in all sorts of business; so that the
changes here suggested in municipal government are only another group of instances in
a stream of tendencies. Larger functions in
fewer hands will command the services of
better men-of men honest, efficient, and
public-spirited.

that morning, they had lighted the lamps
in the little police court and one blazed

full upon the place where the prisoners stood.
The justice looked down austerely upon the
woman at the bar; she focused her terrified and
wavering gaze and looked up at the justice.

She was of Stepney; of the crushed tribe
swarming in that frightful region. She bore
the marks of dirt and privation, and yet clearly
she was not from the lowest depths. About
her shoulders was an old shawl, tattered and
faded to a dirty yellow; beneath, a gown worn
and rusty with stains; her bare toes protruded
