9314 WHAT IS A SHOP-GIRLS LIFE?

In one club the girls meet with their
mending and darning, and the girl who has a
shirt-waist or other article of clothing to make
is privileged to call upon her sister members
to help her. Another club whose members are
all department store girls is known as "The
Girls' Musical Club," and is composed of
twenty-five members, who give concerts and
small musical entertainments on Saturday
evenings, to which they invite their men
friends.'

In one of the large department stores an
ambitious little shop-girl started a library some
years ago. Each girl was invited to bring one
book, and for the price of this was given the
use of all books that should come into the
library. The girls soon had a little library,
from which members were permitted to draw
books and keep them out two weeks. As most
of the shop-girls live at long distances from
the place of their employment, they read
on the cars to and from business, and find
the store library a great comfort and convenience.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR' ADVANCEMENT

There is a good chance in the department
store for the ambitious girl to rise and to make
for herself a position of responsibility and
profit in the business. As in nearly all other
kinds of business, there is "always room at the
top," for the capable and conscientious worker.
Women now occupy the positions of assistant
managers, cashiers, bookkeepers, buyers,
superintendents of advertising, and heads of
departments. Most of the girls realize their
opportunities and try to prepare themselves
to grasp them.

"No one knows, who has not been among
them," said a gentle-voiced woman, assistant
manager of one of the large stores, "how
earnest and ambitious most of these girls are.
Many of them, after working all day, go to
night schools to fit themselves for promotion.
I am often surprised at the earnestness and
interest which even the little cash-girls show
in their business. One of our great troubles
is that when the girls are kept away from the
store by illness they generally come back too
soon, before they are really able to resume
business. To girls of that kind promotion is
certain. Women are needed in every department who are keen judges of goods, who have
executive ability, who keep their eyes open and
anticipate the demand of an erratic public

for certain kinds of goods and articles, and
who have new and progressive ideas."

HOW THE SHOP-GIRL LIVES

On their average salary of between seven
and twelve dollars a week, these girls must
live and clothe themselves, and in very many
instances contribute to the support of others.
For it is a fact that there are comparatively
few of this vast body of workers who are not at
least partially responsible for the support of
other members of their families. Sometimes
that means putting practically all of the worker's
salary into the family fund. Yet the girl
who lives at home is fortunate, for love and
confidence and sympathy and companionship
are there. If she does not live at home, it
means for her a hall-bedroom in some cheap
boarding house, or in a rooming house, where
she "goes out" for her meals-and half
starves herself to keep within the narrow
limits of her salary-or cooks indigestible
messes over the gas jet and saturates her system
with debilitating cups of tea.

Living in this way, she can have practically
no social life. She has no place in her tiny
hall-bedroom to entertain company, and if she
meets a man whose acquaintance she cares to
cultivate, her only means of seeing him is to
meet him on the street and carry on the
acquaintance-possibly courtship-in restaurants and on street corners.

A "furnished" room may be had for $ 2.50
a week, but this room is a mere box, containing
an iron bed, a combination washstand and
dresser, and one chair; and has no heating
apparatus but a burner on the gas jet,
upon which the girl may also do her cooking.
Such a room is always on the third or fourth
floor, so that all her water must be carried up
two or three flights of stairs.

A better room, with heat, may be had on the
third or fourth floors for three and four dollars
a week, and a fairly comfortable room for five.
But few shop-girls can pay this price, as the
remainder of their weekly salary would not be
enough to cover food and clothes and car-fares.

THE WORKING GIRLS' "HOMES"

Many shop-girls go to the working girls'
homes and clubs, but they are not happy
there. To a self-respecting young woman who
is working hard to earn her own way in the
world, the attitude of patronage and the feeling that she is being partially supported by
