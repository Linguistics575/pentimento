ducted as to be free of "fads" and above the
suspicion of mere private gain. Along with
this conception of right living and of guarding
against disease, we ought to develop practitioners of prevention, prescribers of modes of
life according to individual needs.

Again, the application to agriculture of the
facts that have been demonstrated over and
over again and that are not yet in general use
would enable many men, perhaps most men,
who now till the soil, to double their yields.
Yet the teaching of the farmers who are themselves now tilling the earth has been hardly
begun. These facts, for example, have been
proved time and again: By the expenditure of
one per cent. more-of $ 101 where $ 100 is now
spent-the dairyman who has common cows
could get a breed of cows that would yield
from 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. more milk or
butter. The same will hold good of wheat-common wheat as against wheat of a good
variety. The labor is the same in each
case.

Most of these tasks require community of
action. T hey require a degree of cooperation
that we have not developed yet. A sufficiently
compact organization and cooperation of society
would enable us to eliminate an enormous
number of economic wastes that we endure only
by reason of habit.

It will become one of the evidences of public
spirit in men and in bodies of men that they
turn their attention to such tasks. The Merchants' Association of New York had not the
slightest idea, when it was organized, that it
would ever consider it a part of its business to
set about the possible extermination of house
flies; and yet it would be hard to find a greater
public service that it could do.

We have hitherto left comprehensive plans
for the practical betterment of groups or communities of people either to the commercial
interests of inventors (a perfectly good method
as far as it goes) or to the impractical and
badly managed experiments of the builders of
Utopias or of "colonies," who have burdened
the real work of betterment with a lot of theories
and doctrines. There is an indefinite field of
work in furthering the practical application
of scientific knowledge for all sorts of organizations. If a great association of merchants in New York think it worth their while
to attack flies, any practical organization of
men or women may find similar tasks near at
hand.

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

THE PHYSICAL CONSCIENCE

IN A noteworthy review of the attention

given to some form of physical culture in
almost all countries, Dr. Richard Cole Newton
says in The Popular Science M onthly:

"In nearly every quarter of the earth, pagan and Christian alike, are to be perceived unmistakable signs of the
approach of a general'physical renaissance such as the
world has only seen twice, or perhaps thrice, and which
preceded the most brilliant periods in the intellectual history
of mankind.' In spite of the lamentations which we so
often hear of the sordidness and vulgarity of modern life,
of the brazen display of wealth and the venality of public
men, there are not wanting signs that the tide is setting in
toward a higher and nobler manhood and a purer, simpler,
and more wholesome life; and not the least of these signs
is the evidence gathered from many different sources that
the physical conscience is again, after slumbering for 2,000
years, awakening and asserting itself, and will rule the
world again as it did in ancient Greece.

"If the coming man will listen to its voice, it will lead him
into'a civilization that will surpass that of Greece by as
much as the present age surpasses that of Pericles in the
solid progress of the sciences and their application to the
useful arts.' "

Some of the facts that warrant this cheerful
outlook are the sane and wcll-balanced attention that all the leading peoples of the world are
giving to physical training for the masses-physical training as a necessary aid to efficiency
and to health. Consider the change in our own
country. Eighty years ago there was not a
college gymnasium in the United States. Today hardly a college can be found without one.
A large part of our cities employ physical
training teachers in the public schools. Even
the Sunday Schools have "athletic leagues."
The attendance at the gymnasia of the Young
Men's Christian Associations in the United
States has increased from 50,000 to more than
I 50,000 in ten years. The same tendency is
shown also in the Young Women's Christian
Associations. Dr. Newton declares that "the
city of Philadelphia alone spends more resources
and employs more agents in the interests of
public health to-day than did the whole Englishspeaking world a century ago." Chicago has
more than 73 acres of playgrounds, Philadelphia 110, Brooklyn 40, Boston 200.

All this is matched and much of it surpassed
in some other countries. In fact, nearly all
modern nations are turning their social and
educational forces in the same direetion-Germany, Sweden, and Japan in particular.

How long it has taken the Christian part of
mankind to recover from the medieval concep
