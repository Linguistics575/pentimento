the temporary and the permanent resources

should be considered separately. Temporary resources are those that lie idle until used,
and whose product is then not income
but converted capital. Permanent resources
are farm lands, water-powers, etc., whose
product is income.

In the list of convertible assets bestowed by
Nature upon the Southern States, mineral
wealth and timber are the two great items.

About one-seventh of the mineral production
of the entire country comes from the Southern

IN forecasting the future of the South,

mineral, the South produces one-fourth; and
of iron, about one-ninth. Its total coal resources amount to nearly 600, ooo, ooo, ooo tons,
or more than one-fourth of our estimated coal

reserve, as follows:
Southern Appalachian Field, including SHORT TONS
West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and
Alabama......... ............ .......... 42 5,8 52,000,000
Southwestern Field, including Indian Territory, Arkansas, and Texas Carboniferous......... ...... .....141,946, ooo, ooo
Texas and Alabama Lignite......... ...... 3o, ooo, ooo, ooo
The showing in iron ore reserves is
quite as good; a safe minimum is over
