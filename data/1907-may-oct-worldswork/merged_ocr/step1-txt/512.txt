least one point from which you may see the
ocean on either side of the island. On days
when the atmosphere is heavy, one may have
the experience of riding through a mist of cloud,
with clouds floating down into the valley beneath him. He need not even lean in the
saddle to pluck the coffee berries growing by
the trail.

One of the first things we did was to pass a
law that made it practically impossible for the
planter to sell his coffee anywhere except in
the United States. And when he brought it
to the United States, we waved him aside with
the remark that his coffee was not up to the
standard of the Mocha and Java which we get
from the Latin-American republics. But a
worse blow came the following year. The
hurricane of 1899, which destroyed thousands
of lives, almost ruined the coffee plantations
-and the coffee bush grows slowly.

It has now been eight years since the hurricane, and the plantations have recovered; but
market conditions have improved but slightly.
The Americans are steadily at work on two
problems-to make two berries grow where
only one formerly grew, and to improve the
quality. That high-grade coffee can be produced in Porto Rico is beyond doubt. Not
even in the French Market of New Orleans
could you obtain a finer brew than some old
Negro woman would serve you in a Porto
Rican market-place in 1898 for two centavos.
This was the ordinary coffee. A dealer in the
coffee district showed me a much finer grade
which he called caracolillo, which was not on
the market. When the American coffee drinker
improves his taste, the Porto Rican planter
will come again into his own.

THE FINANCES OF THE ISLAND

When the Island first became American
territory, the finances of the cities and towns
were in an indescribable condition. Even
in 1901, only two out of the sixty-six municipalities were free of debt. That the prosperity
and progress of the island have been general
is shown by the Treasurer's report. By the
end of June, 1906, all but thirty-five towns
were out of debt and the indications were that
the end of the present year would find not a
single town whose indebtedness was not provided for. Yet they have at the same time
been spending more in public works than they
had spent for decades.

One of the best evidences of the financial

soundness of Porto Rico is given by the sale of
its bonds for building roads. The issue was
for $ 1,000,000 at 4 per cent. Notwithstanding
some unfavorable conditions connected with
this issue, the amount was found to be oversubscribed at a premium, at a time when New
York City fours were selling at par.

ERADICATING THE ONE GREAT DISEASE

To say that the American occupation has
resulted in the introduction of sanitary methods
in the various towns would be to utter a commonplace. The house-cleaning and streetcleaning all the way from San Juan to Mayaguez
were begun long ago. But the most far-reaching work that has been done for the health
of the island is the achievement of Dr. Ashford,
of the Army, and Dr. King of the Marine
Hospital Service, with whom were associated
a number of native physicians.

If you will examine the books on Porto Rico
that were written a few years ago, you will
read that "tropical anemia" was the great
disease of the island and that the high deathrate and low percentage of persons older than
forty-five were due to this impoverishment of
the blood. It was really pitiful to travel over
the island and see the number of pallid, listless
natives; but to the soldiers, this was an evidence either of laziness or of lack of nourishing food. The American doctors began to
make blood examinations and it was soon
found that the island was afflicted with the
"hook-worm" disease-a parasitic affection
of the blood which is infectious. When this
report was made, the insular legislature made
a small appropriation for experiment work;
the next report showed that several thousand
cases had been treated and all but a few
patients had been cured. Larger appropriations and further experiments confirmed all
that had gone before, so the legislature of 1906
set aside the sum of $ 50,000 for experiment
stations for the eradication of this widespread
and debilitating affection. This means that the
stigma of laziness will be removed from the
Porto Rican and there will no longer be the
remarkable difference between the eager,
bright-eyed children and the sluggish, listless
adults that has so often impressed the traveler.

Too many writers have fitted the description
of the various classes of West Indians found in
the coast towns to the native Porto Rican.
It would be just as fair for an Englishman to
describe the inhabitants of a town in the Black
