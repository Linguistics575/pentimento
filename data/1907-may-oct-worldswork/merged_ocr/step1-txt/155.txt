THE RAILROADS' WORK IN THE SOUTH

A PLEA FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE ROADS

BY

W. W. FINLEY

PRESIDENT OP TRE SOUTHERN RAILWAY

the vast natural resources of the Southern

States rightly attracts marked attention.
During the last two decades the progress of
the South has, from an industrial, agricultural,
and commercial Viewpoint, been marvelous.
No section of our great country is advancing
materially with greater rapidity than is the
territory south of the Potomac and Ohio
Rivers.

While much has been accomplished, there
is much more to be done and the people of the
South should unitedly work for its uninterrupted development. The field is promising
for more manufactories and an increased
development of the agricultural interests of the
South. All measures purely antagonistic to
the betterment and increase of transportation
facilities should therefore be discouraged.

Laws favorable to the investment of capital
in railroads are as essential as laws controlling
any other form of property. No other kind
of property has been so potent in promoting
the growth of the country as has the railroad.
Without it, settlement and population would
still be restricted to the ocean shores and interior waterways.

The combined wealth of Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
and Mississippi, as given by the last census, is
not equal to that of Massachusetts alone. The
wealth of New York is three times that of
Massachusetts, while that of Pennsylvania is
more than twice that of the Bay State. The
area of Massachusetts is not half that of any
Southern state named, and in no single resource or particular is it as bountifully favored
as any state of the South. It is, however,
favored with a skilled population busy putting
large values into raw materials from the South
and other states, and it is prospering accordingly.
Very little is heard or said of local restriction
of transportation and manufacturing enter
/ I IHE rapid and substantial development of

prises in Massachusetts and in other rich and
growing Eastern and Northern States, and it is
not probable that any displeasure will be felt
there if oppressive measures are put into force
in the South and West, where recent industrial
growth is affecting Northeastern values.
The South is now in its period of greatest
industrial and commercial growth. There is
room for a still greater growth in both population and wealth. A comparison of nine Southeastern States, in number of persons to the
square mile, with nine Northeastern States of
the Republic, is seen in the following table:

SOUTHEAST NORTHEAST
Kentucky......... ... 58 Rhode Island - 379
Virginia......... ..... 49 New Jersey......... 292
South Carolina 48 Connecticut.

Georgia - 43 New York......... . I 73
North Carolina 42 Pennsylvania.. 155
Alabama i.. 39 Maryland......... .. l 28
Mississippi......... .. 37 Ohio......... ...... 109
Florida......... ..... I I Delaware......... .. 99

The South is now in a critical stage in its
industrial upbuilding. Technical training and
individual and corporate freedom should not
be unnecessarily hampered, or else dominance
will be maintained in sections less favored in
respect to natural resources. Massachusetts
is great because of the union of effort and
harmony among all classes in promoting
industries, and in having labor able to change
cotton into laces instead of jeans, and ore into
needles and pins instead of pig iron. It is
not enough that we have marvelous natural
resources. Through industrial and corporate
and individual freedom, our resources have
been unfolded and our country has won its
crowning place in commerce and manufactures.
In this development the railroad has been
one of the chief factors.

The prominence of the railroad as a factor
in the business of the country naturally attracts
