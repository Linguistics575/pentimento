an awakening nation as it gradually develops
a capacity for self-government-and an ambr.
tion for self-government out of proportion to
that capacity.

Sir Eldon, speaking three years ago, expressed
a fear that the national character was not
developing as rapidly as the country itself.
He was apprehensive that the fruit would be
rotten before it was ripe. The same feeling
is shared by many who have studied the
Egyptian at close range. "Twenty years ago,"
remarked one well acquainted with the native
character, "I thought that it would have been
sufficient to educate them. I was wrong; it
is their entire character which must be altered."

To a lesser degree, the Egyptians themselves
feel this. M. de Guerville, whose recent book
on Egypt is one of the best, says that the
Khedive not only feels his dependence upon
England but prefers its guidance to that of

any other Power. Shortly before Cromer's
resignation, the question of the future was put
direct to the Minister of the Interior, Moustapha
Fehmy Pasha. This was his reply:

"You ask me if Egypt will one day be able
to do without England? That is a delicate
question, and one which time alone will answer.
But this much I can say, that at the present
moment we cannot do without her. The point
has not yet been reached when Egypt can be
left to its own resources."

And so, under favorable conditions, Sir
Eldon comes to his great task-the execution
of a policy that has stood the severe test of
twenty-five years, that has the confidence and
support of the home Government, and that has
the approbation of the leaders of the subject
country. It is the general belief that the reins
of government have fallen into strong and
capable hands. The men picked by Lord
Cromer do not fail.

THE PROJECT OF CAPTAIN EELLS TO MAKE AMERICAN WATERS SAFER

BY

C. H. CLAUDY

HE extreme point of the long, low sand
banks that lie along the eastern coast of

North Carolina is Cape Hatteras. For
many miles on either side, there is not an harbor
in which a passing vessel may seek safety from
the frequent and furious storms of this coast.
Although there is comparatively little coastwise traffic past the Cape, it has exacted on
the average a toll of one vessel every three
months for the last thirty years. There are
life-saving stations every five miles along the
sand-banks, and a lightship is anchored over
the shifting sands of the Diamond Shoals outside the Cape; yet, in spite of these, millions
of dollars' worth of property and many lives
have been lost.

Two attempts to build lighthouses have
failed. In 1905, Congress authorized Captain
A. F. Eells to make another attempt, guaranteeing a payment of $ 750,000 for the light after
it has stood five years. If it proves a failure,
Captain Eells and his associates stand the loss.
In reply to a letter of the Department of Corn,

meree and Labor, seeming to doubt his good
faith in the project, Captain Eells wrote to
Secretary Straus the whole history of his plan.
"More than twelve years ago," the letter
said, "on one winter's afternoon, I received
a telegram from Orleans stating'Your schooner,
the J. R. Eells, is ashore at Nauset, Mass.
Crew not saved.' The schooner had run
ashore on account of having lost her sails in a
heavy snowstorm and gale, she having no mark
to run for to find the channel leading to the
Nantucket Shoals at Pollock Rip, Mass.; it
being a thick snow-storm, the captain-rather
than take his chances in running down to the
entrance to the Shoals-ran the vessel on the
beach in the morning, the only lightship at
that time being placed within the shoals. After
the vessel struck, attempts were made by the
life-saving crew to launch a boat, but failed.
They shot the gun off with ball and line which
passed over the wreck; but, on account of one
man being frozen in the rigging and the captain having slipped down to the cap of the
