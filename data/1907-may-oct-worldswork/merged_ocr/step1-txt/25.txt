OUR GREAT INLAND WATER

so urgent as to form a constant menace to the
money markets of both New York and London.
To get the money, we have over-extended our
credit, both at home and abroad, almost as
badly as we over-extended it in 1893. In
fact, it has several times been near the breaking
point.

The necessity for money has compelled the
railroads to borrow at very high rates of interest, mostly on 5 per cent. notes running for three
years. Half a dozen of the greatest manufacturing companies have found it well-nigh
impossible to borrow money for their needs,
even at these rates, and have practically abarr.
doned the work they meant to do. The railroads also have curtailed their expenses where
they could, cancelling orders for rails which
they intended to use for extensions and renewals, abandoning surveys, and making no
further effort to find men for their labor.

These conditions are strangely like the conditions that preceded the check in the industrial world in 1903. There are, however, a
few comforting differences. The great bankers
of Wall Street in 1903 were loaded with huge
bond issues which they could not sell at any
price. There is no such condition now.
Then the curtailment of orders from the railroads and the consequent check to manufacturing came suddenly and without much warning.
Now, there has been plenty of warning.

Perhaps most reassuring of all is the fact that
the banks, weak as they undoubtedly have
been in surplus, have also for months been
doing their best to set their houses in order.
In consequence, they met the ordeal of March
with a courage and a confidence totally unlike
the timidity that fell upon them at the beginning of the collapse of 1903, and as far
removed as possible from the actual bankers'
panic of 1893.

It is an economic truth that, when the industries and the banks alike have made preparation for curtailment, the curtailment is
likely to pass by, because the very preparation
removes the main causes of economic disturbance. It would not be at all surprising
if the Wall Street "smash" were really the
worst that is to happen, after all. Certainly,
that "smash" has gone far toward relieving
the general situation in the money market,
and some of the best critics are disposed to look
for a period of quiet markets, with money
piling up and industrial strength constantly
increasing from this time on,

OUR GREAT INLAND WATER PROBLEM

HE Inland Waterways Commission,

recently appointed by the President,
has an opportunity to write a report that shall
become one of the greatest practical documents
of our industrial history; for this Commission
has the task of making a unified and comprehensive plan for the improvement and the full
utilization of our river systems. How big and
how important this task is, only professional
geographers and those engineers who have
attacked some of these problems know. There
is already a vast literature on the subject, mostly
technical. There have been hundreds of local,
and some comprehensive, plans made by commercial bodies in the Great Valley; but a
complete study of the whole vast problem has
not been presented in one treatise. Every
reader of Dr. McGee's remarkable article on
the Mississippi River in a recent nurpber of this
magazine got glimpses of the importance,
the difficulties, and the fascination of the
subject.

The water-courses that converge in the Mississippi River are one of the greatest assets of our
country. Enormously useful as they are, even
under our general system of neglect, they are
yet undeveloped and untamed resources.
Transportation by rail has so taken our attention and energies that we have postponed till
now even a careful study of river navigation.
From the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
there are waterways which, if improved, would
admit ships to forty states and reach communities that comprise perhaps 90 per cent. of the
wealth and population of the country. Mr.
J. J. Hill has made the calculation that it would
require the building of nearly 75,000 more miles
of railroads at a cost of $ 5, 500,000,000 to meet
even the present demands for traffic, and that
this same result could be reached if only onefifth of the carrying power of the waterways
were utilized. The products of the interior
states have been doubled in ten years and the
railroads' capacity has been increased only
about 12% per cent. But transportation is
not the only problem that will be solved by a
proper utilization of the rivers. As important
as traffic is, agriculture (the rivers now waste
our lands, for the Mississippi alone carries away
400 million tons of soil a year), and forestry
(the cutting of trees causes floods), and irrigation (for water now runs to waste that could
be made to convert vast dry areas into the
most fertile fields), and water-power (the value
