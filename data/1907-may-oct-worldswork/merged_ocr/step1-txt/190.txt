raised money by public subscription to
have them come. This is, perhaps, the
most important fact yet developed-that

agricultural communities themselves may be
expected to provide for such instruction-at
first, the best-informed and the most energetic
of them. It may follow that such a local
demand will arise as to make this method of
instruction widespread; and perhaps the state
governments and other such agencies will
adopt it. In Texas I heard the work spoken
of as "Knapp's University," and throughout
the region which the demonstrators have covered it is regarded as the best practical help
that agricultural life has ever received.

Such is the simple story that I went to Lake
Charles, La., to get; for it is at Lake Charles
that Dr. Knapp has his headquarters. In his
office, as well as at other places throughout the
South, I met some of the demonstrators,
selected by him to do this work. I saw some
that had worked in Texas, some in Louisiana,
some in Mississippi, and some in Alabama.
Every one talked as if he had found a great
mission in life; every one had a sort of apostolic
zeal and felt that he was leading mankind to a
permanent higher level of prosperity and right
living. You will have to travel a long time
and talk to many classes of men before you
will find such certainty of purpose, such devotion to human betterment, as the best of
these men show. The stories of their work
and the experiences of the farmers whom they
have taught are stories of making two bales of
cotton grow where one grew before, or of three
bushels of corn where one grew before; but is
not that as cheerful a story as there is in contemporaneous history?

Dr. Knapp recently explained the system
of work and instruction in these paragraphs:

"First, the farmer is selected to conduct a simple and
inexpensive demonstration. Second, a contract is drawn
with the United States Department of Agriculture by which
he agrees to follow certain instructions. Third, better
seed is furnished him and his name is published in the
papers. Fourth, each month when the Government's
Field Agent goes to inspect his demonstration many of his
neighbors are invited; consequently, he will almost unconsciously improve his farm so as to be ready for company
and cultivate all of his crops better. Fifth, a report of his
extra crop is made in the county papers. His neighbors
talk about it and want to buy seed. Sixth, he sells the seed
of his crop at a high price; his neighbors ask him how he
produced it; he is invited to address public assemblies, he
has become a man of note and a leader of the people and
cannot return to his old ways. Soon there is a body of

such men; a township, a county, and finallya state is transformed.

It The environment of men must be penetrated and
modified or little permanent change can be made in them.
The environment of the farmer is limited generally to a
few miles. The demonstration must be carried to this
limited area and show how simple and easy it is to restore
the virgin fertility of the soil, to multiply the product of
the land per acre, to increase the number of acres each
laborer can till by three or four fold and harvest a profit
from untitled fields by animal husbandry. This is our
Farmers' Cooperative Demonstration Work."

The accompanying map shows the places
where these men have made demonstrations
in certain counties in northeastern Texas and
in Louisiana, and the following are some of
the reports:

A farmer, Mr. W. H. Miller, of Fairfield,
Texas, wrote last November about the result of
the work done by Mr. Procter, one of the
demonstrators:

"Every man that followed Mr. Procter's instructions
has succeeded far beyond his expectations. I have
doubled my cotton crop on every acre that I planted and
cultivated according to your instructions. I have
been farming for twenty years but I realize that I have
just begun. Farming is in its infancy. We feel like we
have a new lease on life in following your methods."

The same demonstrator reports that in an
area where the weevil had done great damage
in 1903 and where the demonstration work
was done in time to show results in the crop of
1904, the yield was as follows:

YEAR BALES VALUE

1903 1250 $ 62,500
1904 3750 137500
1905 4400 220,000
1906 7500 375,000

Another demonstrator, Mr. H. E. Saveley,
reported last December the bales of cotton
grown about a number of Mississippi towns,
on the same area, as follows:
