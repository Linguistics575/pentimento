The worst "joints" are those which are run for
the benefit of white visitors and white patrons.
We pay too high a compliment to Chinese intelligence when we imagine that he can devise
anything more ingenious or complicated in the
way of vice than we. He gamble, of course,
but fan-tan is his only substitute for the racecourse and Wall Street. In the absence of
family life, he invents all sorts of ingenious
deviltry-just like New York or London clubmen. He smokes a good deal of opium and
probably shortens his life considerably by so
doing, but for some strange racial reason it
seldom makes the abject physical and moral
wreck of him that morphine does of the white
man. So far as I can learn, only about So per
cent. of the Chinese and scarcely 20 per cent.
of the Japanese "hit the pipe" at all. Of these
probably not more than a third do so to excess,
and even they "carry it" surprisingly well.
Unless thoroughly familiar with the symptoms,
you might see a Chinese every day and never
suspect that he was an opium habitu√©. Unlike
Mark Twain's Prospector who "never let his
business interfere with his drinking," the Chinese never lets his pipe interfere with his work-.
until the last few weeks, or months before
the end. He smokes only out of business
hours, or at the end of his week or month,
when he can get a day or two off. it is not

a handsome nor attractive vice, and the only
whites who are led to indulge in it are of the
lowest class.

On the other hand, the great majority of
Orientals either abstain from alcohol or take
it in strict moderation. There are a few saloons
in each Chinatown and they can generally be
picked out by the group of white men hanging
about the door. Of late, the Japanese is showing a little tendency to take kindly to whiskey
as a substitute for his native sake (rice brandy).
Occasionally he will even take enough to become boisterous and come in contact with the
police, which occasions much shaking of heads
and wagging of beards over "steins."

Managers of canneries which have to handle
promptly and regularly every day of the season
large amounts of valuable raw material or have
it spoil on their hands, will tell you frankly that
they prefer Chinese or Japanese to white labor,
because they never get drunk or go on sprees at
critical periods and require no holidays or days
off.

In fine, while the Chinese and the Japanese
have their defects, and the Coast has no desire
to "gush" over them or urge them to become
citizens, we regard them as a valuable commercial factor, and as a race as free from vice or
other drawbacks as can reasonably be expected
of mortals.

EXPLORING THE GUNNISON CAN'ON

ITHIN the mountain-locked Uncompahgre Valley, described on page
9322 of this number by Mr. Arthur W.
Page, lie 2OO,00O acres of rich land fed by
a scanty stream. Taking the gambler's chance,
five had homesteaded the desert wastes where
only one might irrigate his holding. Longingly
they cast their eyes to the eastward, where the
Gunnison River flows along the bottom of a
narrow canon, 3,000 feet below the surface of
the mesa and between walls of precipitous rock.
Engineers glanced at the topography and pronounced the situation hopeless.

Among the settlers was a dreamy Frenchman
-Lauzon by name-who held on to his barren
forty acres. He became convinced that the
Gunnison might be tapped by a tunnel
and infected his fellow-settlers with his belief.

They joined their voices to his and presently
the cry of the desert-dwellers was heard in
Washington. A chief engineer, whose bureau
is devoted to the' performance of benevolent
miracles, sent this telegram to the Denver office
of the Reclamation Service:

"Advise me if it is possible to divert Gunnison
to Uncompahgre Valley by tunnel under
Vernal Mesa."

Mr. A. L. Fellows, the district engineer, read
it and silently pushed it across the table to
Mr. W. W. Terrence, his aide.

"Nasty job for somebody," said the assistant.

"That's me," said Mr. Fellows. "I shall
need a _..-.-."

"That's me," replied Mr. Terrence.

The feasibility of a tunnel can be determined
only after locating both ends of it. In this
case one end must necessarily be in the caiion
