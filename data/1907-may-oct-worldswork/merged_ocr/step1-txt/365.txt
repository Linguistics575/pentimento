would again stand for something definite, even
in defeat. And it will be fortunate if the
Republicans nominate a man who vill fix the
Roosevelt policies as permanent party doctrines.

IS MR. BRYAN'S NOMINATION A FOREGONE
CONCLUSION?

T STILL seems likely that Mr. Bryan
will again be nominated by default--simply because his party has no other man.
Yet very significant protests against such a
policy are appearing in some of the Southern
Democratic newspapers. This, for example,
from the Wilmington (N. C.) If essenger:

"Hasn't Bryan made as much money and as great a
reputation out of his candidacy for the Presidency as did
the man who defeated him? If it is money in his pocket
and increased notoriety to be the candidate, whether elected
or defeated, why should he hesitate at accepting the nomination if it comes to him with assurance of defeat? If
Bryan, the third time defeated candidate for President,
will be a bigger man than Bryan the twice defeated man,
of course he will accept the nomination without regard to
the possibility of election or certainty of defeat."

The difficulty of putting such a protest into
effect is the lack of an available candidate-as
yet. There are two kinds of possibilities.
One is the nomination of such a man as Governor Johnson, of Minnesota, who has been
twice elected, as a Democrat, in a state that
has a large normal Republican majority. He
is a plain, honest, vigorous man, a "son of the
people"; and the suggestion of him is not a
bad suggestion, in spite of the fact that he has
had no experience in national affairs. Mr.
Cleveland had had no experience in national
affairs when he was elected, and Mr. Lincoln
and Mr. Roosevelt had had little. Governor
Johnson is, emphatically a tariff-reformer, and
he woulu stand on the Tilden-Cleveland
platform.

The other possibility is the capture of the
Democratic nomination by Mr. Hearst. Or
is this an impossibility? Let us hope so. Yet
few men thought it possible that the Democratic Party in New York would have such a
fate as to fall into his hands; and, had the
insurance scandals not occurred, which gave
Mr. Hughes an unusual advantage, Mr. Hearst
would probably be the Governor of New York
to-day. An abject party is an easier victim
of the aggressive and unremitting use of money
and of newspapers than men realize in times
ot ovies dignity,.

WHERE OUR WORKING CHARACTER IS
BREAKING DOWN

RESIDENT MELLEN, of the New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad
Company, said a little while ago that, in his
experience, the efficiency of organized labor
had of late years become less as wages had
become higher. This is a startling and discouraging declaration; but it has received confirmation from other men of large experience.
Some careful students of the census tables of
manufactures and wages have declared that
this tendency is more or less general throughout
our manufacturing activities.

But, after all, the cause is not hard to find.
We have been passing through an era of labor
organization when one of the chief purposes
of the unions has been to make of themselves
mainly strong fighting machines. A union card
means that its owner has paid his dues and
will obey an order to strike. It may or may
not mean that he is an efficient workman; and
there is no difference between the card of a
very good workman and the card of a far less
good one. Nor, under the rules of most organizations, has a very good workman a chance to
earn more money than a far less good one.

In a word, the organization of labor has not
been wholly on the basis of efficiency in work
but rather on the basis of loyalty to the organizations. In a sense, efficiency in work,
beyond a certain grade, has really been discouraged.

Another cause of decline in efficiency is the
lack of good training in most trades. The
labor unions have abolished a systematic
apprentice system, and we have yet developed
few trade schools where boys are thoroughly
trained. Thus the lack of thorough systematic training in the first place, and thereafter
the kind of organization which permits skill
of the second grade to receive as high wages
as skill of the first-class, have discouraged
the development of the highest efficiency.

This is a fact that touches the very foundations of American character and of American
progress. It should be a subject of the gravest
concern not only to labor unions, to skilled
workmen, and to the employers of skilled
workmen, but to every class of society. It
means retrogrcssion. It means-to the extent
to which inefficiency has increased-a failure
in our educational and social life.

Mr. Mellen, in fact, only put in concrete
form what the best students of American
