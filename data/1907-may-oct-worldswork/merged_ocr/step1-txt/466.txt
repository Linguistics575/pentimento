He has a mind which can be educated, a hand
which can be trained, ambitions which it is
right for him to strive to realize, and it is the
duty of the public to help him to make the best
of himself, so that he can win light through

short-lived books that the public,
perhaps, is inclined to forget the larger undertakings of the publishing houses. A few of
such large undertakings are, therefore, here

EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY

Of these "libraries," or growing collections
of books uniformly bound, the Evcryman's
Library, issued in the United States by E. P.
Dutton & Company, is one of the most popular
as well as one of the most serviceable. It is
intended that it shall include not only the
English classics but also many books that are
either out of print, or so rare, or so expensive
as to be out of the reach of the everyday reader.
Reprints of such books, well printed and modestly bound, are here offered at a most reasonable price, for each volume. The public
appreciation of this idea has been shown in
several ways; by a large sale, of course, but
especially by the eagerness with which the
books by the more obscure authors of the past
have been bought. The publishers have thus
clearly performed a very real service toward
putting within easy reach thLLt part of English
literature that was hardest to procure.

AMERICAN STATE SERIES

The Century Company is issuing a series,
now eight volumes, of studies of the American
State. These studies are: "The American Constitutional System," by Dr. W. Willoughby,
professor of political science in Johns Hopkins

University; "The American Judiciary," by
Judge Simeon E. Baldwin, Justice of the
Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut and
professor of constitutional law in Yale University; "Territories and Dependencies," by the
Hon. W. F. Willoughby, Treasurer of Porto
Rico; "City Government in the United States,"
by Dr. Frank J. Goodnow, Eaton professor
of administrative law and municipal science
in Columbia University; "Party Organization,"
by Mr. Jesse Macy, professor of political science
in Iowa College; and "Local Government:
Town and County," by Mr. John A. Fairlie,
assistant professor of administrative law in the
University of Michigan. These volumes are
first of all devoted to a description of conditions
as they exist in the United States, but they seek
also to suggest the problems that exist in our
political structure, with the considerations
involved in their solution. The books are sold
at $ 145 apiece.

"LEADING AMERICANS"

A series on much the same subject, but
approached from the angle of the personalities
that have made conditions what they are, is
the series of biographies of Leading Americans,
in course of publication by Henry Holt and
Company. These volumes, of which "Leading
American Soldiers," by Mr. R. M. Johnston,
has been published, will be of large size, and
each will contain several biographies under
such classifications as "Leading American
Historians," by Prof. William P. Trent, of
Columbia University; "Leading American Lawyers," by Mr. Henry C. Merwin; "Leading
American Poets," by Dr. Curtis Hidden Page,
