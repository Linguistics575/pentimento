dollar's worth of business with any "banking"
firm not well established and widely known, or
else a member of a reputable exchange, Because
these firms, even the worst of them, name as
their references good national banks in various
cities-in which banks they deposit small
accounts in order to be able to use the name--all such references must be either ignored or
investigated personally and thoroughly. The
mere statement from such a bank, "Messrs.
So-and-So have an account with us" means
nothing at all, and is not a safeguard but a
pitfall.

The real investor does not deal in wildcat mining shares or wild-cat shares of any sort.
Luckily the bond houses are barely touched
by the infection that has weakened the whole
structure of the stock-investment world in the
past decade or two. It is true that a few of
the big, solid houses have been made mere
depots for distributing fourth-rate and fifthrate bonds to the public in the interests of
two or three big railroads, but in general the
bond business as carried on in Wall Street is
still respectable. In a former article, THE
WORLD'S WORK paid special attention to the
circle of strong and clean houses that make
specialties of bonds of a narrow character
with a view to giving the buyer a large revenue
with good security, but a narrow market.

Let us turn, for a moment, from the general
bond business to the buyer who represents an
estate, who desires perfect safety above all other
things, and who does not care so much about
large revenue. This magazine has received
in the past two months perhaps half a dozen
letters from investors deploring the fact that
such a buyer is exposed to insidious advice
from brokers and bankers in Wall Street, and
finds it hard to satisfy his mind that what he
buys is really as good as they say it is.

In every such case, it has been the advice
of the magazine to limit the purchase to bonds
that are legal for New York savings banks, or
Massachusetts savings banks, except such
bonds as come in under the clause of the latter
law which makes legal certain street railway
bonds. That will be a sufficiently broad field.
In one or two instances, notably the case of the
Chicago & Alton 3 per cent. bonds, there is a
suspicion that this law has been made a-mere
creature of financial jugglery, but even in this
instance no one doubts for an instant that the
bonds will be paid off at par when due, and

will pay interest regularly in the meantime.
The law is strict, and it is generally impartial.

It is not proposed here to publish a full list
of these bonds. Probably such a list would
be furnished by any bond house that does
business of this kind in large quantities. In
any event, the intending buyer can go to the
cashier or the president of his savings bank
and ask a few questions, or he can write to this
magazine at any time. A book is published
giving a full exposition of the New York law,
but it costs $ 15, and is subject to amendment
after each session of the New York legislature.
Another book, also at high cost, outlines all the
laws on this subject in all the states. Trustees
of large estates, private investors of big sums
of money, bankers, and financial advisers of
business concerns that invest their surplus
should have these books, but the small investor
can obtain all the information that he needs
without them.

The point of all this is the fact that the law
has established safeguards in many states that
will absolutely guard the investment of the
people, if the people will only be guided by the
law. The New York Stock Exchange has
thrown yet other bulwarks between the gold of
the people and the pirates of high and low
finance. The strongest of these guards is
publicity, a certain amount of which is required
before a stock can be listed on the Exchange.
Unhappily, the special interests were able
some years ago to get around this to some
extent by getting their stocks "listed in the
unlisted department" of the Stock Exchange,
which is a foolish thing that stamps the Exchange as not at all a perfectly reliable guardian
of the public's welfare.

On the whole, it will be seen that there is no
need for anyone to walk into danger if he use the
proper precaution. If a man will open accounts with firms that he does not know; if he
takes as gospel truth everything that he sees
in advertisements or press notices; if he will
invest in wild-cat stocks in spite of all advice
and warning; if he persists that he knows
more about investments than the savings-bank
committee of his state; if he follows "tips"
on faith alone-if he must do all or any one of
these things, he will continue to be the victim
of the "special speculators," of the sudden
bankruptcy, of the mere financial pirate, or of
the bond house whose stock in trade is a confidence game.
