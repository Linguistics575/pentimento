who had voted for the bill, made 212 members
present, the number required for a quorum.

Counsel for the importers argued that if a
member does not vote, he is not doing business,
and must be regarded as absent.

Counsel for the Government thereupon
wished to know what good could be accomplished by compelling the attendance of absentees if by merely refusing to vote they could
break a quorum.

Well, to be brief, the young lawyer who had
the People of the United States for client won
again. In fact, he won for his august client
every time, and in the most important cases
of that Administration.

During his three years as Solicitor-General,
Taft's newer and higher field of activity exacted
of him a versatility that would have exercised
even a much older legal brain. He had to
advise, and advise safely, all the different
executive departments on all the exasperating
puzzles of administrative procedure. He had
to take in accurate information now by wholesale. And yet he found the time to send long

letters to his ftther, faithfully accounting for
himself and his work as a good steward should.
If his father were satisfied, he could trust the
people, his employers, to be even more so.

As Solicitor-General, Taft had had Opportunities to spend himself, which he did unsparingly, in the indulgence of the passion of
his life-the doing of big things. Still very
young in years, he had done things that were
big nationally. But he had approached them
and mastered them with the simple directness and industry and thoroughness with which
he had learned lessons in school. They were
tasks set before him, and for the time they were
all in all. Yet here in Washington, as at home,
he impressed men as being a power apart from
the immediate thing in hand. This useful
citizen was palpably capable of higher usefulness, and when he returned to Cincinnati,
he returned as he had left, a judge, but now a
Federal Judge, on the Circuit Bench of the
United States; and of a Circuit, too, that had
risen to the habit of graduating its judges to
the Supreme Bench of the Nation.

ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL OR REVERSE THE FORCES THAT BRING OLD AGE

BY
DR. EDWARD A. AYERS

stay the hand of time, but it has dis
covered much that is upsetting to our
ancient ideas on the fundamental causes of
growth and decay, and has even gained some
insight into the possibilities of reversing the life
process, whereby age might grow back to youth.
It is a very fascinating suggestion that man,
by "taking thought," can add a cubit to his
stature, or move back from the shriveling of
age to the bloom and freshness of youth! There
is much nonsense cropping out in the newspapers about the discoveries of such scientists
as Professor Loeb, slight hints being projected
by vivid imaginations to conclusions still far,
far away.

One needs a lot of bottle feeding in the
nursery of science before it is easy to discuss
such ultimate questions as control over advancing age. A host of queries arises: What

is life? What is the process by which a little
cell 1-r25th-inch wide can grow into a big,
complex creature like a man, or an elephant,
or a whale, or a humming-bird, as the case
may be? What is it that causes a senseless,
unconscious bit of life-producing putty-protoplasm-to move? Why do the pale and
sickly shoots growing from potatoes in a dark
cellar reach toward the only light that comes
through the cellar door? Why will entire
limbs grow out from the stumps of amputated
limbs in some forms of lowly animal life, while
man is given but one chance to sue a railroad
for the loss of his leg? What is this seeming
intelligence that causes newly hatched chickens,
with absolutely no experience, to move unerringly to food? Is instinct becoming defined?
What has crystallization to do with life formation? What part in the great drama is
assigned to the activities of bacteria?
