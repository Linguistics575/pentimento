party, under Mr. I. W. McConnell, who is
now project engineer, then made a detour of
150 miles to get to a point immediately across
the river. There they crawled down another
fissure. In one of these gulches they scared up
a band of mountain sheep. In this way the
river survey was made, some of the desccnts
being accomplished by the use of ropes over
cliffs hundreds of feet in height. The work
had to be extremely accurate, for a very small
mistake in so long a tunnel would result in a
failure of the two ends to meet.

The building of the tunnel was at first under,
taken by a private construction company, but

it gave up the contract. It was a much
larger job than anyone had supposed. The
Government engineers took over the work,
and they have made records which are believed
to be unsurpassed. In the west tunnel 809
feet were excavated in one month; an average

and 8,500 feet were removed in a year.

The work has presented great difficulties.
(The famous Hoosac tunnel is the only longer
one in the United State.) In the west end the
workers tapped a subterranean stream and a
cavern charged with carbonic-ucid gas which
drove everyone helter-skelter out of the heading. The ventilating machinery was turned
off until the How subsided, when operations were
resumed. But the engineers soon found that
the tunnel was too hot and that it could not be
properly ventilated, so a new shaft more than
four hundred feet deep had to be sunk to ventilate the heading. This took three months of
hard work without a foot of progress in the
tunnel itself. They have struck other gas
veins and subterranean streams, cut through
treacherous water-bearing gravel, through a
small vein of coal, and through goo feet of a
