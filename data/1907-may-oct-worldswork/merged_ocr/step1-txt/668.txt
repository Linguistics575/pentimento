northeast, both thriving markets. The foothills are covered with forests of the finest
hardwood, and the standing timber on this
island is probably more than double that of
the states of Washington and Oregon.

In view of the fact that American railroads
already find it necessary to draw on Japan for
their ties, it is not at all improbable that
Philippine hardwood will carry the rails of
our American systems within the next five
years. It is practically impossible to carry on
lumber operations on an ordinary scale; logging
by water is out of the question as the streams
are rapid and erratic in flow. Then, too, the
native woods are so heavy that each log must
be lashed to bamboo floats. Conservative
estimates of the standing timber place the
stumpage value to the Government at nearly
three billion dollars.

At Escalante is one of the finest land-locked
harbors in the Archipelago; when dredged, it
will afford a deep anchorage for a dozen oceangoing steamers.

Negros also produces large quantities of hemp
of the best grade. The population is not as
large as that of Panay and the railroads must
depend for a large portion of their revenue upon
freight receipts. The passenger traffic on the
Panay roads will be heavy from the beginning.

Cebu, a long narrow island to the cast of
Negros and separated from it by the Tanon
Strait, has about half of its eastern coast served
by a trunk-line terminating at Danao on the
north and Argao on the south, with a branch
from Carcar running across the island to
Julugao, a seaport on the Strait. Cebu, on
the main line, has a fine natural harbor, which
has been dredged and improved by the Govern,
ment. All along the east coast of this island
are coal lands of undetermined extent, forming--in the estimate of many-one of the most
valuable assets of the Archipelago.

Practically all of the coal now used in the
Philippines is Japanese coal from Nagasaki, or
Australian coal, which costs more than $ 6 gold
at Manila. It is not improbable that coal can
be mined on Cebu at such a cost that it can be
landed at Manila for $ 4.50 a ton. This matter
of native coal is of great importance on account
of the naval coaling station which the United
States Government is now building at Olongapo,
on Subig Bay. Most of the coal now used by
the fleet in the Far East comes from the United
States via Suez. V

the islands, and nearly half of the entire railroad
system will be in the shape of additions to the
existing Manila and Dagupan Railroad. From
Manila the railroad runs in a northerly direction
to Dagupan, also a seaport. From here the
road skirts the coast to San Fernando, where
a steamer connection is contemplated. From
Manila southward a trunk-line will be built
to Pagailao, following the shores of the lake
known as Laguna de Bay. Several short spurs
are being built into the richer territory, tapping
tobacco and other agricultural lands. In the
extreme southern end of Luzon, in the provinces
of Albay, and Camarines Sur, two lines will
extend inland from Pasacao, which is to be
connected with Pagailao by a steamer service.

Active work in the construction of the Philippine railroads began in April, 1906, when fifty
American engineers sailed for the Philippines
on the steamship Minnesota. The party included field engineers, cashiers, clerks, and
stenographers-forming the nucleus of an
organization which has been supplemented as
progress advanced.

Eight thousand tons of steel for eighty miles
of track have been shipped, and locomotives
and cars are now in the islands. Survey work
is being carried on simultaneously on the different islands and it is the intention of the projectors to lay track as rapidly as possible, starting at the various seaports. Thus it will be
possible to develop a profitable business on
some sections of the road before the entire
system is completed, and it will also facilitate
the transportation of supplies and materials.

The preparations for carrying out the work
of survey and construction were made with the
utmost care, and provided for all possible
emergencies. Food and medical service and
sanitation receive careful attention in order to
minimize sickness and accidents.

The lines on the island of Luzon, Negros,
Cebu, and Panay will cost, in the aggregate,
about $ 30,000,000; but the project is considered
a paying one from the start.

The establishment by the United States
Government of a naval base at Olongapo, the
improvement of the harbors of the principal
seaports, the upbuilding of industries, both
old and new, and the completion of this system
of railroads will mark a new era in the history
of the Far East. During the next decade the
increased value of the Philippine Archipelago
to the United States will astonish those who
knew the islands ten years ago.
