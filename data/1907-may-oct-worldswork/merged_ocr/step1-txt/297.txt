THE UPLIFT OF THE WORLD

upon the millions of Springbok and tracked
the great lion to his lair. The train, from its
fittings, might be one of the Pennsylvania
flyers to Chicago; but it is merely the "train
de luxe" for Victoria Falls. It follows the
trail of the Lost Legion, the "long trek" of
the Father of the Boers. It cuts across the
battlefields of Cronje, De Wet, and Botha.
It taps Johannesburg, the heart of the Rand.
It threads the hills where Roberts swept the
broken forces of the Boers back on Pretoria.
Then on and on it picks its way, up through
the hills and plains, leaping at last on great
steel arches over the Zambesi, Livingstone's
river, then on into the unbroken jungle of the
great central plateau.

Here and there spurs pierce the ranges, or
reach down into valleys where white men
labor at the arts of peace, or black men work
the mines. They come from Durban up by
Ladysmith, creeping through the ranges to
tap the riches of the central land. And
with them come the hosts of civilization. Here
come the man of commerce, seeking his
wares; the German drummer, whose sole
ambition is to stamp his "made in Germany"
across the map of every country in the world;
the Pittsburg agent, anxious to show the
wonders of his mining machinery to the British
magnates of the Rand; agents for Canadian
whiskey, Scotch tweeds, English marmalade,
and all the other commodities that make things
hum on all the frontiers of the earth.

South Africa lies wide open. In each of its
colonies education and commerce grow side
by side, each in its separate way. At Bloemfontein, Pretoria, and other of the greater
centres, there are colleges that prepare the
students for university standing; and all over
the country there are schools, rural and town,
high and low, Dutch and English. They are
making an educated race in South Africa.
Good public libraries are springing up in even
the smaller villages. Life on the veldt has
lost its rigors. Last year they sent a football
team to Britain, and it won nearly all its games
against the best that Britain could oppose to
it. The country goes ahead with the leisurely
haste of the Englishman.

THE UPLIFT OF CENTRAL AFRICA

If one contemplate in amazement the progress of the South African regions, what shall
he say of the Congo, of Uganda, of Egypt?
Mr, Vemer, among others, has written of the

present-day tendencies in the Congo basin.
He has taken the traveler by rail and steamboat to the deep dark forests where the pygmies
dwell. Where Stanley blazed the way, the
cohorts of civilization have followed closely.
The very cannibals who hurled against the
canoes of the intrepid explorer clouds of
arrows are to-day themselves the pilots, the
firemen, the engineers of the river steamboats.
You may go on a winter excursion to the grave
of Uledi, suffering no hardship whatever on
the journey. Great regions of forest where
Stanley hewed his canoes are to be laid out
by companies incorporated under American or
Belgian laws, and developed at the hands of
American syndicates. The greedy hands of
industry reach far out into the very heart of
the Dark Continent, drawing down from the
eternal forests their wealth of rubber, timber,
and ivory.

On the opposite side of the continent, the
progress is even more startling. From Mombassa, half-way up the eastern coast of Africa,
the English built a railroad. They spent
nearly $ 25,000,000, merely to connect the
coast with the waters of the Victoria Nyanza.
It takes two days to travel by this little line
from the Indian Ocean to the great inland lake.
The result of it has been the rapid advancement
of civilization throughout British East Africa.
One hears very little of that region, but what
does come through the veil of official British
silence seems all very cheerful. Mr. A. C.
Coolidge, writing to The Nation recently,
described the steps in the progress of the
country in these words:

"A large savage population is being taught the principles
of law and order by a handful of honest, determined, and
devoted white officials. Life and property are generally
secure. Evenhanded justice is dealt out, roads are built,
production and trade are increasing."

secure.

A hopeful picture, surely. It is saddened,
yet brightened, by the story of the brave
Waganda, perhaps the noblest of the native
African tribes. They live at the upper end of
the railroad, on the highlands about the
lakes. In arts, in sciences, in civilization at
large, they have been esteemed the most advanced of all their brethren. They have been
called, at times, the "Japanese of Africa." But
they have bought their progress at great cost.
The race is dying, swiftly and certainly. The
terrible "sleeping sickness" has followed the
flag of Britain to the ridge of the African
