of a dozen new commonwealths be
yond the Mississippi; the next fifty
years will see the re-making of a dozen old
commonwealths below Mason and Dixon's
line. The energies of these people, for generations tragically pent-up or misdirected, are
now turned at last into their natural channels
of development. From 1900 to 1950 the
South will be the Land of Opportunity. As
our epic of the nineteenth century was the
Winning of the West, so our epic of the twentieth
will be the Development of the South.

In population, North Carolina was sixteenth
in rank among the states in 1890, fifteenth in
1900; twenty-third in rank as an agricultural
state in 1890, it was twentieth in 1900; rank,
ing thirty-first in manufacturing in 1890, in
1900 it stood twenty-eighth. For net gain
of rank in population, agriculture and manufactures it was equaled by no old state east or
west of the Mississippi, and only the newest
of the new states and territories of the WestOklahoma and Montana, drawing a sudden
stream of men and means from all other sections
-kept the same pace. The state made its
gain in population without foreign immigration, and the gain in agriculture and manufactures was made practically without foreign
capital. It was the energy of an awakened
and enfranchised people, coming at length
into its rightful heritage. With 17 per cent.
gain in population, the state made 78. per
cent. gain in agricultural output and 125 per
cent. gain in gross value of manufactured
products.

In the last five years the people of the state
have put more money into industrial establishments than they had accumulated in them for
the two hundred years preceding. Every time
the moon changes, they now add as much to
their property values as they had averaged per
year prior to 1900. Every two years they now

THE last fifty years have seen the making

put into their banks more money than all the
generations gone before had accumulated in
them up to the last census year. And they are
building a dozen schoolhouse for every factory,
and in the last decade they set up more printing
presses than banks.

There has been no noisy exploitation, no
sudden discovery of rich material resources,
no influx of aliens. In 1900 there were but
128 persons who could not speak English, and
no other state has made smaller drafts upon
the population of other American states.

The state began, its rebuilding in 1890 by
turning to the development of its people. The
agitation for longer and better schools took
definite shape in a widespread demand for
increasing the general tax rate for educational
purposes. The legislature elected in 1890
provided for the establishment of the Normal
and Industrial College for Young Women at
Greensboro. The same year the new Agricultural and Mechanical College at Raleigh
was beginning work with its first class.

These were but a few evidences of that broadening of democracy in which, I think, we have
the dominant note of upland Southern life
these last fifteen years. It has shown itself
not only in the determination to give a chance
to every boy and girl of every creed and color,
but it has also shown itself in political life.
Here no ruling aristocracy has prevented the
rise of the former non-slaveholding classes to
leadership. It was a "farmers' legislature"
in 1891 that began the educational revival
in North Carolina. So it was largely a revolt
against what the rural classes regarded as
machine rule that drove the Democratic Party
out of power in 1894; it came forward in 1898
with new leaders and amore modern spirit.

The most significant industrial fact brought
out by the census of 1890 is that the Piedmont

mountain ranges to the long line of sand hills
