8856 PRICK, THE SILENT

was settled out of court. By mutual agreement a new company was formed to settle, by
a redistribution of stock, the relative interests
of all the partners. This corporation was
named The Carnegie Company, and its stocks
and bonds, consisting of $ 160,000,000 of each,
were issued to Mr. Frick and the debtor partners, as well as to Mr. Carnegie, upon the basis
of their proportionate interest in the old company. This stroke made "the young geniuses"
millionaires overnight. It made Mr. Frick
one of the wealthiest men in the United States,
for his share was worth at par, roughly,
$ 15,484,000 in stocks and $ 15,800,000 in
bonds.

These events occurred in 1900. A few
months later Mr. Frick's pride received another
blow. The great scheme he had cherished of
a reorganized steel industry was put through,
but under Mr. Carnegie's direction and by one
of Mr. Carnegie's adherents. Mr. Charles M.
Schwab arranged another dinner with Mr.
Morgan and other New York bankers, and
his eloquence succeeded where Mr. Frick's
had failed. He painted a more glowing picture
than Mr. Frick's of the wonders of a consolidated steel industry. His eloquence won
the imagination of Mr. Morgan, and he undertook to finance the scheme. The result was
the United States Steel Corporation, organized
in 1901, with Charles M. Schwab as president,
to take over all the holdings of The Carnegie
Company and to include many independent
steel concerns of the country. The great
edifice of steel was finished, but it was what
Mr. Carnegie had intended it to be, a monument to himself.

The one consolation to Mr. Frick was that
his fortune was doubled by the deal. For his
$ 31,000,000 of stocks and bonds in The
Carnegie Company, he received, roughly,
United States Steel stocks worth at par
$ 45,500,000, and bonds worth $ 15,800,000,
or about $ 61,300,000 in all.

FOLLOWING MR. CARNEGIE'S TRAIL

But Mr. Frick was not done with Mr.
Carnegie. He would yet shatter the Carnegie
dream of an enduring monument in steel. He
established New York headquarters, which
to-day are in the name of Mr. S. L. Schoonmaker, with whom he was once associated in
the coke business in Pittsburg. In 1903, when
the general decline in stocks carried down the
value of the United States Steel Corporation's

securities, Mr. Frick bought heavily into them.
He emerged from what seemed to Wall Street
to be a speculative campaign with enough
United States Steel stocks in his control to
make him a first-class power in its direction.

His next move was to compass the downfall
of Charles M. Schwab, who as president personified the Carnegie preeminence. In this
he succeeded, though he could not prevent
the election of another Carnegie man, W. E.
Corey, to the presidency. But he has succeeded
in making Wall Street and steel men realize
that, though Mr. Corey is in name the head of
the corporation and directs its routine details,
Mr. Frick is the genius whose will shapes the
policies and commands the destinies of the
steel industry of the country. And he has
succeeded further in creating the belief that it
will not be long before his power will be sufficient to bring him to the front publicly as the
successor to the title of the Steel King. When
he has finally wrested this title from Mr.
Carnegie, one of Mr. Frick's deepest wounds
will be healed. He will have wiped out what
he believes to be the humiliation that Mr.
Carnegie inflicted upon him.

Mr. Frick has followed the Carnegie trail
in another curious fashion. The first modern
office building in Pittsburg was erected by Mr.
Carnegie about 1900. He named it the Carnegie Building. It occupies an imposing site
on Fifth Avenue, near the crest of the hill
crowned by the Allegheny County Courthouse.
The Frick Building, completed in 1904, towers
above the Carnegie Building on the next lots
up the hill, and shuts off the light from one side
of the Carnegie Building. The Frick Building is of noticeably finer finish; it has only
Carrara marble and mahogany within. Its
main entrance leads directly to a great stained
glass window representing "Progress," by Mr.
John La Farge, the modern master of the art.

Then came the Frick Building Annex. It
cuts off the light from another side of the Carnegie Building. And the lots across Fifth
Avenue from the Carnegie Building, formerly
the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral, are now
owned by Mr. Frick.

Mr. Carnegie desires to leave behind him in
Pittsburg another great monument to his
name. In Schenley Park he bought a large
tract of land upon which he erected the Carnegie
Library and the Carnegie Technical Schools.
These magnificent buildings cost many millions and are endowed with many more
