THE RAILROAD CONQUEST OF THE
MOUNTAINS

HOW THE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER DOES HIS WORLD-CHANGING WORK

HEN a writer seeks picturesqueness

(' iii) in a railroad story he turns naturally

to the engineers. When he has
gone the rounds, interviewed every chief,
engineer and every railroad president in town,
he comes at last to Number I Broadway,
and finds General Grenville M. Dodge. He
cannot miss that trail, for every engineer and
every president will begin his conversation
with the remark:

"General Lodge is the man you ought to
see!"

He sits at a big oak desk in a high office on
the south side of the building beside a window
that affords him a sweeping view of the two
rivers and the harbor, away down beyond the
Narrows. Without a view like that, New
York would cramp him, for he spent the better
part of his life in the plains and the mountains
of the West.

He is an old man now-seventy-six by the
calendar-but he neither looks it nor acts it.
He is still chairman of the board for a company
or two, and his associates vouch for it that he
is no "dummy director." His face is weatherbeaten and gray, but his eyes are still the eyes
of the Major-General who won his stars with
Sherman and with Grant, and who led the
forces of the Union in more than one of the
Indian campaigns.

The place is redolent of history. Faded
prints and portraits hang upon the walls,
authographed portraits of Grant, Sherman,
Lincoln, and many others of the mighty men of
the last generation.

"Yes, I met Lincoln, along before the War,"
he says, "and he was a wonderful man. It was
in Council Bluffs, in 1859, I think. I had been
out on the plains looking for a line to the Coast.
I was sitting on the steps of the hotel when
along came Mr. Lincoln and sat down beside
me. I had stored up a lot of information to

give to my employers, but Mr. Lincoln got it
all. He had that way about him."

When General Lodge grows reminiscent,
the ghosts of the past come to life. Of Sherman, in particular, he speaks with familiarity
and always in terms of the warmest friendship
and admiration. He can tell wild tales of the
eight years from 1852 to 1860, the years he
spent out in the great wilderness beyond
Omaha, making the first surveys that were to
establish the route for the Union Pacific,
traversing the "barren" plains, planting the
first stakes of civilization's survey in a land of
savage promise. And then, in later years, there
came the building of Jay Gould's Texas &
Pacific, piercing the plains of western Texas.
It is the Epic of the Plains, told in terse prose.

The purpose of this article is to give to the
uninitiated some faint idea of the methods that
are followed in the building of the great railroads through the mountain regions. General
Dodge's expeditions in search of a route for the
Union Pacific illustrate very aptly the methods
and purposes of what is technically called a
"reconnaissance." For that reason it will be
referred to in this article quite frequently.

THE FIRST STEP IN RAILROAD BUILDING

Roughly, a new railroad may be said to begin
with this reconnaissance. It is simply a trip over
the ground made by a man or men with, as
they say, "an eye for the country." This
means that the head of the party must be
qualified by nature and experience to take in
all the essential details of the country, its
physical capability to support a railroad, its
natural obstacles, the nature of its rock formations, its soil, and all other broad characteristics. His report is not greatly detailed. He
will, perhaps, recommend that the surveys
take the south side of a certain ridge because
of the freedom from snow-slides; or the north
