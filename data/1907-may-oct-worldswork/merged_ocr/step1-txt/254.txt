CAMPAIGN FUNDS AS AN EDUCATIONAL
INFLUENCE

IN ONE of his interesting recent addresses at Yale University, Secretary Root
spoke of the educational value of political
campaigns and in defense of campaign funds.
Among other interesting things, he said this:

"Doubtless there may have been abuses in raising and
applying campaign funds, but in the main there is no more
useful expenditure of money from the public point of view
than this, which in the last Presidential election, according
to official statements, amounted to only about three and
one-half cents per capita for the people of the United States
on one side and probably somewhat less on the other, for
the great bulk of it is applied to the political education bf
voters."

True enough, if only campaign funds be
willingly paid and be paid only for patriotic
motives and be spent in legitimate ways. The
main matter is not the amount of a fund but
what it is paid for, both when it is paid in and
when it is paid out.

We have grown somewhat more sensitive
about motives and purposes; and it is hoped that
this public sensitiveness will continue till Con,
gress makes it imperative on the collectors and
spenders of these funds that they shall publish
a truthful accounting. Then there can be
little, if any, objection to them or to the size of
them. In fact, publicity will prevent them
from becoming very large. And, whether
large or small, their educational value will be
as great as Secretary Root declares, just as
their demoralizing influence under the old
practice of bargains and secrecy is out of proportion to their size.

ABOUT SECRETARY TAFT

SYMPATHETIC sketch and study of
Secretary Taft's career is begun in
this number of THE WORLD'S WORK not only
(nor mainly) because he seems the most
probable candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency, but especially because
it is a practically unbroken career in the public
service; and it is a career that is as good an
example as contemporary life affords in any
land of high devotion to public duty.
He has shown a genius for public affairs,
and he has had a succession of experiences
that make him, perhaps, better equipped for

the Presidency than any other man has been in
our later history. A well-trained lawyer, a notable solicitor for the Government, a judge, the
practical molder of our colonial government'
in the Philippines-a piece of work comparable
to Lord Cromer's in Egypt-and Secretary
of War during this period of canal-building
and of our tutelage of Cuba-this is an experience to ripen a man's judgment, if there
ever was such an experience. Luck has been
with him; for luck generally shows a preference for such a combination of character and
temperament. Mr Lyle's story of Secretary
Taft's life is as good matter for the building up
of a sound view of public service in our democracy as this magazine knows how to present.
It is a record of high service, not of private
gain, at every step.

And, as far as present indications are trustworthy (in the shifting scenes of national
politics where all indications may be fallacious),
Secretary Taft seems much more likely than
any other man to be the Republican nominee.
The farce of Senator Foraker's opposition to
him in Ohio was too shallow and too short
even to afford good political sport; and no
other man within the range of the convention's
probabilities presents such positive qualities
of confidence and popularity. The Secretary,
with character and experience of the highest
kind and with a winning personality, stands
for definite policies which the people understand and have approved both at a Presidential
and a Congressional election-the broad policies of the present Administration.

Again, if present signs mean anything, the
Democrats will nominate Mr. Bryan; and
Secretary Taft will win with Mr. Bryan as
his opponent. That is as certain as any
political prediction can be.

THE NEW YORK PUBLIC UTILITIES LAW

MOST extraordinary and most hopeful
thing has come to pass in the state of
New York. Public opinion led by one resolute
man has expressed itself in radical legislative
action against the determined and combined
efforts of the political managers of both parties
and of the great interests that hold the public
franchises in the state. Governor Hughes's
Utilities Bill became a law in spite of these
difficulties and over the veto of the mayor of
New York City. As a demonstration of the
power of public opinion, well led, over the
strongest combination of opposing interests
