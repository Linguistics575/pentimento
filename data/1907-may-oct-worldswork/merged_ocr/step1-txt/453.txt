THE DANGER SPOT OF EUROPE

the attitude of the Servian government to the
Macedonian question is an attitude that calls
for a period of complete tolerance. The
Servians believe that the injustice and barbarity of the Turkish rule must be stopped,
and that the mixed Greek, Bulgarian, Serb,
and Moslem population of that unhappy
country must be given ten years or so of tolerance, and liberty to work out their own salvation. They still look to England to take a
leading part in the establishment of such a
regime in Macedonia.

There remains one Balkan State whose
position in the matter of Macedonia and the
Powers I have not touched. That is Northern
Albania, the wildest of all the Balkan states.
Albania is held by the Turks. I spent some
time in Skodra, or Scutari, and studied very
carefully the conditions that exist. Skodra
is not a town of progress, for there the telephone and the electric light are forbidden;
machinery of every kind is against the law, and
neither newspapers nor books are allowed to
enter the state. Therefore, in these crooked
streets the traveler is back in mediaeval days.

The lean, ragged, ill-fed soldiers of the
Sultan occupy the city, but the wild tribesmen
come down into the place in small detachments,
a dozen or so together, in complete defiance
of the Turk. With men upon whose heads a
price has been set, known brigands and murderers, indeed, I have chatted md drunk
coffee in the bazaar-all wild fellows who
know no law except their own and who
do not acknowledge the Sultan as their ruler.

A little later, I was the guest of Vatt Marashi,
the brigand Chieftain of the Skreli, in the wild
mountains, and he talked freely and confidently
upon the future of Albania.

"We, with the Kastrati, the Hoti, the Klementi, the Pulati, and the Shiala are masters
here. We have held the land always, and shall
hold it still.
our own, and pay no taxes to anybody. The
Turks know full well that when we unite with
our brothers, the Miriditi in the South, then
Skodra will be at our mercy. If they came
here, we would pick them off as fast as they
came. There are 40,000 of us Skreli alone,

without the other tribes. If a Turkish army
, came in here, it would never get out again."

"And is there likely to be a rising against
the Turks?" I asked.

"Why, of course.

can afford to wait. Turkey will soon have its
hands full with Bulgaria and with Macedonia,
and then-well, we shall help Bulgaria, and in
a week there won't be a Turk in Skodra."

"You mean there will be a massacre?"

For answer he shrugged his shoulders.

"And after the revolution N'

"We hope to obtain our independence under
France or some other far-off country-England,
for instance. Austria and Italy, through their
priests, are carrying on a strenuous propaganda
among us, but we will not lift a finger for either
Italy or Austria. More than one of their agents
has of late-disappeared .l "

Thus, I have canvassed the sentiment of
the whole Peninsula with regard to the fate of
Macedonia, the Land of Black Terror. I find
Bulgaria determined to strike for the lives and
liberties of its people in that luckless country.
Roumania and Servia are bound to inactivity
by their own political exigencies, but both will
actively support Bulgaria when the die is cast.
Montenegro is heart and soul with any movement for the expulsion of the Turk. The
wild Albanian tribes are merely waiting for
the signal to pour down from their mountain
fastnesses upon the outlying posts of the
Turkish Empire. Within a brief space, the
flames of war will blaze from one end of the
Balkans to the other.

And Turkey rests, supine and confident. In
Constantinople, I talked with Noury Bey,
Secretary-General of the Imperial Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.

"The question of Macedonia," he said, "is,
I admit, an extremely difficult one. We have
to govern a population so varied, both in nationality and creed, that there must, of necessity, be constant aggressions and outbreaks.
It is said that we aid and abet the Greek
bands in massacring the Christians. I totally
deny this. Surely it is to our own interest to
maintain peace and order in Macedonia!"

"And the protests of Bulgaria?"

His Excellency smiled.

"We hear from time to time threats of war,"
was his response. "But when we hear them
we remember that we are 16,000,000 Turks;
and when we sleep, we sleep quite undisturbed
by any war rumors from Sofia."

Later, I had other interviews at the Yildiz
with the Sultan himself, and with members of
the Government; all asserted that Turk:' is
not in any way afraid of Bulgaria. The lot
is, Turkey is uncertain of the attitude of Sonic.
