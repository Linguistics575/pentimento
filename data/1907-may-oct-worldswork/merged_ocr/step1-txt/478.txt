terminable after a fixed period, and meanwhile subject to
purchase at a fair value.

"Municipalities should have the power to enter the field
of municipal ownership upon popular vote under reasonable
regulation.

"Private companies operating public utilities should be
subject to public regulation and examination under a
system of uniform records and accounts and of full
publicity."

The general attitude of the committee to the
whole large subject of the nature of public
utilities is worthy of note. These it believes
to be monopolistic and not subject to the
regulative force of competition. It thus follows
that they should be either regulated or operated
by the public, if the public is to secure fair
treatment. The report as a whole is encouraging to those who believe in moderate municipal
ownership and effective public control. It
utterly discourages the leaving of these corporations to regulate themselves and, on the
other hand, it refuses to regard municipal
ownership as a panacea. It is probable that
this is as fair a statement of our experience and
of the conclusions of thoughtful men as could
be made. It means that we have definitely
abandoned the old idea of leaving public utilities
to corporations without regulation and that we
are ready to adopt even municipal ownership
wherever local conditions permit a reasonable
hope of success.

CITY REFORMATION THROUGH CALAMITIES

HE more experiments we make in trying to
get rid of corrvpt municipal politics, the
clearer it becomes that concentrated personal
responsibility in government is one of the conditions of success. Whenever a city finds itself
overwhelmed by some disaster or by simply
insufferable corruption, it turns instinctively
to this method.

The "Texas idea" had its beginning after
the great flood at Galveston. The city government broke down under this calamity and the
public affairs were thrust into the hands of a
committee of public-spirited men in whom the
community had confidence. They restored
order; they set the community going again in a
satisfactory fashion; and the people then asked
themselves why this highly successful form of
improvised city government should not be made
permanent. The charter was changed; a
mayor-president and four commissioners were
elected-every man personally responsible for
his department. Other cities of Texas for.

lowed. The notable success of the plan'in
Houston, which substituted a remarkably good
government for a very bad one, gave a great
impetus to it; and the principle has now been
applied in several parts of the United States.
San Francisco had a double calamity; for
its government at the time of the disaster and
afterwards was perhaps the most corrunt and
shameless in all American experience. By the
energy of Mr. Heney, as prosecutor, and of
Mr. Rudolph Spreckels, as a public-spirited
man of wealth, Mayor Schmitz was sent to the
penitentiary for five years; and a mayor was
chosen by the supervisors, practically at the
dictation of those who had brought Schmitz to
trial. They chose Dr. E. R. Taylor, a most
versatile and highly esteemed man who has had
experience in almost every kind of work but
politics. He was dean of a law school, acting
president of a medical college (being both a
lawyer and a physician), and a poet to boot.
He takes the full personal responsibility for the
government of the city at this critical time, when
public crime has followed the great physical
calamity and when confidence and honesty
count for more even than usual. There are
perhaps 100 million dollars' worth of buildings
now going up there, and more than ever before
the community needs rest from thieves and
bosses. At such a time, it turns to the plan of
concentrating the responsibility for its government on one man, and he not a political creature.
Again, in Louisville, Ky., a similar thing has
been done. The era of Goebel politics in
Kentucky brought something closely akin to
civil war in Louisville municipal elections.
The city ceased to be a "stronghold" of Democracy and a vigorous opposition grew up to
the brutal machine methods.
unscrupulous did the machine become at the
last election that its candidates took the offices
by fraud. When the contest was carried into
the courts, the election was declared void, the
incumbents were removed, and it fell to the
Governor to appoint new city officers pending
an election. Governor Beckham appointed as
Mayor Mr. Robert W. Bingham, a young
lawyer of courage and character and standing,
who has the full personal responsibility for the
city's government. The subordinate officials
of the machine have been removed and Mayor
Bingham is practically in the same relation to
the government and to the city as Mayor Taylor
of San Francisco, and each of them has the
same concentrated personal responsibility as
