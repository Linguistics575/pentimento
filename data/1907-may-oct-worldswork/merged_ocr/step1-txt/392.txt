9190 MEXICO AT HIGH-TIDE



The company represents an American investment of about $ 6,000,000.





The ore usually in the bins awaiting treatment is worth $ 1,000,000

but the mountains were cleared of timber until
the circle grew too big, and as the shafts, fitted
with "chicken ladders," could not be followed
any deeper, the treasure still there had to be
abandoned. Then an American harnessed up a
waterfall and brought a wire into camp. The
ore can be lifted by modern hoists, and then
treated cheaply because of cheap power. And
now they say in that camp that the old Spaniards only scratched the vein. The millions
of ounces taken out were but a crumb. Costly
development work, including a tunnel to open
up the ore body, may or may not justify such
a hope. But meantime Guanajuato enjoys
life again. Nearly 600 stamp mills are in
operation, and the cheap ores the Spaniards
could not touch, and their tailings and dumps
out of which they could not get the gold, are
yielding handsomely. One entire village of



300 adobe houses, Tepetapa by name, has been
bought for pay dirt on the basis of actual
assays. The adobe bricks had been made
from the slimes formed by grinding ore, and
the gold in them runs as high as $ 12 to the ton.

However, all volcanic Mexico seems like a
thriving mining camp. Mexico gave our
continent its very first mining boom, and to-day
after four centuries it is part of the boom that
spreads even to the Arctic regions. "It is
believed," says The Engineering and Mining
J carnal, "that the development of the mineral
resources of the republic has been only begun."
It is estimated that during 1905-06 $ 50,000,000
of American capital went into Mexican mines.
At Cananea, an American copper enterprise
has invested $ 15,000,000, employs 5,000 men,
and supports a town of 25,000. In Sonora
another American company has expended
