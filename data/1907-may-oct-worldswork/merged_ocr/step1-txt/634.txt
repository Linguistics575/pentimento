germ fulfil the measure of its destiny only
through the aid both of man and one of
300 varieties of mosquitoes? The answer
to these questions lies mainly in the fighting
power of the blood. The proportion of red
blood-cells in the human body is about 830 to I
white, but there is a tremendous variation in
their numbers at various times. The red cells
grow by the millions during a balloon ascension
or a fortnight's residence in high altitudes; and
they are destroyed "in six ciphers" by fever or
a wound-sooo/soo are lost in every 30 drops
of blood. The white cells increase rapidly
after a hearty meal, only to decrease again
before the dinner gong sounds once more.

One of the lowest forms of life is the amoeba
--a bit of jelly-like protoplasm which moves
like a cumulus cloud on a summer's day, drawing in here and extending there. All these
changes in the shaped the amoeba represent its
search for food. It has no mouth; when a
germ comes floating by, the amoeba either
hollows itself like a thimble or runs out arm-like
extensions and enfolds the germ.

Our white blood-corpuscles are essentially
amrcbar-bits of protoplasm able to reach out
and envelope germs, oil drops, gas bubbles,
and broken-off bits of blood-clot.

lNow every unconscious action in living
creatures is the result of a stimulus, and that
excitant is the product of a ferment. The
individual parts of the amaeba's protoplasm
do not initiate any contraction or extension,
but they respond to the stimulus of acid or
alkali, heat or cold, to chemical attraction or
repulsion. Our blood contains a great variety
of these excitants, varying in individuals and
in the same individual from time to time. It
also contains a great variety of foods, on some
of which one germ can thrive while another
starves. Hence the peculiar differences of
individuals and species in immunities.

There is not a germ that enters our blood
which the blood-cells are unable to kill, but
their fighting power depends upon the quality
of the blood-as a food, as an agglutinizer, as
a poisoner, as a digester. The body's defence
depends also upon the -relative number of
germs and white blood-cells.

OPSONrNS-A NEW HOPE FOR HEALTH

promising attacks have been made on typhoid,
acute epidemic dysentery, and bubonic plague.
Next to these come cholera, anthrax, and scarlet
fever. Thus far, the most obstinate diseases
have been three of the most destructive
of all: tuberculosis, pneumonia, and infected
wounds. Hope for the conquering of these is
now offered by opsonins.

And the public should remember that it is
thus far only a hope. It is wise to recall the
premature exploitation of Koch's tuberculin
caught up as a message of hope by sufferers
under the unappealable sentence of tuberculosis. This hope, unjustified by the results,
was followed by a deeper despair, and the
slow-moving advance of medical science was
still further retarded.

It is claimed for opsonins that they act upon
the invading germs in such a way as to increase
the willingness and ability of the white blood,
corpuscles to engulf and digest them. While
opsonins exist in all human blood, they are at
times insufficient to prevent infection or to
overcome it. By submitting colonies of particular germs to partial sterilization-which
destroys the lives of the germs but not the
chemical efficiency of their excretions--and
injecting the product in proper amount to one
suffering from the disease which the same kind
of germs has caused, the patient's blood is
said then to be able to destroy the invaders.
This sounds easy but the process is far from
simple.

THE DOSE OF OPSONINS

If opsonin were to be given as old-fashioned
hospitality set bread and wine before guests, the
injections would be apt to kill. Each patient's
dose must be determined by a test of the opsonic
standard of his blood. (How this, will annoy
the quacksl) We ordinarily guage the amount
of a drug to be given by knowing how, much
is ordinarily required to secure that drug's
intended effect and by the severity of attack.
But, in giving opsonins, it is necessary to measure the dose by a mathematical count of the
digestive capacity of the sick man's white
blood-cells-not at the normal but with the
particular germs now in his blood. If he has
tuberculosis, the physician must calculate how
many tubercle germs each white blood-cell
can digest. And, at the same time, this eating
ability must be tested in the blood of a well man,
to get a guage of normal digestive power. By
