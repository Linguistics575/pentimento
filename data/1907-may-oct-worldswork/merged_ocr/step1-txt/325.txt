families now the children are sent regularly
to the dentist-not so much to have cavities
filled, as to prevent them. Some people also
submit periodically to an examination of the
eyes, in order that any damage may be detected early and may be corrected before it has
gone far. And there are some men who have
the good sense to retain a physician upon
exactly the basis upon which the lawyer is
kept: not primarily to help them out of trouble,
but to keep them from needing to be helped
out. It will be his duty, of course, to undertake his client's case if, by infringing some of
Nature's laws, he has made himself liable for
damages; but the physician's main responsibility will be preventive-he will give his
client expert assistance in keeping out of
trouble. He will give him warning when he
is running under too little headway; he will
prime him for an emergency; he will tell him
when he is making a risky deal.

He must be even more of a specialist in the
laws of health than in those of disease; for his
business is to show his client how to run his
complex, highly organized, physical corporation so as to get the biggest results-maximum
efficiency-with the least danger. Entanglements with disease are costly.

The physician and surgeon are of much use
in sickness; but they are of far more use when
they succeed in preventing sickness. Prevention is worth more than cure. Its cash value
is greater. It is good economy: it saves time,
money, energy, opportunity.

Unless he has some decisive warning, unless
there is some creak worse than usual in his
physical machinery, the average man does not
see a doctor professionally from decade to
decade. What does he lose? What does the
engine lose if no one but the coal stoker looks
it over for a month, or a year? Perhaps the
engine will run without mishap 364 days, and
on the 365th day the boiler will burst. For
364 days the owner of the engine did not lose
anything by his, neglect to employ the skilled
engineer. On the 365th day he lost enough
to make the wages of the skilled engineer a
mere bagatelle in comparison. N or is it wholly
true to say that the owner of the engine lost
nothing in the 364 days. Under the management of the skilled engineer, the engine would
probably have developed a fraction of a horsepower more every day; the total difference
during the year might have been appreciable.

The analogy is obvious. The man who

goes along twenty years without expert supervision over his physical machine may do very
well for twenty years; but it would have been
better to consult a physician every month for
twenty years and in the twenty-first be saved
from going to "smash," than it would be to go
without his advice for twenty years and go to
pieces in the twenty-first. To consult a physician regularly is life insurance of a far more
vital type than the financial kind.

The lawyer that is valuable to a corporation
is the lawyer that has been with it for years and
knows its most intricate characteristics. Corporations differ no more than human beings
differ. Jones & Company could not call in
even Daniel Webster and expect him to give
them the best advice on a knotty problem after
twenty minutes' consultation. The man who
expects to get expert counsel with reference to
health and the conduct of life by spending
twenty minutes in the office of a doctor who
has never seen him before, is no more reasonable. It is more true of the individual than
of the corporation that many essential elements
can be discovered only through long acquaintance, no matter how skilful the physician.

It is just as necessary to go to a physician who
has specialized in this department of constructive medicine, as it is to go to an oculist when
one wishes most expert work done for the eyes.
As yet, relatively few physicians are specialists
upon hygiene, and the reason is not far
to seek: the public does not demand such
specialists. It prefers to take pills on "snap"
diagnoses, or to submit to occasional surgical
operations when the case has gone far. As a
result of this lack of public demand, the financial compensations for this branch of medicine
are small.

In order to be acquainted with the whole
range of preventive medicine, a man has fully
as large a scientific territory to explore and
keep in touch with as has any other specialist.
My own impression is that he has a larger field
than any other specialist. In a measure, his
field must include a general survey of all
others. He must be an expert diagnostician.
To discover the trouble is a far more difficult
thing to do than to select the measures that
shall make for cure.

The large fee and the large place in the community are to-day given to the man who can
perform a surgical operation with skill. And
yet, it is of more importance to get that advice which shall make the surgical operation
