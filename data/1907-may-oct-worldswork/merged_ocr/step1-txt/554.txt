9352 TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

The defendants were found guilty and fined.
They appealed, but the Supreme Court paid
Judge Taft the rare compliment of handing
down his decision in full, virtually as its own
decision. It is now the precedent in all the
courts of the land.

But he criticizes the law itself. "The
Sherman Anti-Trust Act," he says, "is one
which might have been made much more
definite, in justice to the business community,
in justice to the executive and to the courts
required to enforce it, and a large part of the
difficulty which has been experienced in attempted execution of that Act is due, not at
all to the lack of energy and courage on the part
of the executive or courts in enforcing it, but to
the indefiniteness of the Act and the necessity
for mending it or rendering it specific by judicial
decision in such a way that it may become of
practical use. The first section, against conspiracies in restraint of trade, is perhaps not
so difficult to construe; but when it comes to
the definition of what an unlawful monopoly
is in interstate trade, it is no wonder that even
at this late date there has been no satisfactory
judicial decision which can be used as a guide
by those charged with the immediate execution
of the law."

His anti-trust decision, however, was not the
only instance when Judge Taft made a preeedent. He established also the law of patent
rights. Here was not only an entirely different
field, but a class of litigation full of technicalities. It requires lawyers expert in that one
study, and yet Judge Taft made himself an
expert in it too. All over the country the patent
lawyers manoeuvred to get their cases before
him if they possibly could. They were sure
then of an intelligent hearing.

HOW JUDGE TAFT WROTE DECISIONS

To appreciate the thoroughness and industry
with which Judge Taft worked, you should
know how he wrote his decisions. First, he
studied the case thoroughly, until he was an
authority on the particular law involved, its
origin, growth, and application. Then, without a note before him, he began dictating to his
secretary, and frequently kept at it until late
into the night. After stating the facts, he
would comment on the case by its logical
divisions. Completing a division, he cited
references and precedents. He would tell his
secretary to copy from a certain volume of
reports, at a certain page and paragraph.

This was the only time he made use of notes.
But he had well in mind the substance of such
quoted passages, and constantly referred to
them during dictation without a note before
him. When all the divisions of the case had
been disposed of in their order, he would then
formulate his opinion, and this was a clear--a delightfully clear-deduction from what had
gone before.

His thinking was so clear, indeed, and his
grasp on the train of ideas so firm, that he
could be interrupted in the middle of a sentence,
talk, laugh, or joke, and afterward go on as
evenly as though there had been no interruption. Or if the secretary himself stopped him,
being uncertain of a passage, the Judge would
go back and dictate again, word for word,
what he had dictated before.

Judge Taft was mightily hard pressed if he
closeted himself against interruptions. Usually
he worked with his door open, though other
judges wondered at him, and anyone might
break in on him and be received cheerily, as
though the Judge had nothing else in the world
to do but to tell jolly stories. He was
particularly kind to students in the Law School,
and he could always find time to help with any
hard legal knots they brought to him.

But dictation was only the initial stage.
Judge Taft practically wrote his decisions
over again and again. The decision of the
anti-trust case he must have rewritten ten
times. In this he was like Justice Harlan, who
nearly breaks the Government with printer's
corrections, and just the opposite of Justice
Day, who dictated once, and if the printer
followed copy, the decision was ready to be
handed down. But with Judge Taft's first
proofs began the painstaking labor of making
the words fit the thought, and he would strike
out or insert a paragraph, change and interline,
and ask for corrected proofs. Then the same
process would begin again; and so on, until
the words were as glass, through which one
beheld the figure of Justice, not blindfolded,
but clear-eyed, with her scales accurately
poised.

Even on his vacations-for a vacation was
only a change of venue for business-Judge
Taft would send for his cases, write out his
opinions, and send them back to be printed.
Thus his work went on just the same. He always
kept the court's docket close up to date, and
he seemed always ready to take on more work,
and to do that work cheerfully. It is told of
