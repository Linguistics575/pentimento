9200 A NEGRO'S
to stay at Hampton for only a few years and
then go into some pioneer work among my
people. A few weeks later, General Armstrong
asked me if I would assume the responsibility
of the discipline and the military instruction of
the institution, as Mr. Freeland had been
appointed a chaplain in the United States army.

I remained at Hampton that summer. In
the fall, I had my first experience in organizing
the battalion and assigning work and rooms
to the boys. It was not so difficult as I had
supposed, largely because I had the good will
and cooperation of the young men of both
races.

In November, General Armstrong, while in
the North pleading the cause of the Negro and
the Indian, was stricken with paralysis, from
which he never recovered. During his long
illness, I learned to know him better than ever.
I had traveled with him in the North and many
things about him had struck me as very unusual. I could never understand why a man
so great and so busy as he could be so solicitous,
under all circumstances, for the comfort of the
Quartet and the other boys who were with
him. If we had uncomfortable quarters, he
would share them. If we were put at a seemingly undesirable table in a hotel, he would
sit with us. If we found it necessary to take
a hack at a station or to hire a wagon for our
baggage, he always got the man who had the
poorest horse and the most disreputable looking vehicle. He remarked one day that such
a man needed the money most and therefore
we must help him. A few days before his
death, he asked to see me, but this was against
the doctor's orders. He insisted, however,
and Mrs. Armstrong finally yielded. He said
that he had noticed that the students were
much quieter during the last few days. He had
not heard the laughter of the boys going past
his house to and from their meals, and he
wanted to know if any order had been given
for them to be quiet on his account. I told
him that this was the case. He asked that I
should immediately countermand the order
and say that their noise pleased him. He did
not wish his illness to have in any sense a
depressing effect upon teachers or students,
and he suggested that I see Mr. Frissell and
that we arrange as soon as possible a concert
or humorous reading. He wanted to counteract the depressing effect that his illness had on
the school. I could not then understand how
a man so ill should be thinking about such

minor details as the life of the students and the
school. During this interview, he questioned
me about the minutest detail of the school
work, even about individual pupils.

General Armstrong's death, in May, 1903,
was to all of the students and friends of Hampton a tremendous blow. We could not see how
the school could possibly exist without him. He
had actually worn himself out going throughout
the North, begging the money necessary for
the maintenance of the work which he had
founded at so great a sacrifice of time and
strength and energy. His personality was so
overwhelming that it seemed to me that no one
could possibly take his place. We all loved
Mr. Frissell and had the greatest respect for
him, but we doubted seriously whether he
could take General Armstrong's place, and, as
I think of it to-day, we were right. General
Armstrong had completed his work and Mr.
Frissell, who succeeded him, is doing as perfect and as complete a work as did General
Armstrong; but he is filling his own place and,
I am sure, in a way that would merit General
Armstrong's approval.

I felt, after graduating, as did many of my
fellow resident graduates, that our education
was not by any means completed, so for some
years we did graduate work in advanced subjects under some of the teachers of Hampton
Institute. Out of this effort for advanced
training has grown the present graduate courses
in the institution. I continued my law studies
also for some time under the tutelage of Mr.
F. S. Collier, a lawyer in the town of Hampton,
a Southern gentleman, who not only instructed
me without pay but allowed me the use of his
library.

The work of a disciplinarian one would naturally expect to be irksome; to ferret out irregularities, to punish misdemeanors, and settle
disputes, would naturally not make a man
popular with those over whom he exercises
such authority. And then, too, I had the added
difficulty of being a Negro and having to
deal with the Indians as well as the members
of my own race. Many of my friends advised
me against accepting the work, feeling that
while I might succeed with my own race I
could not get along with the Indians, and that
when questions arose between the two races it
would be impossible for me to give a decision
that would satisfy both. I confess that I also
had serious misgivings; but I felt that if one
were honest and sympathetic in his dealings,
