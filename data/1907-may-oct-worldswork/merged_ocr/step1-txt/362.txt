9160 THE MARCH
leaders-stood in dead earnest for opposing
policies. if you were a Republican, you were
a protectionist; and, if you were a Democrat,
(in spite of Mr. Randall and Mr. German
and a few other such men) you were a radical
tariff-reformcr, perhaps even a free-trader.
Mr. Cleveland's second election was the
triumph of this latter party principle. It meant
this emphatically and it had no other meaning.

Then came the economic breakdown of the
Democratic Party. It vilified Mr. Cleveland;
it took up the free coinage of silver; it accepted
the leadership of Mr. Bryan. In a word, it
lost economic character and standing among
the thoughtful political parties of the world. It
became a "crank" party. The sound business
and financial interests of the whole country
were necessarily arrayed against it. This
was enough to defeat it.

But the damage done by a breakdown in
economic character by one party was, of course,
not confined to that one party. It is almost
always true that when one party breaks down
in character, the other does too. The massing
of all the strong industrial, commercial, and
financial interests in the opposing party brought
the inevitable result of strong financial management into politics-in a word, brought Mr.
Hanna and his unprecedented use of money in
campaigns; and along with this came the still
greater power in politics and in government
of the great financial interests. Had they
not saved the country and was the government
not properly theirs? M r. Hanna himself went
into the Senate and leadership in Congress
passed more and more completely into the
hands of representatives of the great financial
and transportation interests.

President McKinley saw clearly the wrong
and the danger of this excessive special privilege
and therefore of special power; and, when his
death occurred, he was gradually preparing
the way for an effort to correct the most
glaring inequalities of the tariff-in other
words, to give his party again a party policy.

Mr. Roosevelt has gone toward the same
large purpose of freeing the government from
undue control by the great interests, but he
has gone about it in a different way. Any
change in the tariff must be legislative. But
Mr. Roosevelt in his characteristic effort to
enforce the laws found pressing executive tasks
which led to the lessening of the grasp of great
corporations on undue profit and power; and
he has proceeded toward the same large pur

pose by making the executive department
energetic-by enforcing laws that had been
already enacted and by insisting on fortifying
them by supplementary legislation. This has
been a swifter and a more direct attack on
privilege than trying to reform the tariff, and
a method more in keeping with Mr. Roosevelt's
temperament. And he has given his party a
policy-the restraint of corporations from
injustice and from undue political power.

All this activity has strengthened the party
at least so long as it shall have earnest instead
of merely machine leadership. And the question now is whether it will hold to this policy,
as a party.

But in the meantime, unfortunately for both
parties, y the Democrats have not developed
a leader since Mr. Cleveland who can command the confidence of the commercial and
financial world; and they have no united
earnestness about any policy. In spite of the
apparently growing objection to Mr. Bryan,
shown by the Democratic press, there is yet
visible no other Democrat of national reputation whom the party seems likely to nominate.
T here would be no use in putting forward
another unknown man such as Judge Parker
was. While the party has, of course, recovered
from its old lapse into the fatal error of advo,
eating free silver coinage, it has not yet come
back to the positive and courageous position
that it took under Mr. Cleveland's leadership.

Thus it has come about that the parties, as
parties, are of little account. The Republican
Party, which lost its character by complete
surrender to the Great Interests under the
Hanna management, has been saved by Mr.
Roosevelt's activity and by Democratic ineffieieney; but what positive qualities of character
it will have, after Mr. Roosevelt retires from
the White House, will depend wholly upon its
future leadership. If the same kind of men
get control of it again as had control when Mr.
Roosevelt became President, it will provoke
a great contest of classes. It will breed Debses
and Hearsts.

Thus in either party it is the character and
the personality of the leaders that will count
for everything next year. It would be fortunate if the Democrats should show courage and
convictions by making an earnest platform
for tariff revision and nominate a man of such
vigor as to demonstrate the party's earnestness
and of such balance as to command the economic respect of mankind. Then the party
