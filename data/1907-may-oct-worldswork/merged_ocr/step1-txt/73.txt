THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD

greatest perfection-what he thought. "I would
not stake my reputation answering that for anything you could give mc," he answered. "It
may be a black fox with the hairs turned silver
by the intense cold; or a black fox caught
when it is turning gray from old age; or a fox
just nipped by the trap at the moment when
his coat is affected by the season, summer coat
turning winter, winter coat turning summer.
But," he added, "I wouldn't stake my rcputation on any of these theories. I tell you it's
pure guess. All I'm dead sure of is-silver
fox is not a species."

I told this to a trapper, who has probably
trapped more silver fox than anyone else in the
Canadian Northwest, from whom I hold a
photo showing some scores of silver foxes in
his warerooms and who is now a member of
a company that annually sells 600 silver fox.
"Those scientists are all wrong. They don't
know a thing about it. It is a species; it's



MR. THEODORE REVILLON IN THE FIELD
Even the heads of the great fur houses spend much time in the wilds

a distinct kind. The fact that a silver fox
may have a litter of puppies in which there are
cross and red foxes, as well as silver, doesn't
disproveit any more than a dog's having puppies of half a dozen colors."

An interesting experiment is now being conducted by Revillon Freres, of Paris, on a rocky
island off Labrador-a silver fox farm. Only
silver foxes are on the island. There is contact with no other species, and yet the rascals
upset theory and practice by continuing to have
puppies of red and cross along with the silver.
"But the way we explain that," said the manager, "is the way you would explain a blueeyed child born in a black-eyed family something inherited from ancestors of a generation
or two back." This much only can be said
definitely of silver fox-it is never found but in
a cold climate, Labrador or the far North. Its
feet are fur-padded-the unfailing sign of the
animal of a frozen clime. Two thousand a

year, it is said, are sold in London for the
European markets. Curiously enough, on the
opposite side of America is another island given
up to fox farming. On one of the Aleutians,
off Alaska, is a blue fox farm. Cross fox also
presents a moot point. Whether it is so named
because it is considered to be a cross, or because of the brownish-black mark between its
shoulders, is not known. Another curious
point in fox life is that the best fox skins in the
world come from Labrador and Kamchatka
both bleak, desolate, rocky, fog-engirt peninsulas jutting out into a storm-beaten eastern
sea. Another distinction about fox skins is
that blue is always blue, summer and winter,
in Alaska; but the Arctic fox of the same
region turns bluish drab in summer. A fine
Labrador cross fox may be doctorcd with
chemicals to look like silver; but a gray fox of
Labrador or a blue of Alaska cannot be "chemicalcd" into a silver. Of other foxes, more
need not be said than that they are sold at the
three great world-markets in millions and
yield one of the biggest fur crops to every part
of the United States. To the Leipsic and
Nijni sales yearly come 200,000 English fox,
200,000 Siberian, 500,000 German, 300,000
Russian from other parts than Siberia, 90,000
American red fox, and over 50,000 Alaskan
