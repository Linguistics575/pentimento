A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES 9031

which were till a few years ago sleepy political
villages, it may be said of Columbia, S. C., also,
which lies half way up to the hill-country, that
it is becoming an active business centre. Man-
ufacturing and banking give it advancing rank.

SAVANNAH

Savannah is one of the most beautiful old
cities in the Union. It was laid out not only
with wide streets, but with a succession of
beautiful squares at their intersections, and in
these squares are statues, commemorating
chiefly Revolutionary heroes-Sergeant Jasper,
General Nathanael Green, and Pulaski.

One of the few monuments in the South to
an industrial leader stands in one of the squares
of Savannah. The interesting inscription is
this:

â€œWILLIAM WASHINGTON GORDON, born June 17, 1796;
died March 20, 1842. The pioneer of works of internal
improvement in his native state and first president of the
Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia, to
which he gave his time, his talents, and finally his life.

"Erected 1882 by the Central Railroad and Banking
Company of Georgia in honor of a brave man, a faithful
and devoted officer, and to preserve his name in the grate-
ful remembrance of his fellow citizens."

In several ways, Savannah typifies the well-
balanced combination which should be the
ideal development of all the old Southern
cities, of social and financial conservatism,
and the methods of modern life. They boast
of the security of their banking institutions,
not one of which for fifty years has failed. They
do not boast of their "hustle," and yet there
is the energy of a modern city there. The
old social structure has gradually yielded to
the new life of the town, maintaining its old-
time pride, sometimes under discouraging cir-
cumstances, but always giving its flavor of
dignity to the whole social structure. It is
a city that possesses a distinct character of its
own, a character that compels your respect.
It has, for instance, a public art gallery. The
spirit of the place is admirably illustrated by
these two facts: that the people have a vener-
ation for every old building and every historic
association, but within a stone's throw of
Colonial houses there has been built one of
the most attractive and well-appointed railroad
stations to be found anywhere. '

The full meaning of the water-power of the
Appalachian streams has not been dreamed
of by the public-or what their full power will
mean if the mountain forests are preserved.

But a suggestion of it is given at Savannah,
Ga. The city owns a nine-mile canal, of
14,000 horse-power. There is a large group
of big cotton mills there and, others nearby;
for Augusta is one of the great centres of this
industry. Power is sold for about $5.50 per
horse-power per year, which is one of the
cheapest rates, in great quantities, to be found
anywhere. Yet this mill community has
become also a famous winter resort; for the
beautiful old city shows the lavish plan and
wisdom of its first builders-a street 180 feet
wide with rows of trees in the middle. The
modern city has proved worthy of this spacious
plan. For instance, it is spending large sums
in making macadam roads. It retains, too,
the flavor of its old-timc social character.

THE TRADE SCHOOLS OF COLUMBUS, GA.

In Columbus, Ga., there are cotton and
woolen mills with 188,000 spindles and more
than 4,000 looms. There has been worked
out there an educational system that stands
like a beacon to all manufacturing communities.
In Phenix City and Girard, across the Chatta-
hoochee River, live the 1,500 operatives of the
Eagle and Phenix Mills, whose lives touch as
many as 6,000 individuals. The mills support
in these towns free kindergartens in large build-.
ings, steam-heated, lighted by great windows
which command a magnificent view of the
river, and are thoroughly equipped. Near each
kindergarten is a gymnasium with walls of
lattice work and floor of fine white sand.
Swings, joggle-boards, and toboggans placed
in the yards give out-of-door exercise. The
kindergartens teach horticulture, and the
flower and vegetable gardens about the build-
ings are cultivated by the children. Compe-
tent teachers are employed, and two of them
are sent by the mills every summer to normal
schools. These free kindergartens are always
filled, and "mothers' days" are joyously cele-
brated by old and young. The development
of the mill child who outgrows the kindergarten
is continued at the Primary Industrial School,
a beautiful structure in Columbus, supported
by the city, and having an attendance of nearly
one hundred mill children. Here are taught,
besides the elementary studies, handicrafts,
horticulture, and industrial subjects.

Mr. G. Gunby Jordan, the president of the
Eagle and Phenix Mills, is also president of the
Columbus school board. Free kindergartens
are a part of every elementary school, white and
