WHAT

The Commission took over all the work of
the association, proceeded with the census,
enlarged the experiment plant, opened an
attractive shop in a fashionable shopping
district of Boston, and will open industrial
shops in other parts of the state as seems
advisable. The Commission furnishes blind
home-workers with raw materials. It starts
trustworthy blind men and women in business,
with the understanding that if they succeed,
they will pay back the amount the State has
lent them. The Commission gives information
to sightless persons who seek positions. Above
all things, it urges upon each community its
responsibility for the care and employment of
the blind within its precincts. State institu-
tions can train the blind man; but his fellow-
citizens must furnish the market for his pro-
ducts, and see to it that he gets his fair share
of patronage.

A GREAT PRACTICAL WORK

In Massachusetts, happily, opposition
between the old order and the new has ceased.
The Perkins Institution for the Blind and the
Commission are working together. The shop
where the Commission puts on sale the work
of the sightless is under the same roof with
the salesroom of the Perkins Institution. The
school in changing its attitude has set an
example which other institutions cannot afford
to disregard. For the new movement in behalf
of the blind will not cease until every sightless
person in our land has the chance to earn at
least part of his support.

Philanthropists and public-spirited people
all over the country have taken up the work.
Business men are advocating it. Great men
like Mark Twain and Mr. Choate have
approved it. Governors and legislatures have
given it public sanction. Its complete success
now depends on three classes of responsible
persons: First, the directors of the institutions
and other educators; second, the trustees of
the institutions and the State Boards; third
and ultimately, the public, of which the blind
man is one.

We ask that the directors be cultivated men,
sincerely interested in the whole problem; that
if they have not the initiative to lead the way
to progress, they will accept and carry out
intelligent suggestions. We ask that the trus-

tees of our institutions for the blind be chosen
for the highest interest of the sightless, for their
competency, and not merely for name, family

or social eminence. We ask that they be men
who can afford a little time to study the prob
lems of the blind. We ask that the trustees
be so qualified that no director or teacher or
any other person can impose upon them as to
the condition, work or efficiency of the school,
or the accomplishments of its graduates. We
ask that the trustees build schools for the blind
on land suited to the peculiar needs of the
sightless.

THE NEED OF OPEN AIR EMPLOYMENT

The blind need to be placed where they can
have plenty of room for playgrounds and learn
a little of farming and gardening. Willow-
work is one of the well known industries for
the blind in Europe; but it has not been intro-
duced here, except in Wisconsin, because of
the lack of willow. Why not plant willow
on land near the institutions, and employ
blind people to trim and care for the willow-
groves? Why not let the blind raise poultry?
It has proved a profitable industry for them
in England. If these suggestions do not prove
practical, the fact remains that the sightless
need large playgrounds-out-of-door life.
Their inactivity and often the disease which
caused their blindness keep them undeveloped
and anemic. If they are to become strong,
healthy men and women, they must have a
great deal of unrestrained exercise in the open
air. In the old days there was at least an excuse
for putting the institutions in the cities; but
now, when the trolley makes the country acces-
sible, every consideration of economy and well-
being for the sightless cries out against the
blasting of the rock of crowded Manhattan for
the purpose of building a school for the blind.
Such costly building was, I am told, meditated
by the trustees of the New York Institution,
and I am glad to learn that they have abandoned
the idea. I shall be glad too, and all the friends
of the blind will rejoice, if the trustees of the
Perkins Institution succeed in their wise efforts
to move the school out in the country.

We ask the public to take all these matters
to heart and understand the needs of the sight-
less. The strangest ignorance exists in the
minds of people as to what the blind can do.
They are amazed when they hear that a blind
person can write on the typewriter, dress him-
self without assistance, go up and down stairs
alone, eat with a fork and know when the sun
is shining. But they are ready to believe that
we have a special stock of senses to replace those
