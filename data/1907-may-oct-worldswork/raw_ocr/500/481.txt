in economic and in political affairs, and al-
though we have families that have preserved and
increased great fortunes for several generations
---in spite of all our real and manufactured
scandals of plutocracy well-balanced students
of American economic conditions have no fear
of the rich. There are, in fact, occasions when
we are called on to pity them, occasions when
they are most unjustly treated, occasions even
when they are denied the share of power and
influence to which they are fairly entitled.
For instance, the American press is, as a rule,
not fair nor just in its treatment of many rich
men. It ridicules them and repeats false
statements about their personal character and
habits till the public comes to have a wholly
incorrect conception of them.

As to the danger to American social and
political life from the rich, the surest proof
that we are not yet debauched by them is the
present tide of hostility to wealth that expresses
itself in legislation and in the public prints.
The rich have won power and still hold it in
industry-as they always have and to a degree
always must; but they have visibly lost political
power and, in the best sense, they have never
had great social power among us, simply be-
cause of wealth. Just now rich men in America
are paying such penalties that few men of
moderate fortune envy them. And Socialism,
or anything like it, has for several years got its
strongest support in the United States from one
rich man who makes money and notoriety by it
and who seeks by it to further his personal
political ambitions.

That there are dangers to society from rich
men is admitted; but there are greater dangers
from fools, and there are more of them.

 

GUARDING AGAINST OPPRESSIVE WEALTH

HE Engineering N ews of New York has

made an interesting calculation, bring-

ing its figures to date, to show the old truth that

the earnings of accumulated capital cut a small

figure in the world beside the wages paid to
labor. It runs in this wise:

There are about 80 billions of income-
producing wealth in the United States. The
estimated rate of income on it all is 4} per
cent. The income, then, is about 3% billions a
year.

The calculation, based on the Census, is
that the total of wages and salaries paid per
annum in the United States is more than
IO billions.

Labor, according to this calculation, receives
about $3 to every $r received by capital.

Of course, a vcry large part of the earnings
of capital go to men who are also wage-carncrs
or salary-earners. There is no sharp division
between them and the capitalists. Very rich
men receive only a small fraction; and all the
men who live solely on their incomes receive
a very much smaller fraction of the annual
earnings of capital. This is one of the funda-
mental facts about the distribution of wealth
in the United States.

If all the existing wealth were distributed
equally among all the workers in the country,
the present average earning of $450 would be
increased by $rpy----or So cents a day.

These big figures are always interesting and
they totally disprove the usual Socialist con-
tention that the wealth of the country is really
in the hands of a few men. Still such a proof
does not reach the real reason for the Socialistic
propaganda, which is increasingly energetic in
most of the principal countries of Europe, as
well as in the United States. For it is not the
mere possession of wealth that arouses hostility;
it is the political and economic power that the
possession of wealth gives or is supposed to give.
Rich men and groups of rich men control, or
may control, "natural" monopolies and other
monopolies as well----; and power and trans-
portation and in some countries land; and by
this control they may prevent the cheapening
of these necessities. So the strongest Socialistic
argument runs.

Even worse, they may control political power
--legislation, the courts, and the like; and by
this means they may hinder the gradual growth
of individual character and influence in the
state.

These are the strong arguments of all those
schools of thought that we loosely call Socialism;
and, in the presence of these, the figure of the
production and the distribution of wealth have
little effect on men's minds. The fact remains
that rich men can combine in ways that poor
men can't. A dozen men who own or control
a billion dollars can exert more political and
industrial power than 5,000 men who own ten
billions. A million men who earn only $450
a year apiece show a colossal total earning of
450 millions of dollars. But since practically

every dollar of this is spent and must be spent
for living expenses as fast as it is earned, these
million men have practically no financial power.
One man with an income one-tenth as great
