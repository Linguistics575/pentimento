TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS 9353

.him that often, when another of the judges
was behindhand, Taft would ask for the papers
and finish up his opinion for him. He did not
overwork his force, but he set the pace for them,
and they did well to keep up. So heavy a man
night well have gotten the office-holder':, lazy
preference for the path of least resistance, but
sloth was never a characteristic of Judge Taft.
He was very methodical about taking exercise.
Every morning he went through a system of
drudgery, of gymnastic contortions, until he
was in a streaming perspiration. He par-
ticularly liked to walk. He walked to court,
and back to his home on Walnut Hills. He
walked at nodn, and on a Saturday or holiday
he and two other judges-one his old boyhood
playmate and college chum, Howard C.
Hollister-used to strike out for any point of
the compass, and briskly scour the country
for miles around.

His vacations were spent at Murray Bay,
Quebec, on the St. Lawrence. There as else-
where he came in for a nickname, and they
called him Le Petit Juge. Such a sobriquet
in connection with the gigantic magistrate must
have occurred to the piquant F rench Canadian
mind on one occasion when the board-walk
caught fire, and Judge Taft came out to see
what the trouble was. He saw that the flames
had seized on the walk, and would soon spread
to a number of cottages. Under his directions,
an agitated native set to work with a crowbar.
But it soon appeared that he would not get the
first board pried loose before the flames caught
him. Whereupon Judge Taft drew off his
coat, stooped, and took the end of the board in
both hands. He ripped it off as one might
rip apart a blackberry box. He ripped off
board after board, and saved the cottages.

Judge Taft's court was perhaps more
economically conducted than any other Circuit
Court. The earnings were large, but they
were not all spent on clerk hire. Half of these,
by Act of Congress, could be devoted to
library purposes. Judge Taft wanted a library
attached to his court, to give lawyers better
facilities in the study of cases. If an attorney
could look up the authorities and cite them,
he saved the Court's time. So Taft was
prompted by his constant guiding motive, the
best possible work, and founded the Library
of the Circuit Court, which now contains
15,000 volumes, and means an equipment
rare in Federal courts.

Economy in clerk hire did not, however,

mean that the public was getting less for its
fees. Records from the lower courts are sent
out to be printed, for which the Government
charges the litigant twcnty-five cents per page.
Judge Taft noticed that the records were taken
as they came from the printer, without any
reading of proof. That wouldn't do, he said.
The United States Government must give the
worth of its charges in his court, even if it had
to employ a larger clerical force; and his court
is declared to be almost unique in this respect,
that proof is still carefully read.

HIS FAIRNESS AND KINDNESS OF HEART

But fairness with Judge Taft always went
along as a component part with his courage.
He seemed instinctively to take the broadest
grounds, and drove straight to what was right,
even though a specific law to fit the case had
not yet found its way to the statute books. He
may even have been autocratic in brushing
aside technicalities. It is certain that he
promptly dismissed cases that had no merit.

When a man named Youtsey was tried
before him for the shameless looting of the
Newport (Ky.) National Bank, and the case
had gone to the jury, Youtsey’s attorney said:
"If the verdict is guilty, we might as well
give up, for there's not a single exception I can
file to any one of the Judge's rulings. He is
absolutely the fairest judge I have ever seen on
the bench."

That was fairness from the technical stand-.
point, suggesting an unerring legal mind, but
there was also the same quality of the heart.
A Kentucky lawyer once filed a petition to sue
a railroad for damages. His client was a
poor young girl whose foot had been partly
cut off in an accident. It was a deserving case,
but the lawyer was inexperienced. The peti-
tion was awkwardly drawn up. If Judge
Taft had taken no trouble, it could have been
thrown out on a demurrer from the opposition.
Moreover, the railroad's attorney, now a
judge, was a close friend of Taft's, and the
girl's "half-baked" counsel was unknown to
him. But Judge Taft fixed up the petition
himself, and the railroad attorney could not
throw it out. The young woman recovered
damages and her raw attorney later boasted
that William Goebel was not the only lawyer in
Kentucky who could get damages out of the
railroads.

Again, there was a case before him on appeal
that had been fought from coast to coast and
