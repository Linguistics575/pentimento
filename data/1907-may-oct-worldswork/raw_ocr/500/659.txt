OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?

have the reading habit, as a people. Some of
our younger people have the reading disease:
no other word describes the passion for the
printed page that hunches them up over books
when they had better be at play, and gives the
Optician his harvest. But even this mania for
anything to read, regardless of quality, is a
cheerful thing. It is a part of our craving for
improvement, for freedom from the common-
place, for education. By it imaginations are
stirred and ambitions aroused, that lead many
of the readers into braver fields of endeavor
than they would have dreamed were possible
in the little world around them.

Our desire to travel, too, feeds on minds
thus disturbed by images of unseen things. A
few years ago we were in the midst of "hard
times," so hard that when one young fellow
succeeded in borrowing a hundred dollars to
go East on, one of our bank presidents went to
him to find out where he got it, as he would
like to borrow that much himself and couldn't
get it. But to-day, with "flush" times, good
crops selling at high prices, and the bank
accounts fairly full, we have set our hearts on
seeing the places we have read and dreamed
about. Hardly any of us need deny ourselves
a trip to San Francisco or Los Angeles: many
go "back East''-) our eyes what "out West"
is to the Easterner: some even go to Europe, or
Hawaii, or Alaska, or Japan. We spend our
margin of savings on these expeditions, and
then usually we come back pretty well content
with our own town. We have learned that
people everywhere live just about as we do;
that folks in New York have as much trouble
and complain as much of the narrowness of
their horizon as we do; in short, that we are
pretty well off. And when we return we realize
the preciousness of old friendships and aCCUS-
tomed paths and familiar faces. What we
have seen better done elsewhere we strive to
improve in our town, but that is building up a
familiar structure, and not a reckless throwing
away of valuable associations. Travel becomes
thus part of our education in knowledge, in
the broadening of our sympathies, and in con-
tentment with our own way of living.

We are progressing in our amusements, too.
A larger proportion of our people enter into the
spirit of play than formerly-l mean the older
people. Our grown business men have taken
to handball on Y. M. C. A. courts, and they and
the principals of the schools and even some
of our preachers aid and encourage the field

meets and ball games of the boys. They even
tried golf for a time, but that did not work out
very well; it did not seem to satisfy our more
nervous temperament and our desire for
"results," and our craving for sharp com-
petition. Tennis suits us better. One club
that began in high school days continues with
almost unbroken membership now that the
boys who founded it are men with children ten
years old.

Looking back over fifteen years of pretty
rapid changes in our town, it seems to me we
have done mighty well. Ours is a good place
to live in. Here we find full satisfaction of our
social instincts-we have our friends, the
pleasant sight of familiar faces even of people
we do not know, our snug social groups and
social gatherings. Education for us, without
our town, would be less sufficient, less enjoy-
able. Our business requires such a centre.
But for the town, music and the theatres would
be difficult pleasures, rarely attained. Travel
would be less. We should have no circus, no
Fourth of July parade.

In other words, we are the focus of activities
in our neighborhood; we are to our vicinity
what New York is to the country at large, the
centre of the pleasures and benefits and con-
veniences that gather around the concentrating
point of business anywhere. We are our local
metropolis.

And the destiny of the country is bound up
in such places as this. They are a vital part
of our national machinery of government, of
industry, of commerce, of education, of democ-
racy. Where the country supplies the raw
material-men and products-we perform the
first labor of polishing them and shaping them
for greater uses. We sort them, work them
over, distribute them. We are a half-way
house toward the more complex and refined
products of civilization, and we are indis-
pensable. Our life is much the same as the
life in cities of the same size all over the United
States, and in that fact lies the importance of
understanding our life. We are the secondary
units of a coherent nationality, as important
in the unity of the country as the states.

Perhaps it is significant of the future direc-
tion of our influence that in our case the New
England stock of people, with their New
England educational ideals and their political
faith and their sterner business training, are
rather getting the better of the Southern
element.
