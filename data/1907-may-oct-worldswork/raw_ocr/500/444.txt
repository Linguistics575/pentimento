The furnishings for the House caucus room
cost the state $117,258, or enough to build
and furnish thirty 3-story brick dwellings. The
Senate telephone room, eight feet by ten and
without a telephone, is charged with $16,397
for woodwork and furniture. A cup-rack in
the Senate barber-shop cost Sanderson $325,
but was billed to the state at $3,256. An
ordinary bootblack stand with two plain
mahogany chairs cost Sanderson $125, but cost
the state $1,660.

For fitting up some rooms in the attic, Payne

inspection of some of those rooms by the writer
showed only bare quarters for draughtsmen
and the like. Fifty pairs of "specially de-

signed" andirons were furnished by Sanderson.

at $73.60 a pair. Henry S. Calvert, secretary
of the Investigating Commission, testified that

he had bought the identical pattern of goods
in the open market for $33 and was told by
the dealer that the design had been kept
regularly in stock for a dozen years. Room
402 is the headquarters of the Investigating
Commission. To furnish and decorate it cost
Sanderson just $130. But it cost the state
$1,139.04 to settle with Sanderson. Several
pages of this magazine might be filled with
instances such as these.

T. L. Snyder, of Clearfield, testified that
while State Treasurer Berry was making his
exposures last fall, former State Treasurer
Frank G. Harris placed his property in his,
Snyder's, hands, and announced that he was
ready to sell out and move to Oregon, where
the climate would better agree with his health.
Snyder also told of hardwood floors, which
had been laid in Harris's house at Clearfield
by "Sanderson's men," and of the manner in
which Harris, while Treasurer, collected $500
due from a relative by taking it out of salary
Snyder received as assistant sergeant-at-arms
of the House of Representatives.

A graft of some $7,000,000 out of a total
expenditure of $9,ooo,oocr---the exact amount
has not been definitely ascertained as yet-
staggers the imagination. ft is positive genius!
One's brain whirls between indignation at the
crime and admiration of the intelligence that
could devise it and go so intimately into details
that no scheme for getting hold of the last
fraction of a dollar seems to have been over-
looked. These men have pushed outward the
limits of human endeavor. Meekly and shame-
facedly, we are proud. It is our funeral, but
what a monumental funeral! Where else in
the world could a four million and a half
building cost nine millions to furnish?

THE INEVITABLE RESULT

The result of the insatiable greed of the ma-
chine and the revelations of monumental graft
will be the election of a class of men who will
serve Pennsylvania first and their party after-
ward. An unattached vote made William H.
Berry Treasurer, although he was a Democrat,
and it had to turn over a 4OO,OoO Republican
majority to do it. That was under the stress
of excitement. The same vote last year, acting
with the utmost coolness, forced the nomination
of Governor Stuart, who is now pushing the
probe to the bottom of the festering mass of
graft, of which the much glorified capitol is
the token now and bids. fair to be; the tomb,
