THE SCULPTORS MAcNEIL,

THE VARIED WORK OF MR. IfElCMON A. M.w?OH1,

HE recent dedication of the McKinley
monument in front of the State House
at Columbus, o., not only disclosed

to public view a superb work of art and a faith-
ful representation of the late President; it also
brought again to public notice Mr. Hermon
A. MacNeil, a young sculptor whose previous
work had received wide recognition. Insepa-
rably associated with MrOfacNcil, in the minds
of all who know him and his work, is his wife,
Mrs. Carol Brooks MacNeil, herself a sculptor
and a designer of beautiful things. This
artist family also includes two handsome boys
who play about the studio and sometimes pose
as models.

Though trained in the best schools of Paris
and of Rome, Mr. MacNeil follows the late
Augustus Sainr.Gaudens in being distinctly
American in his work. Those who have seen
the McKinley statue and who had known the

late President most intimately have been im-
pressed chiefly with its naturalness.

"Yes, that is the way he looked when we
congratulated him on his nomination,” they
say; or "He stood like that when we welcomed
him at the station the first time he came home
from Washington." It was this quality of
naturalness that first endeared St. Gaudens to
the general public when his Farragut was
unveiled; and it is the chief characteristic of
that sculptor’s statues of Lincoln and Sherman.
A foreign visitor brought face to face with the
McKinley statue would feel instinctively that
here stands a great American statesman.

In securing this result, Mr. MacNeil had no
easy task. McKinley's figure was essentially
unheroic; his head was good, but not striking;
nor were his features salient or picturesque.
But the artist went to his work with an energy
that overlooked no representation of the late
