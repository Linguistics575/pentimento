PORTO RICO'S POPULATION IN 1900, BY RACES

The proportion of colored to white is slightly higher than in
the South Atlantic States and is 5% higher than in Cuba. The
proportion of whites is higher inland than in the coast districts

the background the small mills set up on each
plantation. The miles of railroad track and
scores of little cars for transporting the cane
from the fields to the "central" are evidence
that the planter has been an apt pupil.

We have also given him some lessons in
making use of the waste products of his cane.
The tops are now used for feed; the pulp after
the cane is crushed keeps the furnace fires
going; the ash from the furnace is a good
fertilizer; that part of the juice which does not
crystallize into sugar is made into molasses;
the very dregs go to restore the fertility of the
soil.

What has been the result? Last year the
planters loaded three times as much sugar on
the ships as was sent out in 1901, and it brought
fourteen millions instead of less than five.

The tobacco planter has been to the same
school. The tobacco he shipped last year was
worth five times as much as that shipped five
years ago, and the number of cigars sent out
of the island advanced from II millions to
113 millons. Why? Partly because of in-
creased acreage, partly because of better
methods of curing and manufacturing, but
chiefly because the American has taught the
tobacco planter a new trick. Five years ago
the cigar factories could not get a grade of
tobacco suitable for wrappers; the American

PORTO RICO’S POPULATION IN 1900, BY AGE
The proportion of children is higher than in any state in the
Union and the population under ten years (31%) is higher by 3%
than among the Negroes of the South. The number of elderly people
is exceptionally low

THE MARRIAGE RELATION IN 1900
The proportion of single (including children) is higher than in

any country outside of the West Indies. Of the large number living
together by mutual consent, most could not pay the wedding fees

showed him what could be done by growing
it under cheese-cloth. Now the Porto Rican's
tobacco patch looks like a circus tent covering
hundreds of acres.

The tobacco story is yet in its first chapter.
A revolution has been going on in the factories
at the same time, and with the increasing market
comes the desire for more land. Only a small
portion of that suitable for tobacco has yet
been brought under cultivation. At the end
of another five years, cane may no longer be
king in Porto Rico.

But from the coffee planter we have taken
away by legislation what we have given by
scientific agriculture, and have taken also
most of what he already had. That the
general prosperity has not intimately affected
him is the more regrettable in view of the large
area involved. Good times for the sugar
grower help the big planters along the coast.
Good times for the tobacco grower mean hap-
piness in several coast districts and in the high-
lands along the military road. But distress
to the coffee planter affects the small planters
all over the island except in the cane districts.

All over the centre of the island in 1898, you
could see the coffee growing on the hillsides
and on the slopes of the mountains-one of
the most beautiful regions in the world. These
mountains rise to great heights; there is at

PORTO RICO’S ILLITERACY IN 1900

The percentage of illiterates was higher than in any state of then
Union, or any other West Indian island; the proportion of children
attending school was only half as large as that of Cuba although the
conditions in Porto Rico were more favorable
