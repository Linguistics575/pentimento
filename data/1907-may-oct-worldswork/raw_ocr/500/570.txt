AMATEUR HAND-CRAFTS THAT PAY

THE PLEASURE AND THE PROFIT OF MAKING BEAUTIFUL THINGS

BY
ROLLIN LYNDE HARTT

OMETIMES, when so jaded that
S neither newspaper scare-heads, nor
blood-and-thunder plays, nor even

detective stories can awaken interest, I drop in
at a quiet little shop I know of, here in Boston,
and price its wares. This pair of salt-cellars?
Twenty-eight dollars. Yonder bit of coarse
embroidery? Twelve dollars. Thatovalmir-
ror, with frame of carved wood, gilded ? Seventy-
five dollars. The undeeorated silver bowl in
the window? One hundred and twenty-five
dollars-le same price as the small cologne-
bottle in the show-case or the unpretentious
after-dinner coffee-set next to it. And the
screen beneath the mirror? A bargain---
only one hundred and fifty dollars!

Prices like those will wake up almost any-
body, especially when he learns that the quiet
little shop actually sold $40,000 worth of its
wares last year and will very likely have reached
a total of $50,000 for 1907. We have here a
wonder story made real; and the secret of it
is just this: all the beautiful and useful things
on sale in that shop are made by hand, and the
demand for hand-rpade objects is increasingly
keen-mot merely in Boston but in many other
centres. There is now a chain of handicrafts
societies reaching clear across the continent.
Yet the Boston group is the oldest, the Boston
shop the first of its type, the Boston public the
most appreciative. It is here that you see the
best development of a movement that began in
England and has been acclimatized in America
for about ten years-long enough to prove its
merits.

Express your admiration of a carved chair
or an exquisitely woven basket in a Boston
home, and your hostess will say: "I'm ever
so glad you like it; I'm so fond of it myself.
Mr. So-and-So made it, and it attracted a lot
of attention at the show last winter. Wasn't
I lucky to capture it?" As for the price, she
will not mention that, nor does she consider it
anything remarkable-tLough you know Bos-

tonians are not celebrated for wasting their
money. And presently you perceive that she
has become quite expert in her knowledge of
hand-made treasures, thinking such lore as
much a part of a civilized mortal's intelligence
as an acquaintance with good pictures, good
music, and good books. She has sought out
the leading craftsmen in their dens, it may be,
but in any case she will talk enthusiastically
of the Arts and Crafts Exposition-and why
should she not? It delighted painters, art-
critics, students, social grandees, and even the
eager multitude who seek, however vainly, to
keep "in the swim." Possibly she herself has
cultivated a gift for designing and taught her
aristocratic hands to manipulate tools. Un-
questionably she has friends, in her own
fashionable world, who have done so. They
love to shape beautiful objects to adorn their
homes. They love to give away the product of
their taste and skill at Christmas time. Mean-
while, it is thought a graceful compliment to
assume that a gift has a double charm (not
simply a double, triple, or quadruple market-
value) if the one who receives it can be told
that it was made by hand.

A solid benefit, this, to craftsmen who sup-
port themselves by their enjoyable trade.
Long something very like a fad, the
handicraft movement has at last acquired a
sound economic basis. It provides a kind of
fun that pays for itself, yielding an adequate
livelihood for the inspired workman. Looking
over the books of the Boston shop, you find
single accounts with craftsmen ranging all the
way up to $4,381 within a twelvemonth.

Who are these workmen? Graduates of
the factory system mostly. The best artisans,
seeing no advancement for themselves save by
becoming foremen or by leaving the factory
altogether, will choose the latter course. When
a man has developed superb dexterity and a
rare sense of the artistic, he hates merely to
direct the work of others. He wants to create,
