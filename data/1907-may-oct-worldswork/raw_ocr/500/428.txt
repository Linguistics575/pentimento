SENATOR JOSEPH B. FORAKER

While Governor of Ohio he appointed young Taft as Judge of the
Superior Court of Ohio, an honor unsolicited and unexpected

Mr. Taft's success and the quality of what some
men call his genius, one must remember his
untiring apprenticeship; and remember, above
all, that this apprenticeship has never ceased.

During those arduous days he was as serene
and jovial as always, with time enough, some-
how, to be the man and brother. He loved
Cincinnati for its social ideals, "where wealth
is valued less for the vulgar display it affords
and more for the opportunity it grants to do
good to one's fellow-man." He moved, as of
right, in the best circle there, and he was as
popular with women as with men; but in all
circles he was-first and most of all----demo-
cratic.

In one of his recent lectures at Yale, he
virtually describes his own activities during
these earlier years:

"The graduate," he said, "will spend as much time as
he can in learning the local situation, in becoming
acquainted with the precinct and ward leaders, in con-
sulting them as far as he can, in making himself acquainted
not only with the well-to-do and well-educated persons in
his precinct and ward, but also with the laborers, the
artisans, the store-keepers, the saloon-keepers, in order that
he may understand the controlling influences in the pri-
maries and elections of that precinct and ward."

Secretary Taft grants that this may mean
contact with undesirable associates, but he has

TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

 

"BOSS" GEORGE B. COX

Although he was young Taft's political adversary, he supported him
at the only time he has ever been a candidate for a public office

a good word to say even for the saloon-keepers,
pointing out that many of them are honest and
hard working, and that they help to influence
opinion among wage-earners. The young
graduate, he insists, must convince those he
hopes to control for good purposes that he does
not hold himself above them. On the other
hand, he has as much to learn from them as
they can learn from him, because through
them alone can he hope to understand the
motives and real feelings of the great mass of
the American people. He vigorously con-
demns the "scholar in politics," and urges
these to learn by contact "the real needs of
their less fortunate fellow-citizens."

His own contact has always been genuine
enough. It went, on occasion, even to that
of his boulder-like fist. There was no gain-
saying the big youthâ€™s prestige after he had
"thrashed" a thug-heeler or two. In primary
or convention, he was again the "Bull" Taft
of the college rushes, charging every obstacle
in his path. Old Judge Taft had recently
been defeated for Governor, and young Taft
was indignant. Politicians had traded off his
father coldly, cynically, like a chattel, so that
the boy's very first touch of practical politics
had left a sting. He was in no amiable mood,
then, when the Mt. Auburn citizens, his
