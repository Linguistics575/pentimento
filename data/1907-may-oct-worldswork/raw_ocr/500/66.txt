This is what is meant by the announcement
"sales by inch of candle." Bids were received
as the candle burned from pin to pin-quick
work, for the candle was a pencil-like thing.
The last bid was the one before the flame went
out; and to that bidder went the furs. March,
January, and November seem always to have
been the favorite months for the fur sales in
London. The furs sold were not necessarily
those recently come to market. It was a
trick, almost a clairvoyant sixth sense, to scent
the coming vagaries of fashion, and when a
rare fur was down in price to buy it up and
store it in warehouses till fashion's pendulum
swung round again, when out would come the
same raw furs to be auctioned at a higher price.

THE FUR FAIRS IN GERMANY AND RUSSIA

The Leipsic fur sales took the form. of a
great Fur Fair at Easter. Booths go up like
mushrooms. Warehouses that have been close
as dungeons for the year, hiding secrets of
famous dyeing processes from rivals and which
no one can enter or leave without being searched,
not even trusted workers, now open to the
public like a flower to spring. Thither flock
buyers and sellers from America, from Persia,
from China, from Siberia, from Japan, from
Tibet, from England, from South America.
Quaint costumes are seen in the streets. For two
weeks the fair lasts, a curious relic of bygone
customs come down to modern days. The
broker is an expert at haggling, the seller at
holding off, so that as merry a game of barter-
ing goes on as with the fish-wife who comes to
market at four in the morning that she may
have the pleasure of refusing customers till
mid-day.

Why should Germany, which is not one of
the great fur producers, be famed as a market
for furs? The secret is in the dyeing and
dressing. Whole hamlets and towns are given
over to the dressing of raw furs. Austria and
Russia produce the best squirrel skins for
linings in the world; but the skins from both
must be sent to Germany to be dressed. Some-
times the secret is in getting the oil out of the
pelt without tingeing the white fur yellow, as
in the case of ermine and white fox and Polar
bear. Again, other dressers polish the furs
with inferior grease instead of butter; or
deodorize them imperfectly instead of tramp-
ing with mahogany sawdust. Other raw fur
fairs are held in Germany, but they are for
the local product, not the world market.

THE FUR TRADE OF THE WORLD

In Russia, fairs are also the method of selling
raw furs: at Irbit in February, at Ischim in
December, at Nijni Novgorod in August.
And to Kiatka, on the border of China, blue-
gowned mandarins and merchant princes and
Chinese nobles still come for the ermine and
the marten and the sable of Siberian wilds,
as their ancestors came two hundred years ago
to barter with wild Cossacks and Siberian
bandits and Chuckchee traders and Alaskan
sea otter hunters. China produces very few
furs and those of poor quality; but the Chinese
grandee has as great a passion for fine fur
trimmings as the London grand dame for
Jager diamonds and Burman rubies. Long
before the western world had awakened to the
beauty of seal and sea otter, there was a high-
priced market for both in China. _

But the great fair of the year in Russia-the
one which is a world market-is at Nijni.
For a year, by flat-bottom raft boats, by rein-
deer sled, and by long dusty Persian caravan,
the furs have been on their way to Nijni. The
little place doubles and quadruples in size like
a mushroom city. By August, the fair is
open. Here, chiefly, are sold the furs of Asia
---Pcrsian and Astracan lamb, Mongolian
goat, Siberian sable and ermine, the great
timber wolf, the rare squirrel-skin linings---
gray almost to silver, or black and glossy as
jet-and the few, the very few of the diminish-
ing sea otter and seal. There, as Kipling says
of the Suez, East and West meet-the furs
brought down by canoe and dog-train from the
Canadian Northwest jostle with the pelts
brought by reindeer and caravan from Siberia
and Persia.

FUR-HUNTING AS A ROMANCE

To describe the picturesque side of such a
fair and all it means would require an article
by itself. Take, for instance, a piece of fine
wood marten from America. If it be a fine
specimen-dark, deep, glossy-the chances are
that it is from the far North; for the farther
north the better the fur. The only woods in
the far North are on the slopes of the Rockies.
Well, then, your trapper for this piece of fur has
set out in summer from a fur post for his win-.
ter hunting grounds. The first part of his
journey would be by canoe against stream--
except for the hard work of portaging pro-
visions over rough tracts---sheer joy to every
trapper that tramps the wilds. Then summer
gives place to autumn. Ice edges along the
