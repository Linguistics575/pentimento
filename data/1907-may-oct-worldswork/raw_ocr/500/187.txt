THE GROWTH OF THE LIBRARIES

THE CIRCULATION OF BOOKS IN SOUTHERN CITIES, TOWNS, AND SCHOOLS

BY

LOUIS R.

EN years ago, in a magazine descriptive

I of the general growth of the Southern

States, a statement of the develop-
ment of the library as an institution which
largely affected the life of the South would
scarcely have found a place. Then there was
no clearly defined, well-organized library move-
ment. The free public library, the finest pro-
duct of all library development, was scarcely
known.

But the modern library-rural, public, col-
lege, and traveling-has, since 1896, firmly
established itself as an institution making for
saner life and broader culture.

Possibly the most notable step taken has been
the establishment pf the rural school library.
In North Carolina, when the educational
qualification for suffrage was enacted, some-
thing very definite in the way of greater educa-
tional facilities for all the people had to be
provided. The legislature of 1901 equipped,
with the aid of funds raised by the school
districts and counties, at least six rural
school libraries in each of the ninety-seven
counties. By means of further appropriations
in 1903 and 1905, the number of libraries in
each county was increased from six to eighteen,
and on June 30th, 1906, 1,400 of these libraries,
containing a total of 12 5,000 volumes, were in
operation in the state.

In Virginia, the same idea has been carried
out by a system of traveling school libraries,
which has been operative since October, 1906,
and 2,62 5 volumes have been put in immediate
circulation. Libraries containing fifty volumes
each are made up from it and sent out daily
to the rural school stations throughout the state.
Every station is allowed to keep its collection for
four or six months, and then to send it back to
the state library to receive a new collection.

At the close of December, 1906, twenty
thoroughly equipped Carnegie libraries, repf'e-
senting $537,000 in buildings, were in operation
in Texas. Since 1897, Durham, Raleigh,

Greensboro, Asheville, Charlotte, and other
North Carolina towns, a score or more in all,
have established public libraries, and during
the year 1906 the five towns just named re-
corded loans totaling 200,000 volumes among
25,000 borrowers. In 19oi-6, Virginia and
Arkansas each established its first three public
libraries. Within the past six months, Atlanta
has received $30,000 for two additional branch
libraries, Louisville $2oo,ooo for eight similar
branch stations, and the New Orleans library
is just finishing its $200,000 quarters.

The most significant fact growing out of the
activities of these public libraries, however, is
not that they have been placed on a sound
financial basis and are recording a splendid
total of loans, but rather that they have tended
to reproduce themselves in other communities.
In Charlotte, Atlanta, Austin, Louisville, Chat-
tanooga, Nashville-in fact, in all the larger
towns-the public library has been a fertile
centre from which decidedly active influences
have spread. In each of these libraries, a
system of apprenticeship and general library
instruction has been maintained which has
quickened individual growth, and a publicity
bureau has been operated which has helped to
form and crystallize a fine, "general library
sentiment.

Southern college libraries have also under-
gone a complete revolution in spirit, although
their growth has not been so apparent as that
of the school and public libraries. While
they have not served the public directly, they
have served it none the less effectively by
impressing the student with the true import-
ance of the library as an institution. Quietly,
but at the same time enthusiastically, they
have worked their way up to a place of dignity
and power in college life. Ten years ago,
the library was useful to the student of literat-
ure primarily, and not to the college as a whole;
but, since it has come to be more and more a
perfectly equipped laboratory, and since the
