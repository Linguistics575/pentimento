TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

and work. He has been lucky from the first.
He was never one to originate opportunities
for his own advancement. At thirty he was
a judge on the bench. His tasks came to him.
We should say then, to be more exact and
more fair, that prodigious, untiring, effective
work reinforced luck and created it. And
with luck thrown in, this made a combination
not to be beaten by anything short of Fate.

SECRETARY TAFT'S ANCESTRY

Mr. Taft started right. Mirth was the silver
spoon in his mouth at birth. That happened
under favorable auspices half a century ago
in a new and rather exclusive suburb of Cin-
cinnati. The favorable auspices were his
parents, for he and his two brothers and two
half-brothers have been cited to prove that
brains come by inheritance. One of the half
brothers took the highest honors ever known to
Yale, and the other married the richest girl
in Ohio. The father of these five boys was a
judge and the father's father was a judge,
and here in the third generation was his son
to be a judge. The grandfather, Peter Raw-
son Taft, interpreted the law in the courts of
Windham County, Vermont, and helped to
make them in the legislature of that state.
Behind him ran a line of ancestors to English
soil. Ahead of him ran his son Alphonso, to
Ohio. The new and energetic young town of
Cincinnati was his destination. But, before
starting West, Alphonso had worked on his
father's Vermont farm until he was sixteen;
had taught school to earn money for college;
had gone to Amherst, then to Yale, graduating
with high honors in 1833; had tutored there
while he went through the Yale Law School;
and at last, in 1838, procured himself a shingle.
The next year saw it hung up in Cincinnati.

Quaint old Judge Taft, learned, absent-
minded, kindly, yet rigorous, as the present
generation remembers him, was soon one of the
foremost citizens â€˜of his adopted state, and an
especially useful one. He was insistent on public
education for that new country. The Univer-
sity of Cincinnati was menaced by an attack on
the trust fund that supported it, but Alphonso
Taft saved the fund by his talent before the
Supreme Court of the United States. He is
gratefully remembered for that to this day.
He worked zealously, though quietly, for the
development of the school system, and was
himself a trustee of the Woodward High
School, which Ns boys attended. He was

also the first Yale alumnus to be elected a
member of the Yale Corporation. He was the
trial judge to decide against Bibles being used
in the local public schools, and his dissenting
opinion became the law as announced by the
Supreme Court. He perceived that his city's
future depended on its securing trunk lines to
the strategic points, and he would not let his
fellow-citizens doze in a, complacency born of
the city's material advantages. He labored to
bring railroads to Cincinnati and he served on
their directorate or as counsel. He was
appointed, then elected by all parties, Judge
of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. Ten
years later Grant made him Secretary of War,
then Attorney-General, after which he was our
Minister to Austria, and next to Russia.

The above items all indicate that William
Taft's father had brains, but a more convincing
fact is that he learned the German language
after he had passed his seventieth year. His
was then the ideal old age of the scholar.
They say of him that "he was a man of impos-
ing personal presence, dignity, and refinement";
that " he was unostentatious, kindly, and gentle,
yet of a strong and forcible character which
won for him respect, confidence, and love."

Young Taft was no less lucky as to his
mother, She, also, came of hardy, Colonial
stock, and there was an ancestor colonel who
did the conventional thing with his regiment
at the battle of Saratoga. Mrs. Taft is living
yet, at the age of eighty, and with her vigor
of intellect remains a comforting counselor
of her son in the momentous decisions of his
life. Her ambition for him is his own-a seat
on the Supreme Bench of the United States.

SECRETARY TAFT AS A CHILD

But William Howard Taft did not leave
matters to luck. Opportunities were very
small at first, being only those that confront
childhood. A roundish, roly-poly, little chap,
he went at the great sealed universe of knowl-
edge with a grave earnestness and a big-eyed
curiosity. His brothers were bright above
the average. His neighborhood playmates
have many of them since attained honorable
distinction. In the old Mt. Auburn days--
Mt. Auburn was the name of the suburb
where they lived-it became tacitly agreed,
even then, and by old Judge Taft the most
confidently, that Will was the heir apparent in
that Court of Boyville. He was a good-
natured hulk, with bones too big for him, who
