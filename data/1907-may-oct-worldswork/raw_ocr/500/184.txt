898d THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION

yard of his Mississippi home and fitting words
to the tune, ushered in the dialect poem. Joel
Chandler Harris began to tell stories in the
Atlanta Constitution, gathered from the old
plantation' in his boyhood-and "Uncle
Remus" was soon known around the world.
Richard Malcolm Johnston saw in the light of
his mature imagination scenes of his boyhood
in middle Georgia. George W. Cable depicted
with consummate art the scenery and romance of
New Orleans. Miss Murfree, with the back-
ground of the mountains of east Tennessee,
interpreted the life of our "contemporary
ancestors." 1n the 'eighties, Thomas Nelson
Page wrote out the stories of the old times in
Virginia that he had told for a number of years
in the social circles of Richmond.' James
Lane Allen, with a hncr culture and with
an added note of idealism, set forth the
remoter life of the Revolutionary days in Ken-
tucky, and the picturesque charm of the blue-
glass country. Still later, Miss Johnston ex-
plored the fields of early colonial history, and
Miss Ellen Glasgow represented something of
the transition from the old South to the new.
Some of the most interesting figures in con-
temporary American literature are Southerners.
It is unfortunate that there has not been a
more notable fulfillment of the early promise,
but this fact may be in part attributed to the
general condition of American literature. The
most serious regret is that Sidney Lanier did
not live to complete the work that he had
planned; as it is, he has a distinct place among
the greater poets of this country.

Gradually these writers, and others who
might be named, portrayed practically all the
picturesque phases of Southern life. The
creole, the mountaineer, the "cracker," the
Negro, the old Southern gentleman and his
lady, the overseer, found their interpreters in
a literature that was full of humor, pathos,
tragedy, and that was permeated with the air
of kindly sympathy and freedom. Southern
society that had been without expression, that
had prided itself on its solidarity, suddenly
revealed its secrets to men of genius. If there
was a tendency to idealize the life of the past
and to shut the eye to certain important phases
of that life, it was but natural. The significant
point is that men began to describe Southern
scenery, not some fantastic world of dream-
land; sentimentalism was superseded by a
healthy realism touched with romance. The
writers of fiction fell in with contemporary

tendencies in American literature, following
the lead of Bret Harte and Mark Twain, who
had faithfully written humorous local sketches
and incidents. They had the creative instinct
that removed them far from the purely didactic
spirit of the older writers, With them, literature
was not a diversion, as it had been with so many
of the leisurely gentlemen of the old South,
but a business. They were willing to be known
as men of letters who made their living by
literature. Their ideals were well expressed
by Joel Chandler Harris when he said of the
Southern writer: "He must be Southern and
yet cosmopolitan; he must be intensely local in
feeling but utterly unprejudiced and unpartisan
as to opinions, traditions, and sentiment. When-
ever we have a genuine Southern literature it
will be American and cosmopolitan as well."

Not the least significant point about this
literature was that it met with such hearty
response in the North. Contrary to the idea
which had prevailed after the war, that North-
ern people would be slow to recognize Southern
genius, it must be said that Northern publishers,
Northern magazines, and Northern readers to
a large degree made possible the success of
Southern writers. In one number of Scrib-
ner's M agazine there were no less than seven
contributions by Southerners, which led the
editor to comment on the fact of "a permanent
productive force in literature in the South"
and to "welcome the new writers to the great
republic of letters." The same recognition
came from the Century and H arper's. An
article in the Atlantic M onllzly, which had been
the special organ of New England writers, said
in 1885:

" It is not the subjects offered by Southern writers which
interest us so much as the manifestation of a spirit which
seemed to be dying out of our literature. . . . Their
work is large, imaginative, and constantly reSponsiye to
the elemental movements of human nature; and we should
not be greatly surprised if the historian of our literature,
a few generations hence, should take note of an enlarge-
ment of American letters at this time through the agency
of a New South. The North refines to a keen
analysis, the South enriches through a generous imagination.

The breadth which characterizes the best
Southern writing, the large, free handling, the confident
imagination, are legitimate results of the careless yet
masterful and hospitable life which has pervaded that
section. We have had our laugh at the florid, coarse-
flavored literature which has not yet disappeared at the
South, but we are witnessing now the rise of a school that
shows us the worth of generous nature when it has been
schooled and ordered."
