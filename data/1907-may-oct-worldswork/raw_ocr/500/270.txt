tasks are so unlike save in bigness. Curzon
might have failed in Egypt; Baring might not
have fitted the Viceroyâ€™s chair so well.
Quietly, for more than twenty years, Lord
Cromer worked steadily at one of the world's
hard jobs-and it was his good fortune to be
allowed to work at it so long without Cabinet
interference. It is a significant fact that
England has entrusted the fate of Egypt to
men who knew the conditions and who were
willing to stay until the work was done. Lord
Cromer has been in Egypt almost continuously

 

_ V 7 ME
ABBAS HILMI, THE KHEIHVE OF" EGYPT

As "Viceroy'' of the Sultan of Turkey, he is the nominal ruler of Egypt

since 1877; Sir Eldon Gorst, who succeeds
him, has been in service there since 1880;
Sir Reginald Wingate, Governor-General of
the Soudan, has had a part in almost every
important happening in its modern history.
"He was among the last men that saw Gordon,
he was one of those who welcomed Slatin back
to Cairo after his eleven years' captivity in the
Mahdi's country; he was with Kitchener at
Khartum; he was with him at Fashoda when
the famous interview occurred with Colonel
Marchand." But think how many Governors
we have had in Porto Rico and in the Philippines
since 1898--and how many engineers in
Panama!

THE STORY OF ENGLAND IN

EGYPT

Since Egypt has a Khedive of its own, and
since it belongs to a nation which has a Sultan,
how happens it that a British "Agent and
Consul-General" rules the land? This is a
puzzling, question on this side the sea, except
to those who have had some reason for follow-
ing the maze of international politics.

But it is a story of finance rather than of
politics. Americans can easily understand it
by recalling a similar situation closer home.
England is in Egypt for practically the same
reasons that the United States is in Cuba
to-day.

'' But we are in Cuba merely to restore order
and to protect American capital invested there I "

Exactly; and that is why England is in
Egypt.

"But we have explicitly stated that we will
recall our troops just so soon as Cuba can
demonstrate its ability to maintain a stable
government ! "

England issued the same explicit statement
before Tommy Atkins ever left the troopship----
and there is no reason to doubt the sincerity
of the ministry that issued the statement.
Successive Cabinets from the time of Gladstone
on down have shown lukewarmness on the
subject of British occupation either of Egypt
or of the Soudan.

"But twenty-fivc years have passed, and
England is in Egypt yet!"

Yes, and we are still in Cuba-and there is
none of our elder statesmen wise enough to
tell us when we will get out or how long the
Cubans will let us stay out.

Here, in barest outline, is the story. The
details are mercifully omitted, for so good an
authority as Lord Milner remarks that "it is
not given to mortal intelligence to master at one
blow the complexities of Turkish suzerainty and
foreign treaty rights."

In 1863; Khedive Ismail came to the
throne, his brain throbbing with big ideas.
He was a royal financier and a royal spender
rarely surpassed in history. Egypt was fairly
prosperous, with revenues sufficient to keep
the wheels turning, so Ismail found his credit
remarkably good in Europe. Everybody
wanted to lend him money, and he devised
so many ways of spending it that by the
end of thirteen years he had advanced the
national debt from about $15,000,000 to
$425,000,000. During this period he and De
Lesseps had built the Suez Canal, the Khedive
retaining most of the shares.
