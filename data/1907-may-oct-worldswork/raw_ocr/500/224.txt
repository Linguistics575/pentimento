people. Under the leadership, in great measure,
of women of a conquering energy and of social
power, the whole state has been organized.
The last legislature made appropriations not
only beyond precedent but far beyond any
preceding expectation. Since its adjournment,
as many as I 50 new high schools have been
built. School-grounds are much larger, and
school architecture has been much improved.
Since August rst, last year, Mr. Eggleston, the
Superintendent of Schools, reports that new
school buildings have been erected in Virginia
that have cost as much as $330,000. Last
year more than 500 local meetings of white
teachers and 200 of colored teachers and 448

but Mr. Henry James would undertake to
describe the city in a magazine; and many
citizens of the city did not clearly recognize it
from his recent, brief, transcendental descrip-
tion. For the purpose of this running sketch,
Richmond serves as one of the very best
examples of the great change that is taking
place in the South, because all the typical
phenomena of the change are seen there, but
the change has been gradual. Richmond
has become commercial-in a sense, it always
was commercial-but it does not flaunt its
commercialism. It has not lost its old-time
character. It is and it always will be a Southern
city-not a Southern city with Western ways

RICHMOND, VA.

In a rapid and general sketch, such as this
is, of a vast and rich territory, whatever facts
you may select to illustrate the changing habits
and outlook of the people are likely to be con-
crete, commercial facts.

Consider Richmond, for example: nobody

nor any such anomaly. After you get beneath
the surface, it is more like Boston than it is
like any other city outside the South-it retains
its character. In retaining its character, it
retains some characteristics that are vexatious
to the more modern spirits; but, after all,
who would have Richmond and Charleston
and New Orleans mere repetitions of newer
cities in the North or West?

The rich men build their beautiful country
homes on their estates just outside the city.
This keeps up the old Southern country habit
and gives a good excuse for fine horses. In
general, its social life keeps its character that
has for generations made it one of the most
interesting communities in the United States.
