education is our national fetish and yet, by
government confession, the country schools
are inadequate. The teachers are untrained,
working only until they can get money enough
to do something else; having between twenty-
five and thirty recitations a day, they can-
not prevent their pupils wasting half their
time.

With Scandinavia it is not so. In Sweden,
at least, every rural teacher has a normal
education behind her. Moreover, there are
"the People's Highs." These latter are not
rural copies of the city high schools, but in-
formal institutions where farmers and their
wives, or farm hands of both sexes up to the
age of twenty-five, can get teaching directly
calculated to make them more efficient in their
work, as well as to awaken patriotism, stimulate
mental activity, and warm the heart. There
are no entrance requirements or examinations.
All instruction is by lectures and "quizzes."
The object is simply to teach the peasantry to
make the best-financially and socially-of
country life. The farmer's diet being com-
monly unwholesome, rational country cooking
is taught to the farmer's wife. She is encour-
aged to go into poultry farming and market
gardening, and to use the wild berries that grow
so plentifully all about her. The farmer him..
self learns chemistry, horticulture, dairy
bookkeeping, cattle breeding, fishing, and
surveying-along with Danish history, politics,
singing, gymnastics, and sloyd. All this, with
board, for $2.50 a week!

The best thing about the People's Highs
(which from Denmark have spread to Norway
and Sweden) is that they serve as rural settle-
ment houses or neighborhood centres. Alumni
associations are formed among the finished
pupils. Concerts, dances, and festivals are
given in the schoolhouse, relieving the fatal
tedium of farm life. University students go
out to lecture in the folkskule after our own
university-extension plan. Benevolent city
people send lawyers to sit at stated intervals in
the schoolhouses to give free legal advice to
the farmers.

And now the farmers are paying back. In
Denmark they are forming cooperative cattle-
breeding societies, cobperative dairies, bakeries,
factories, and mills. They are founding their
own country banks. F armers' unions arrange
for the collection, sale, and export of produce.
In short, they are showing some of that capacity

for concerted action which has always made
the city the better place to live in. The whole
countryside is waking. Tenement dwellers
have heard the news and are taking to the fields.
For the first time, there is a powerful attraction
toward the country.

CHEAP TELEPHONE RATES

Space dwindles; and yet I have said nothing
of the telephone system of Stockholm, the
finest in the world. You pay 21- cents for a
call at a pay station, $13.50 a year for city
service, 4 cents on the long distance telephone
for a distance of sixty miles, 46 cents for a
thousand miles, and S3 cents for the greatest
limit of distance conceivable to the Scandinavian
mind. In Stockholm everybody has a tele-
phone, the littlest shops and all but the hum-
blest homes. In 1904, New York-with a
population six times as great as the Swedish
capital-fell 2,000 behind Stockholm in the
number of telephones. And the service is
good. So much for a state telephone service
in competition with private companies.

I have said nothing of the stringent building
laws of Stockholm, which practically prohibit
fires. Cellars of stone arches, stone or iron
staircases, attics floored with fireproof masonry
and roofs of tile, metal, or slate-thee things,
in conjunction with a limited height for first-
class buildings and a prescribed size for chim-
ney flues, make fires so rare in Stockholm that
it hardly pays to keep up a fire department.
The chimney sweep and the flue inspector
ought by rights to be considered the most im-
portant members of the fire brigade. Once a
year every flue, stove, and chimney in the
capital is examined, and many times a year
every chimney must be swept out. The re-
sult is an insurance rate moderate almostbe-
yond belief. For something like $1.25, you
may insure $2,500 worth of furniture for a
year. And for $17.50 on the thousand, you
can insure your house and all others to he built
on that site forever.

And still there remains the famous Gothen-
burg system by which the Swedish Government
controls the sale of alcohol, limiting the hours
of sale, and seeing to it that no private individ-
ual shall make more than just a paying profit
out of the traffic. The rest reverts to the State.
The demon saloonkeeper is not in Sweden;
the motive for his enticements is taken from
him.
