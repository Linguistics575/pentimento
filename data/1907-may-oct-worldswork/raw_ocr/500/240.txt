and then he usually comes. The river traffic
and its great railroad systems, its energetic
business organization, the variety of its in-
dustries, and its increasing market for cotton
and the hardwoods are making it a rich city
as rapidly as some of the Western cities grew
rich; but it keeps a certain gay tendency
with its thousand acres of public parks, its
three country clubs, its two race-tracks-m
fondness for outdoor sports in general and
good roads and good horses. The point of the
story is that, along with these old loves, the
Memphians cultivate good business habits
and achieve great business success and---are
becoming rich.

There is no need, for the purposes of this
report of Southern activity-nor could there

possibly be room in one magazine-to write
of the border States, such as Maryland, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, nor
of such cities as Baltimore, Louisville, ‚Äùand St.
Louis. The point is, the waking up of the
central and lower South; for, if there be great
activity and prosperity in these states, of course
the states and cities of the border share this
movement as well as the general prosperity
of the country. Neither is Texas included,
because the story is long enough as it is and
prosperously monotonous enough; and the
whole South is bigger than the capacity of any
magazine. The older and lower Southern
States are surely enough to write about at one
time and only glimpses, at best, can be given
of them.

THE SOUTH AS A FIELD FOR
INVESTMENT

the South are very well established in

the investment world. The bonds
that represent the construction costs of the
Louisville & Nashville; the Atlantic Coast
Line, and the Central of Georgia are recom-
mended by the most conservative bankers as
"safe and solid," even though their price be
very high.

Yet the general average of the bonds and.

stocks on Southern properties is low. They
do not command the same prices obtained for
similar bonds of New England, Middle..
Western, or even Western railroads. The
causes are two-fold: first, the fact that railroad
earnings per mile in the South have never been
heavy; second, a long-standing prejudice
against the South as tt a poor country."

To illustrate the first of these causes, we show
the bonded debt per mile, fixed charge per mile,
and gross and net earnings per mile on repre-
sentative roads of the South in comparison
with representative roads of other sections.

The selection of the roads is arbitrary, the
only limitation on the choice arising out of
the desire to make the group properly repre-
sent the several varieties of railroads, trunk
lines, coal roads, local roads, etc. The six
roads of the South are also characteristic of the
whole railroad field in the Southern States.

The table is based on compilations made by
