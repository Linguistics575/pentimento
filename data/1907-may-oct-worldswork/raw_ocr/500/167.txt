cotton mill depending on steam for power finds
its fuel bill as much as one-sixth of its total
expenses, and I know one factory which ex-
pects to save $12,500 a year by substituting
electric power for coal next July.

But manufacturing progress has not been
made at the expense of agriculture. In the last
census decade, North Carolina,Virginia, and
Tennessee were among the eleven states which
made a net gain of three points or more in rank
in gross value of agricultural products. If the

is likely to become one 'ast garden for supply-

factory population with early vegetables, fruits,
and berries. It has not been many years
since it began to-ship strawberries. Yet in

advance of North Carolina manufacturing is
more notable than the advance of agriculture
it is only because it is more novel, not because
it is more substantial. From 1890 to 1900, the
increase in agricultural production was five
times as great as the increase in population,
and since 1900 this rate of progress has been
further accelerated.

For one thing, the Upland South is now
finding out just what nature intended to make
of each section and is working in harmony
with her instead of at cross-purposes. Even-

man who came to eastern North Carolina

in one year from truck crops. Even the poor-
est sand-hill land, once regarded as fit for noth-
ing except "to hold creation togethcr," has
trebled in value as its adaptability for growing
fruits and vegetables (notably peaches, grapes,
and dewberries) and its susceptibility to im-
provement have been demonstrated. "We
