 

THE LESSON OF THE RECENT WALL
STREET PANIC

railroads of the United States became

lavish in the payment of dividends.
The Baltimore & Ohio, the Pennsylvania, the
Santa FÃ©, the New York Central, the Union
Pacific, and many other companies increased
their rate of dividends.

At the same time, half a dozen of the great
roads issued new stocks. Probably the amount
of money raised by the companies in this six-
month period was more than $500,000,000.
The prices of all the stocks advanced to new
high records. The country was exceedingly
prosperous, earnings were very great, and it
looked as if there were no limit either to the
general prosperity or to the advances in the
prices of railroad stocks.

Many thousands of innocent investors all
over the country were moved to buy these stocks
at very high prices. Had the money of the
country not been pretty fully employed in
industry and in the expansion of business, there
would undoubtedly have been a period of public
purchases of stock unparalleled in our history.
As it was, much stock was bought by the public,
but nothing like the amount that would have
been so bought under slightly different con-
ditions. In making their great new stock
issues and in raising their dividends to new
high levels, the financiers counted that the
enthusiasm worked up in Wall Street by these
methods would spread over the country, and
that the public would come in and buy the
stocks, which the financiers held in perhaps
the greatest volume in ten years.

But, as early as last December, it came to
be recognized by a few financiers that the
public was not coming in. At the same time,
it began to be generally known that the Federal
Government and the legislatures of many
states had taken a stand with regard to the
railroads which threatened harm to existing
methods. President Roosevelt made no secret
' of the fact that he intended to see to it that the
existing Federal laws were obeyed by the
railroads, no matter who was hurt by such
obedience, The state legislators framed laws

IN THE last six months of 1906, the

against the railroads in great abundance. Be-
fore the end of the sessions, thirty-eight states
had passed laws that either enforced a two-cent
passenger rate or in other ways sought to limit
the power or the wealth of the roads.

Running alongside this ominous condition,
there was a scarcity of money. The United.
States was calling for more and more money
to carry on its ordinary business. At a time
when all the manufacturing companies are
expanding and when their books are full of
orders, much more money is needed by them
for working capital than at a time when their
business is dull. Also, the nation is rich.
Men who were wont to regard a ten-dollar bill
in their pockets'as sufficient daily security
against want, came to carry around with them
twenty or forty dollars. At the same time,
the Wall Street financiers were determined to
have in Wall Street a great booming market.
That, of itself, takes many hundreds of millions
of money. All these things combined brought
it about that the credit of the banking world
was strained to the limit. It was imperative
that either the prosperity of the country or
the Wall Street boom be brought to a sudden
stop.

Perhaps the legislation against the railroads
and the Federal courage in attack provided
the final push that sent the Wall Street inverted
pyramid tumbling over the verge. Very prob-
ably they did. At any rate, the month of
March, 1907, saw the most spectacular collapse
in Wall Street that has been seen in many
a year.

THE SUDDEN COLLAPSE

It came like a thunderbolt. In one day the
value of the Union Pacific common stock
dropped nearly $40,000,000. Similar collapses
occurred in Reading stock, Amalgamated
Copper, and many other stocks that belong in
the class which Wall Street calls "active."
T hat means that they are the stocks that are
traded in largely at 111 times and that make up
the bulk of the market. In two days, the value
of all the stocks traded in on Wall Street
