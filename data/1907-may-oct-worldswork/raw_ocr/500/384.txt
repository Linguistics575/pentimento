soap, underwear, stockings, shoes, bedsteads,
powder, dynamite, and structural steel; and
they have packing houses, tanneries, canneries,
and distilleries. The money for these industries
is coming in at the rate of $200,000,000 a year.

The traveller may think all this no more than
the boom in our own country spilling over the
border. Yet, by the last analysis, it is found
to be due to Mexico itself; above all, to
its statesmanship. There rages, for instance,

aptly puts it, Mexico has just begun to scratch
around the margin of its opportunities. Yet
it makes good its title to premier rank in Latin-
America. Not fifty years ago, European
troops landed to collect debts. To-day M exico
is blessed with fiscal independence. Last year
it came out $10,000,000 ahead, and there was
a reserve of $36,000,000 more in the treasury.
But it is reducing taxes, paying higher salaries,
and spending millions on public works. Thus

For which American residents and American capital are chiefly responsible

has never been so much development work as
now. It swells imposingly along every line,
dwarfing the red-blanketed Indito huddled in
stolid awe. There are the titanic irrigation
dams, the sea walls, the wheels turned by water
a hundred miles distant, the electric hoists in
shafts abandoned for centuries, the fields
that were mesquite flats only a year ago.

Do not, however, mistake this for inflation.
There is, of course, a crest to the wave and bad
times will whip off the foam, but the volume

a wise exploitation of resources has produced
taxable property. During six months, more
than 1,000,000 acres of government lands were
transferred to private ownership.

Another sign of enduring prosperity is the
building of public works. There is the new
federal postoffice at the capital, the first com-
pleted of a superb group of government build-
ings, as well as the first modern one. Here
the American postal system is being inaugu-'
rated-an official recognition of the invasion of
American methods. Even the special furniture,
