What this means may be understood from
the fact that it is equal to the value of the en-
tire export trade of the United States in 1906.

In this collapse, many honest and innocent
investors were badly hurt. Of course, the
brunt of the battle fell upon the great financial
interests, who were carrying more stocks than
at any other time in years. They lost millions
where the investor lost thousands. To them,
sympathy would be an insult. They were
merely taking the normal chances of their pro-
fession, which entails huge profits or huge
losses. Of course, they were, in some cases,
badly hurt; and, in a few cases, they became
loquacious and explained to the world in great
detail just how it happened. Some of them
laid the blame entirely on President Roosevelt.
Others blamed a clique of Western financiers,
who, they said, had conspired together to wreck
the market as part of a general scheme to
destroy the marvelous power ofHiklward H.
Harriman. Their mutual recriminations and
excuses are of little importance to the general
public. They do not bring back any of the
vanished values in the stocks sold to the
people.

This episode carries with it several important
lessons to the average man, who does not buy
stocks on margin but buys them for investment.
He wants to get his stocks at cheap prices. It
is much more comfortable to see the stock
you bought at $100 per share gradually go up
to trio per share than it is to see it go to $75.
Also, one can get half as much again for the
same money and the revenue will be So per
cent. greater. For it may be noted that the
panic has not led to the omission of many
dividends by the railroads, in spite of the huge
amount of talk among the railroad officials.

THE WRONG TIME TO BUY

If there is one lesson that is more strongly
emphasized by this collapse than any other,
it is that one should not buy stocks at a time
when the financiers are making a great " whoop-
and-hurrah," and sending the prices to new
high records every day. The huge increases
in dividends in the autumn of 1906 were
intended to induce the public to " come-on-in!"
If any investor wants to find a parallel, he may
turn to the records of 1893 and the preceding
years. In the article on Mr. Harriman, in
the February number of THE WORLD'S WORK,
a month before the panic, the lesson was

WALL STREET PANIC

written clearly enough in the
paragraph:

following

" In the next year, 1891, the masters of the financial
world had an attack of "sun-blindness" unparalleled in
history-unless, indeed, it be paralleled by the last six
months of 1906. They turned to a period of reckless
promotion and expansion. The earth was very bountiful
in crops, and the spirit of bounty spread to the railroad
lords. Twenty great railroads began dividends or in-
creased them. The public came in and bought stocks at
very high prices. The magnates fed them with rumors
and with dividends-dividends far beyond the dictates of
caution.

" This reckless carnival of prodigality was of brief dura-
tion. In 1892, the money question became a threat. Later,
crops promised failure. The restlessness of labor culmin-
ated in the Homestead riots, at Pittsburg. Dozens of
small railroads failed, because they had been forced to
incur great debts to keep up the pace in the previous years,
and because they were too fond of fighting. At the close
of the year, Jay Gould died---just before the direful harvest
came ripe to the sickle of the reapers."

All men know the results. The panic of
1893 swept a quarter of the railroads into
bankruptcy, and brought upon the investing
public the most terrible losses in our financial
history.

It is not intended to intimate that a recur-
rence of these conditions in full measure
threatens the country to-day. The Wall Street
conditions are very similar, but national con-
ditions are not at all similar. The great rail-
roads had been systematically plundered in the
year preceding 1893. They have been built
up and enriched in the years preceding 1907.
The currency question was an all-powerful
threat in 1893. To-day our currency is at
least solid. The development of the West has
placed the railroads in an entirely different
physical position from the position of 1893. It
is in the financial world, however, that the
striking parallel may be discovered.

In 19o2-r903 there was a mild repetition of
this occurrence. The United States became a
lavish country. The enthusiasm of the flo-
tation of United States Steel and a dozen other
trusts and the steady increasing of railroad
dividends brought the public in thousands
to the slaughter. The financiers far over-
reached themselves. The public faltered-
and there was a crash that even threatened to
check the prosperity of the country at large.
In each instance, the public lost millions of
dollars of savings by coming in and buying at
the urgent solicitation of the financiers, who
had inflated the prices to high figures,
