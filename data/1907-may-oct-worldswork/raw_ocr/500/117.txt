to the state Senate the removal of Otto Kelsey,
Superintendent of Insurance, for no other
reason than that Mr. Kelsey had not efficiently
performed his official duties. Mr. Kelsey was
one of the Wadsworth lieutenants. Congress-
man Wadsworth was the boss of Livingston
County. Mr. Kelsey was for nine years the
Assemblyman.then Deputy Comptroller, Comp-
troller, and Superintendent of Insurance. His
seat in the assembly is now filled by James W.
Wadsworth, Jr., the present speaker. His
great political virtue was that he always
did what he was told. When Governor
Hughes asked for his resignation, he told
the Governor that . if any changes were
desired in the Insurance Department he
would be only too glad to oblige. The Gover-
nor replied that all he wanted was a superin-
tendent who would run his department prop-
erly. This was a startling novelty to Mr.
Kelsey. It is many years since the real head
of the Insurance Department has condescended
to go on the state's pay-roll as Superintendent
of Insurance. As Mr. Kelsey explained, last
year Governor Higgins managed the Insurance
Department. Before that, Chairman Odell, of
the Republican state committee was the head
of the Department. Before that, the presidents

8915

of the "Big-Three" New York companies
had managed the Department through their
legal and lobby bureaus. When Mr. Kelsey
expressed his willingness to let Governor
Hughes run the Department, he thought he had
done all he could do.

MR. HUGHES AND THE FUTURE

This is only a sample of the difference in the
way Governor Hughes and the state politician
regard public office. Naturally, the state
politicians are combined against him. They
do not oppose his recommendations but they
delay action. They avoid test votes. The first
three months of the session, they did nothing.
They will not carry the recommendations of
his message nor his executive policy into effect
until they are compelled by public opinion,
which may not become effective unlessâ€˜the
Governor calls a special session.

In the meantime, Governor Hughes's am-
bition has developed with the combat. If the
public support which he is receiving from the
people of New York should prevail over the
resistant policy of the professional politicians,
he believes that he will be the most available
man for promotion to the vacancy caused by
President Roosevelt's refusal to run again.

STUDENT LIFE AT HAMPTON INSTITUTE

BY

ROBERT RUSSA MOTON

COMMANDANT 0F CADETS, HAMPTON NORMAL AND AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE

ENTERED Hampton Institute in Octo-

I her, 1885. Hampton was the most
beautiful place I had ever seen. I
came up through the school farm, with its acres
of vegetables, and passed the beautiful National
Cemetery where stood 4,000 white marble
headstones marking the final resting-place of
Confederate as well as of Union soldiers---
there are now over six thousand. As I saw the
beautiful grounds of the school, the water-front,
the neat, well-kept buildings and lawns, it all
seemed like fairyland to me. A few mischiev-
ous boys called out "fresh fish" -and were in-
clined to make-fun of my very small trunk,

which was entirely out of proportion to the
size of its awkward owner.

I at once presented myself to the Com-
mandant, George L. Curtis, now a clergyman
in Bloomfield, N. J. When given my entrance
examination shortly thereafter, I failed utterly
to pass, though the examination had seemed
easy. Iwas very much upset and when I
handed Mr. Curtis the note announcing my
failure, he seemed disappointed and expressed
as much to me. I remember his handing the
note to Mr. Briggs, the business agent, and
their whispering. I overheard Mr. Briggs,
whom I had all this time taken for General
