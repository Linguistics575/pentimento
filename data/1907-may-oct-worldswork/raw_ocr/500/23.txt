busy, are of secondary importance-are the
mere physical handles whereby they take hold
on the real subject. For the real subject is---
Are the railroads law-abiding creatures or are
they great forces above the law, whose attorneys
"take care of legislation by whatever means
may be most effective," and whose subordinate
officers " explain things to the general public?''
It is the lack of frankness with the public, the
lack of straightforward dealing, the yielding
to disereditable political methods-these are
the things that the public resents and builds
suspicion on. And in many cases, when the
probe of publicity has been inserted by force,
these suspicions have been justified.

Now, a railroad is a great public institution
as well as a corporation to do business, and it
must have relations with public opinion as
well as with its business patrons and with
its stockholders. The President or the owner
of a railroad and its officers are, therefore, to
a degree public servants. When they deal
candidly with the public, and when they have
nothing to conceal either in their financial
policies or in their practical management, they
have nothing to fear from the public. There
are railroads and railroad managers that are
regarded only as public benefactors. There
are even railroads which habitually win cases
in the courts for personal damages-railroads
that have the public feeling of the communities
that they serve wholly in their favor. But
these are not roads that are managed by men
whose lawyers "take care of legislation" and
whose subordinates "explain things to the
general public." They have no concealed or
questionable financial thimble-rigging; they do
not take a part in politics; they do not have
secret rates or give rebates; they simply do
their business "in the open" and their mana-
gers regard the whole public as their partners,
worthy of confidence and of frank dealing.

If Mr. Harriman himself and other railroad
"magnates" had followed this policy-had
dealt directly with the public and with public
opinion without cynicism and without con-
cealment, there would now be no acute railroad
trouble. But simply tt coming out in the open
and telling the people the railroads' side of
the matter" is not enough. They must re-
main in the open, work in the open, and keep
the public in their confidence. A few years of
such a policy as this would silence all wild
talk of governmental ownership, would make
any troublesome governmental control un-

necessary, and would cause public opinion to
have a vociferous enthusiasm for the railroads.
The people would boast of them as they boast
of schools and great works of public utility.
The roads would have public sentiment in
their favor in the courts, in the legislatures,
in the public press; and our great railroad
men would be regarded as public benefactors
and as great leaders rather than as silent and
inaccessible plotters against the public welfare.
Mr. Harriman ought to have become frank
and confidential and loquacious fifteen years
ago and been as willing all these years "to
explain the railroads' side of the matter" as
he has recently become. The purpose of the
public as it expresses itself through President
Roosevelt and through radical and even foolish
state legislatures is only to bring and to keep
the railroads "in the open." The public
goes about it in rough ways, often in unjust
ways, and it does not make proper discrimina-
tions: for a democracy uses crude and often
cruel tools. But it does insist that its insti-
tutions and agents shall be democratic---
shall live and work "in the open"; and this
result is all that it is trying to accomplish.
The little questions of rates and fares and the
like are important only as methods of carrying
this main point. And quiet will come just as
fast as Mr. Harriman's new plan of action is
generally carried into effect.

In fact, the railroad "magnate" of the near
future may, if he be wise enough as well as
frank enough, become as great a public hero
as the college president, for instance, now is;
or, for that matter, perhaps, as-the President
of the United States himself. But he will
have to dismiss his lobbies and press agents and
demean himself as a servant of the whole public
as well as of his directors and stockholders.
He must cease to be a Great Person of silence
and of mystery and of cynicism and of dark
politics and of private cars and of adventures
in the stock-market. He must become a
democratic public servant
