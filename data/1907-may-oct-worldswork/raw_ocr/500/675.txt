A UNIVERSITY PUEBLO

The students have caught the spirit of the
Indian design and take the greatest interest in
carrying out the pueblo idea. Inside the build-
ings, picturesque Indian decorations have been
worked out on the walls and ceilings of the re-
ception rooms, patterned after designs on the
Sikyatki pottery and from other sources. There
are brilliant friezes, copied from the highly
conventionalized symbolism of the pucblos---
adaptations of birds and beasts and reptiles;
the rainbow-god in his various forms; the moon-
god and the sun-god and unnumbered other
gods, all composing an interesting study in the
art of the ancient Indians. Mural decoration
reached a high development among these an-
cient peoples. Many quaint and beautifulde-
signs have been discovered in various cave-
houses and cliff-dwellings, and on the faces of
cliffs in many places.

The University has made use of black hard-
wood " swastikas" (Indian good-luck symbols),
hanging horizontally, as frames for the electro-
liens. In the students' rooms are Indian rugs,
pottery, and baskets, easily procurable from the
many Indians living in the vicinity of Albu-
querque. Bows and arrows, moccasins, and
bead-work curios hang on the walls alongside
photographs of harvest dances and sarrcd cere-
monials. In the main reception room of the
women's building is a large vase brought from
the ruins of Sikyatki and bearing one of the
interesting emblematic designs which has been
made use of elsewhere.

The complete pueblo scheme, as worked out
by Dr. Tight and the architect, Mr. E. B.
Cristy, is a practical one. To the two dormi-
tories now in use others are to be added on a unit
system as the University grows. Plans and
specifications have been completed for the entire

group. The existing laboratories and halls will
be remodeled along pueblo lines and all the new
buildings will follow the same style.

Two immense, irregular rectangles, each a
model of a complete communal city, will face
each other across a fifty-foot trec-lined avenue.
Each of these rectangles will consist of about
six buildings, so connected that when the whole
is finished it will appear to be one building. At
the back of the rectangle, the main building or
highest part of the pueblo will be three stories
and a half in height. This will be used as di-
ning room and kitchen, with laundrics, provision
rooms, storehouses, and other 'd eeessories of the
"mess-hall." Adjoining this highest building,
on each side, will be another, two stories and a
half high-jo-ko-na,'' the women's dormi-
tory, being one of these. At the rear corners will
be "L"-shaped buildings, slightly lower, the
men's dormitory having been constructed with
this end in view. From the high building at the
