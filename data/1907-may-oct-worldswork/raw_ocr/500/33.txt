THE LESSON OF THE

Could any lesson be stronger? Of course,
the lesson is negative-it is a warning against
buying at the time of great enthusiasm, ad-
vancing dividends, huge new creations of stocks
and bonds. It should be written by every
investor at the top of every page in his
stock-ledger.

BUYING AT THE EBB-TIDE

The second great lesson is a positive one.
If a man has patience to go back to the collapse
of 1893 and that of 1903, and study them with
an eye on the sudden collapse of 1907, this
lesson also becomes plain enough for the average
business man to see.

The men who bought the railroad stocks at
the worst period of the panic of 1893 are to-
day rich men. The Harriman fortune is
founded upon the purchase of a bankrupt
railroad at that time. In a lesser measure,
one may name a dozen millionaires who
made their fortunes by similar purchases
on a smaller scale. In a still smaller way,
scattered over the country, one will find
thousands of men who are to-day comfortable
because they bought such stocks at that time.

The same holds true of the collapse of 1903.
Any man who bought standard railroad stocks
in that year or in 1904 has seen his capital grow
astonishingly in the intervening period. Even
if he has kept his stocks through to the present
time, his revenues are, in many instances,
largely increased through larger dividends.

In all human probability, the phenomenon
of 1893 and of 1903 is to-day being repeated.
Of course, there are differences, but the funda-
mental facts are the same. Perhaps in the
next year one or two of the weaker railroads
will have to eliminate their dividends. The
stronger roads will not even reduce them,
unless the most astounding occurrences should
take place in the country at large. If con-
ditions can be judged at all, they mean that
the shrewd investor now has an opportunity
to make wise purchases of stocks.

The third lesson may be put very briefly,
thus: "Under no circumstances must the
investor strain himself in buying stocks or
bonds!" This is all-important. Each of these
collapses was caused by the straining of credit
and money-resources. One must judge for him-
self just how far he can rightly go. A business
man who invests his whole surplus in stocks
or bonds is a foolish business man, for the ex-
haustion of working capital led to half the

"rcceiverships of 1893 and 1903-04. What is
true of the company is largely true also of the
business man.

Neither should the very small investor take
all his money out of the savings bank to buy
either stocks or bonds or real estate. Savings
are an anchor to windward. They are not
merely an investment; they are an emergency
fund, to meet sudden and unlooked-for evils.
Enough of them should be kept safely in cash
to meet such emergencies. The rest may be
invested.

One hesitates to draw another lesson from
this panic, because it is a lesson ofiwide appli-
cation and of supreme importance alike to
business man, trustee, investor, and saver of
small funds.

Talking, one day, with a well-informed man,
about the reason why the public nearly always
sells at the bottom and buys at the top, I used
this illustration:

"Suppose you are a stockholder in the

Magazine. That magazine has
had a great boom. Its circulation has been
increasing by thousands a week. The revenues
are climbing. Under these circumstances,
you will not sell your stock at any price. No
one could induce you to get out of a business
under such conditions.

"By-and-by, the boom stops. Subscriptions
dwindle. In one week you lose 5,000 sub-
scribes, and gain only 200. Just as naturally
as the sun rises, you begin to look about to
find a buyer for your stock. It comes into
your mind that you will get whatever you can
get out of the ruck. Finally, you turn it over
to another partner made of sterner stuff-and
get out. For a while you congratulate your-
self upon your shrewdness. Perhaps, in the
next year or two, business revives. In the end
you may go to the man to whom you sold and
buy it back again at twice the price he paid.
That is human nature. It is also the reason
why the public sells at the bottom and buys
at the top." That merely points the lesson of
the panic of March. Its application may be
left to the individual who reads it.

Of course, there are many other things to
be learned from this episode, but most of them
apply to special classes of individuals rather
than to the innocent investor. Above all else,
the panic taught caution. Had not the great
banks of New York been cautious for weeks
preceding it, there would have been a dozen
great failures in Wall Street, and the Baring
