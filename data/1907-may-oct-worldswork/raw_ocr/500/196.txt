supply is not sufficient. Many of the mill
hands do not work constantly. Some of them
live no better than they did in their mountain
homes, and to maintain that standard they
do not have to work all the time. They move
about from mill to mill. I saw a woman and
a boy come into the superintendent's office of
a Spartanburg mill to ask for an advance on
their wages. On being questioned, she named
eight mills at which she had worked during the
past two years. A family in Charlotte, N. C.,
moved four times in one week. To keep their

much production from three looms as two poor
workers can get from four.

"Some time ago," said one mill president,
"they may have had child labor because it was
cheap; but, considering what they do, the
children that work now are the most expensive
help we have." The mill men's position
is, that the best place for the children is in
school; the next best place (for those over
the legal age) is in the mill, and the last place
for them is running loose in idleness.

which they did not do formerly. Those that
work best are those that live best, and most of the
mills are doing all they can to encourage both.
Practically all the larger mills in Spartanburg
County maintain free schools for the children
of their villages. At a little North Carolina
town, the mill superintendent was asked if he
objected to a graded school near his mill.
"No," was the answer; "the more children
you get to go to it, the better I like it. Lwant
intelligent labor." All the mills want this,

Unconsciously the mills are doing more to
stop the labor of children and send them to
school than any other influence. In North
Carolina, for instance, in 1880, before there
were many mills, 56 per cent. of the male chil-
dren between IO and 15 years of age were at
work, mostly on the farms. In 1900, after so
many boys had gone into the mills as " doffers,"
the percentage was 55. But in 1900, when
the working children were congregated, people
at once recognized that they were working and
that they were not at school. A public
