A NEW KIND OF INSURANCE

HOW ONE COMPANY INSURES ITS MEN AGAINST ACCIDENTS

BY

ARTHUR B. REEVE

back on when wages stop and expenses

double. The only sort of insurance
that most of them know is industrial insurance,
the most expensive in the world, and they
have to die to be benefited by it! True, they
find, often to their cost, that the employer
knows of another kind of insurance; but only
in the case where he has been guilty of negli-
gence do the men profit by it. The negligence
may have been that of a fellow servant; there
is no recovery. Even if the man has been
negligent himself, that does not make his suffer-
ing or that of those dependent on him the less.

In any case, the employer seldom figures ex-
cept as he is forced to do so. That is why it is
interesting to note what one large corporation
is doing for its employees that are injured,
in order to help them over this period of storm
and stress.

Somewhat more than a year ago, the largest
power generating plant in New York began
the experiment of dealing with the men who
are injured in their employ-not according to
the legal liability incurred but according to the
moral liability.

Among its 3,800 men, with a pay-roll of about
$2, 500,000, there were, in the calendar year of
1906, 751 accidents; and the company cared for
every one of them at a cost, in wages paid, of
$13,056.82. Of these 751 cases, 459 were
accidents of such a nature as to lay up the
victims, resulting in the payment of wages
full time until the men returned to work, to the
equivalent of 1,223 weeks' wages. These
cases included men injured by their own, their
fellow servants,' and the company's negli-
gence. In 84 more cases where the company
had absolutely no liability and the men had
been grossly careless, half-time was paid.

The men received far more than they
would have received under the system of
liability insurance, for, by the most liberal
construction, in only 51 cases was the com-

FEW workmen have resources to fall

pany legally liable. In 613 cases, the em-
ployees themselves were clearly at fault, and
in 87 cases it was clearly the act of a fellow-
servant. That is to say, the cost of some
700 accidents was accepted by the corporation,
which, according to strict legal rules, need not
have been accepted.

Here is how it turned out: During the year
from May I, 1905, to May I, 1906, the premium
that the company would have paid for liability
insurance would have been $21,396.19. Of
this, the sum that would,have been returned
by the insurance company for allowance of
expenditures for "first aid" would have been
$1, s 38. That is, there would have been paid
$19,858.19. But, instead, the company as-
sumed the handling of its accidents itself,
with the cost in doctors' bills of $6,297, and in
druggists' bills of $1,122.17, paying the wages
of the men while they were disabled to the
amount in that fiscal year of (ho,8ir.33-a
total of, $18,270. So. That is to say, the cash
saving was $1,587.69.

One of the officers Was asked why they had
given up settling along the line of strict legal
liability. "This business is one that calls
for extreme fidelity on the part of the men," he
said, " in many emergencies, for instance, there
is real risk. The moving machinery and the
electrical feature make the occupation hazard-
ous. The employee must feel that his welfare
is assured or he might falter at the critical
moment. This may not be the cheapest way
to settle, though it seems to have been so far.
That will take five or six years' experience to
determine. But it gives us a free hand to deal
justly with our employees so that they will
know that they are going to be taken care of
if anything happens to them. We can treat
each case upon its merits and not according
to legal necessity. Even if it does turn out to
cost more than the legal liability would, it
will pay, we think, in increased efficiency of
the men."
