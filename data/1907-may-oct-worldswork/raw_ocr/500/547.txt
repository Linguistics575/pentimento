I it takes all the energy a man can muster.

It takes more than mere energy, too:
it takes the wisest possible investment of that
energy. A man must know when to spend
himself and when to spare himself. Success
lies as much in knowing the time to quit as in
the ability to keep plugging on in the face of
everything,

That is why the various problems of fatigue
are important. Fatigue isn't nearly so simple
and plain-as-day a subject as we are likely to
think. When we "just feel tired," we haven't
by any means finished the story; there are a
great many varieties of feeling tired, and each
variety has a different bearing upon the business
of efficient living.

Take the most obvious cage of all-"muscu..
lar" fatigue. In the laboratory you can
stimulate a bit of muscle to contract over and
over again until finally it stops giving you any
response. But if you take the muscle out of
the apparatus and give it a bath in a warm
salt solution, it will begin reacting again with
almost as much snap as it had in the first place.
You have washed out the fatigue. It won't
keep it up so long this time, however; and a
second bath will have less effect than the first.
Finally, you come to a point where even a
bath doesn't help the situation. That is
muscular exhaustion, and, physiologically
speaking, it is an entirely different phenomenon.

As a matter of fact, however, the kind of
fatigue that we ordinarily call "muscular"
isn't in the muscle. We are simply using a
handy term. When a nerve centre has worked
a group of muscles until they refuse to respond
any longer, the trouble is usually with the con-
trolling battery and not with the thing it runs.
If you put an electric current directly on the
nerve that feeds the "fatigued" muscle, at
once the muscle will begin to work again.

The part of us that goes under first is the
nervous part. We do not use up the energy

of our muscles; we exhaust the battery they
are "connected up" with.

Emotional fatigue is another variety. Sev-
eral times in my life I have been through one
hard experience after another-losses in the
family, for example-and when the first shock
came it seemed as if I couldn't endure it.
Then the next came, and the next. I simply
felt numb. I had nothing left to react with.
That was emotional fatigue.

And we know how it works out in the opposite
direction, too. We have seen it at Christmas
time in the little folks. Long before the tree
is unloaded of its treasures, they are usually
so exhausted by their burden of happiness
that they hardly show any interest in the latest
additions to their pile of presents.

Children make excellent laboratory material
in the field of emotional fatigue, because the
majority of their emotions get full play as long
as they last. I have seen children yield to
blazing anger until they reached a point where,
out of sheer exhaustion, the anger disappeared,
even though the original cause of it was just
as much in evidence as ever. This wasn't
the kind of exhaustion that follows intense
physical effort-the violent use of hands,
muscles, motor areas. The emotional engine
had simply worked off all its steam. It couldn't
get into action again until the fire was stoked.

Will fatigue presents some of the biggest
problems a man has to face. If it were not
for will fatigue, we could all of us lead perfect
lives. Any minute that I choose to do so, I
can live perfectly. I can live perfectly for an
hour, if I keep at it hard enough. But I am
pretty sure that I couldn't do it for a week.
I have made the experiment more than once--
unsuccessfully. The strain is too great; my
will gets tired, and then it "caves in." I
slump down to a lower level for a while, and
my volitional faculties take a rest.

So far as my knowledge of such things goes,
there is nothing outside of us that forces us to
