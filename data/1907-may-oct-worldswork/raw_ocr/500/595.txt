MR, TAFT’S PRESIDENTIAL PROGRAMME

SECRETARY TAFT'S speech at Columbus,
Ohio, which was accepted as a formal
declaration of his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for the Presidency (and which was
so meant), lacked the quality of a bugle-call;
but it did not lack definiteness nor sincerity.
As a member of Mr. Roosevelt’s Cabinet, he is
in hearty accord with Mr. Roosevelt's aims.
If he were not, he would not retain his portfolio.
He is not a man to serve where he does not
approve. Since he is in accord with these
policies, the burden of his speech was necessarily
an explanation and approval of them; for these
are the subjects that now demand discussion.

He approved the Federal regulation of rail-
road rates and favored amendments to the
present law which should enable the Interstate
Commerce Commission to classify traffic and
to bring about uniform classification; and he
approved the Federal regulation of interstate
railroad capitalization and securities. Such
supervision, he explained, was not socialistic,
but preventive of socialism. He added:

" I am opposed to Government ownership---

" First, because existing Government railways are not
managed with either the efficiency or economy of privately
managed roads and the rates charged are not as low and
therefore not as beneficial to the public.

"Second, because it would involve an exp'enditure of
certainly twelve billions of dollars to acquire inter-state
railways, and the creation of an enormous National debt.

"Third, because it would place in the hands of a reck-
less executive a power of control over business and politics
that the imagination can hardly conceive, and would ex-
pose our popular institutions to danger."

He would "restrain unlawful trusts with all.

the efficiency of injunctive process, and would
punish with all severity of criminal prosecution
every attempt on the part of aggregated capital
through illegal means to suppress competition."

He favors a Federal graduated inheritance
tax, when the Government should need the
revenue, and a graduated income tax if the
Supreme Court should reverse its decision
against such a measure.

He spoke for a. revision of the tariff after the
next Presidential election.

There was, therefore, nothing very new in
the speech. Yet it was none the less genuine.
It was the speech of a man who spoke his own
convictions and it put Secretary Taft in a
definite relation to every important public
question of the day. If he become President,
essentially the same policy will be pursued as

FOR IMPROVING

THE POSTAL SERVICE 9393
President Roosevelt is pursuing, with a differ-
ence of temperaments. This is not news to
any one who knows the Secretary's personality
or thought: indeed, the speech lacked novelty
only because his views were already known.

The action of the Republican Convention
next summer can be only guessed at. But
as good a guess as any is that Mr. Taft will be
nominated, thanks both to his own positive
qualities and to the kind of enemies that he has
made in Ohio.' His visit to the Philippines
and his journey around the world will be likely
to add to his popularity. By the way, his
travels since he became Secretary of War go
beyond all precedents set by high officials in
our Government, or perhaps in any other
government.

PLANS FOR IMPROVING THE POSTAL SERVICE

OSTMASTER-GENERAL MEYER has

set the task to make several far-reaching
and long-discussed improvements in the postal
service. Among them are these:

(r) He will urge Congress to establish a
domestic parcels-post to carry parcels weighing
as much as ten pounds. This recommendation
will be opposed by what Mr. Wanamaker,
when he was Postmaster-General, called "the
six reasons" against it-namely, the six
express companies. A vigorous opposition
will be made also by some country merchants,
because a parcels-post would increase the busi-
ness done by mail by the great department
stores in the cities. But it would be a great
convenience to the public.

(2) He will make an effort to establish a
system of postal savings-banks. This move-.
ment will doubtless incidentally lead the states
that do not sufficiently safeguard the deposits
in the savings-banks to revise their laws govern-
ing those institutions. To this, too, there will
be vigorous opposition. It will doubtless be
the most difficult item in his programme to
carry through. We have already given the
Filipinos postal savings-banks.

(3) He will revive the old postal notes, but
with some modifications. These will be limited
in amount to $5, or possibly less, and will be
made payable to individuals instead of "to the
bearer."

(4) He is experimenting with a, slot-machine
for selling postage stamps. If it proves satis-
factory, the Government will probably manu-
facture the machines. One-cent, two-cent, and
five-cent stamps will be sold.
