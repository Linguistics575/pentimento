usual method, and that a very small propor-
tion are born with such mental and physical
defects as materially affect their progress.

THE CRUCIAL TEST

If one wishes to know whether his school
is really educating the children as they should
be educated, let him make an invc(igation.
The test is easy. Sometime after the begin-
ning of the term, let him go into the rooms and
ask the teachers if they have pupils who are
not fitted for the work. In every class will be
found a number who are dragging, and a
number at the head of the class who can easily
do the work though absent every other day.
If this condition exists, the friends of the
schools should insist upon such a change as
will make it possible for the teacher to give
tasks and instruction suited to all the pupils
in the class.

In New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Bos-
ton, and other cities, I have sought in vain for
a class where the teacher thought all were
fitted for the work. Most said they never had
been and never expected to be so fortunate
as to have such a condition. At the Rhode
Island Teachers' Association I asked 2,000
teachers how many had in their classes only

those who should be there. Not a hand was
raised. Seemingly every hand was raised when
I asked how many always had pupils who
should not be where they were. Similar
results were shown when I lately asked 1,000
Washington teachers the same questions. I
received no different answers from any body
of teachers of whom I asked the questions.

TEACHERS AND PUPILS DIFFER

Since all admit that teachers vary greatly
in many ways affecting their efficiency, and
none dare deny that the children in every grade
differ widely in many ways affecting their
progress, is it not an injustice to expect all to
move at the sa'me rate? Why should pupils
be put in educational mills and the teachers
be expected to grind them out alike? Who
will assert that individuality is not of more
importance than uniformity of taste, of grading,
of ability, of character, or of aspiration? Is
not individuality the divinity of the child which
should be watched for, carefully studied and
lovingly guarded? Is it not of vital importance
that the friends of the schools should insist
upon an immediate change in the method of
organization, that all may advance as they
have the individual ability and opportunity?

ACCURATE AND CONSTANT KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS DONE INSTEAD OF FITFUL REFORMS

WILLIAM H. ALLEN

SECRETARY OF THE BUREAU OF MUNICIPAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK

[The Bureau of Municipal Research in New York is an
organization to find out and to keep the public informed of
the facts about government, as expert bookkeepers enable
managers of business concerns to know how they are doing.
The trustees of it include such men as Messrs. E. R. A. Selig-
man, R. Fulton Cutting, Carrol D. Wright, and Richard
Watson Gilder. In this article, Mr. Allen explains its
method of work under the direction of Mr. Henry Brubre.)

HE main trouble with good city govern-

I ment in the United States is that it
comes and goes by fits and starts. A

good administration is followed by a bad one;
and so on. The reason is the lack of a clear
knowledge by the people of the real facts about
city government-whether it is good or bad.
There is no mechanism whereby facts may be

carefully investigated and presented in con-
vincing form to the voting population. The
Bureau of Municipal Research in New York
is an attempt to remedy this defect and the
results of one experiment show the manner in
which it does its work.

A SPECIMEN INVESTIGATION

The Bureau determined upon an investi-
gation of the administration of Mr. Ahearn,
the President of the Borough of Manhattan,
on account of the magnitude and importance
of its operations. The investigators started
out with no evidence that there was corruption,
with some little evidence that there was inedi..
ciency, but especially with a full appreciation
