of the harbor front, for example, a half-mile
stretch of embankment has been left un-
touched; rising to a height of several feet
above a beach, this presents the identical pros-
pect which met the eyes of the first colonists
at their approach to these shores. At the
western extremity stands a clump of towering
pines, a worthy memorial of the great primeval
forest, offering a touch of severity that em-
phasizes the lavishness beyond.

Turning from the water front, with its miles
of trees and flowers and shrubs and vines, the
prospect stretches out in pleasing perspective.
Broad avenues radiate in every direction,
terminating in secluded spots as inviting as
any that the solitude of the forest can offer.
Extending through these grounds is a beautiful
winding walk, called "Lovers' Lane," with
overhanging vines and flowering plants, and

and winding in the same general direction is the
"Canoe Trail," a beautiful stream of water

has constructed, at a cost of $400,000, two
great piers, with towers for lighthouses and
wireless telegraphy. These piers are each 200
feet in width and extend nearly half a mile;
at their extremities they are connected by a
pier of the same width. This latter pier is
arched in the centre to permit small craft
to come and go. On the shore line are
landing stations of handsome design. A
million incandescent lights illuminate the
entire length of the pier-way, and monster
searehlights surmount the towers. The en-
closed harbor affords a measurement of ap-
proximately forty acres. In the basin within
the piers, water sports -are conducted, while
the ships at anchor in Hampton Roads may
be reached by boats from the landing places.
The harbor illumination by night is very
beautiful.

The Jamestown Exposition differs in one
respect from all other expositions-most of
its buildings are to remain permanently.
Seen from a distance, the effect is that of a
beautiful group of colonial architecture, this
