the temporary and the permanent resources

should be considered separately. Tempo-
ra.ry resources are those that lie idle until used,
and whose product is then not income
but converted capital. Permanent resources
are farm lands, water-powers, etc., whose
product is income.

In the list of convertible assets bestowed by
Nature upon the Southern States, mineral
wealth and timber are the two great items.

About one-seventh of the mineral production
of the entire country comes from the Southern

IN forecasting the future of the South,

mineral, the South produces one-fourth; and
of iron, about one-ninth. Its total coal re-
sources amount to nearly 600,ooo,ooo,ooo tons,
or more than one-fourth of our estimated coal

reserve, as follows:
Southern Appalachian Field, including SHORT TONS
West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, east-
ern Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and
Alabama ............................... 42 5,8 52,000,000
Southwestern Field, including Indian Ter-
ritory, Arkansas, and Texas Carboni-

ferous ................................ 141,946,ooo,ooo
Texas and Alabama Lignite ............... 3o,ooo,ooo,ooo
