range is practically everywhere in North
America, and over the northern half of both
Europe and Asia. A few years ago, fashion
would have naught to do with mink, and the
fur went begging at a few pennies a pelt.
Recently fashion has approved it and prices
have jumped to $1 and S4 and $5 and $7 for
the different grades, with the result that half a

United States to European markets. Otter

men's coats, the Canadian otter especially,

the fur. While it is distributed widely over
three continents, it seems never to have been

come from Siberia; or bear, gathered in the

And we have not y l touched on the three
