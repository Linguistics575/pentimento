Thus this historic Exposition is held in a land
of historic memories. "

The Exposition will emphasize-really for
the first time in the minds of the whole Amer-
ican people, who know their New England
history far better than they know their Southern
history-the romantic and interesting story
of the great Southern colony. In fact, this
may turn out to be the great-the very great--
permanent effect of the Exposition, that the
beginning and early centuries of Southern life
will take their proper place in popular knowl-
edge; and it will be sure to stimulate the
study of Southern history.

THE BEAUTY OF THE GROUNDS

The Exposition grounds have a water front-
age on two sides-Hampton Roads and Boush
Creek-and along this prospect for two and a
half miles stretch four rows of trees. The
other two sides are enclosed by a wall of living
green and scarlet, constructed in an original

five feet high; above this are a number of
strands of barbed wire, making the fence about
eight feet high. Strung upon cross timbers
that extend two and a half feet on either side
from the top of the posts are five other strands
of barbed wire, making it almost impossible
for any one to get through or over the fence.
But all this framework is hidden beneath a
mass of verdure that makes it look like a huge
hedge fence in mid-summer. At each post
is planted a trumpet-vine; between each post
is a crimson rambler rose; and between the
trumpet-vines and crimson ramblers, honey-
suckle has been trained. The vines were
planted in May, 1905, and, as they are native
to the South, they have attained full growth
and now form a mass of green begemmed
with fragrant flowers that charm the eye and
fill the air with fragrance.

For three years, the landscape gardeners
have been transforming the beauty of this
wilderness into a wilderness of beauty. All
the natural charm of the site has been saved
and augmented. Upon the eastern margin
