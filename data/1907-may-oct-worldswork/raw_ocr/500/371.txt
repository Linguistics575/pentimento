dimes. This waste is paid by the policy-holders
and diminishes the benefits that they receive.
There is thus every reason to desire a more
economical system of insurance for small
amounts.

The Massachusetts Savings Insurance
League proposed to remedy this evil by allow-
ing every savings bank to esta blish an insurance
department and to sell life insurance policies
in sums of $500 and less at cost, thereby giving
the depositors the same benefits in life insurance
that they have in the custody of their savings.
A bill to that effect was submitted by the
League to the Massachusetts Legislature and
has become a law. There are to be no agents,
solicitors, or collectors for the insurance depart-
ment any more than for the savings depart-
ment. The same trustees will have charge
of both. The same othees will serve both
departments. The same supervision and rt-
strietions in regard to investments, accounting,
interest and profits will apply to both. Any
depositor in a savings bank can have his life
insurance in connection with his deposits and his
premiums charged to his deposit. He has
simply to show physical fitness. A separate
account is to be kept of the savings funds and of
the insurance funds; and any savings bank
desiring to do an insurance business must
provide a special expense and insurance
guarantee fund which must be kept intact.
The form of policy wilt be prepared by a state
actuary who will also prepare a table of rates
and, in connection with the state medical
director, will prescribe the rules for the t'urcept-
ability of the applicants.

This is a most interesting experiment.
It will enable the same class of working people
to whom the savings banks have been so bene-
ficial to insure their lives and the lives of
members of their families on terms that are
economically sound. The League has not only
secured the passage of the act, but has induced
many leading savings banks to announce their
intention to avail themselves of it. It is com-
posed of two former governors, two bishops,
a mayor, two judges, the president of the
Boston Central Labor Union, the president
of the Associated Charities, the chairman of
the Good Government Association, a Harvard
professor, the secretary of the Childrcn's Aid
Society and several bankers, business men and
lawyers. The best way to solve many pressing
economic and social problems is for such men
as these to get together and undertake them.

IO SEND OUR MANUFACTURERS ABROAP.

N' INTERESTING and possibly prac-
tical suggestion has been made by our
Consul (2‘ Hanover, Germany, that picked
groups of American manufacturers make ex:
cursions to foreign countries to promote trade.
A tour should be carefully laid out. Accurate
information about al' places to be visited
should be compiled in advance. Arrangements
should be made for the reception of the visitors
so that they may get accurate local information
on their arrival. The suggestion goes on:

'Some of the benefits that may be gained by such a
trip are an interesting, valuable and pleasurable voyage,
educational advantages in the way of broadening the view
of the American manufacturer, direct business secured
and acquaintance established, the study of markets, .needs,.
methods, and processes of foreign manufacturers and
merchants, and the awakening of sentiments favoring
reciprocal trade relations generally."

This is a plan that, like most plans, will
depend wholly upon the wisdom with which
it shall be carried out. If the right kind of
American manufacturers go to countries and
cities where markets for their products can be
built up or enlarged, and if they study local
conditions and even local prejudices sympathet-
ically, it would be hard to overstate the benefits
that might follow. American manufacturers
or the trading companies through which they
work already have agents or send salesmen to
all important markets; but agents and salesmen'
are not themselves manufacturers, and there is
a difference. One hindrance to the growth of
our foreign trade in many markets is the
ignorance of those markets in our factories.

FOR THE BEAUTY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND
PLACES
A"2Hfii1'y),iri?,f?, resident of one of

our inland cities was lately driving a
visitor about the town. They came to a series
of new bridges over a stream. "Along, this
stream we are building a drive, and this is the
kind of bridge that the city has decided shall
be built at every street. Do you like it ?"

'' It is substantial.”

"Yes, but it is not really beautiful. I tried
to have the choice of the design postponed
until a thorough study could have been made
of bridges for sneha plnco---a study by persons
of the best artistic training who should have
been authorized to search the whole world
for suggestions. ' .
