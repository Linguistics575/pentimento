THE PEOPLE, THE RAILROADS, AND THE GOVERNMENT

the enlightened legislator must be to correct
as far as possible existing errors, to make a
repetition of them impossible, and to establish
a permanent basis upon which the people
and the railroad can transact their business
in the future without injustice either to one or
to the other.

The current created by the existing agitation
must be turned into a safer channel, or great
harm will be done, both to the railroads and to
the people. This agitation has now reached
a point where it may be said to carry a threat
to the general welfare of the country; because
it threatens to affect the industrial enterprises
of the country, with the millions of men,
women, and children directly dependent upon
these enterprises. I do not believe that the
people desire the destruction of the railroad
properties; and I believe that the people, the
Government, and the railroads are united in
the desire to turn this current of agitation from
destruction to construction.

The public demands that the railroads of the
United States shall be so regulated by law as to
prevent future injustice in their management
or discrimination in their conduct. The
Government of the United States is shap-
ing its administrative policy to that end.
As a railroad manager and as an individual,
I heartily endorse this policy, and shall do all
I can to promote such a course.

We are not planning and legislating for to-day
alone, but for to-morrow, when there will be
more than 100,000,000 people in the United
States, producing and consuming. "There-
fore the problem of a fair adjustment between
the railroads and the people through the
Government is a problem of greater respon-
sibility than any other problem of the
generation. We must face it with open minds,
laying aside all personal ambition and our
private prejudice to seek first the_good of all
the people, which is also the good of all the
railroads.

I should like to take up in sections the several
points that seem to form the basis, not only
of the popular agitation, but also of most of the
legislation, wise and unwise, now proposed by
the lawmakers of the United States.

I. Elimination o/ the Rebate

The Hepburn Act is effective, and is both
just and wise. As time goes on, the machinery
for the enforcement of the Act will improve,
and should improve, and the enlightened

9149

railroad m," 1.1g 1; will cooperate with the
Governmcn. 21;‚Äù. with the people to enforce the
law. I believe in the principle of the Act,
which is that there shall be uniformity of
charges without illegal discrimination or
unlawful devices to any class of shippers or
communities as against another. I believe
that the rebate is a thfng of the past, as a prin-
ciple, even though in the very nature of things
there will probably never be absolute perfection
in this matter any more than there can be per-
fection in the matter of mail delivery, army
administration, or any other organized adminis-
trative function involving such a large per-
centage of our population.

2. The valuation of Railroads

Valuation for the purpose of establishing
a basis for fixing transportation charges would
not be of any disadvantage to the railroads,
except to further disturb present financial
conditions, but of no practical value for the
purpose of arriving at a fair and equitable basis
for rate-making, and I do not believe that it
would cure the existing ills.

As a railroad manager, I should not
oppose it, nor do I see how the right of the
Government to make such valuation can be
challenged, even though I doubt its ultimate
efficiency in accomplishing the practical results
for which it is being urged. The expense it
would entail on the Government would be un-
wise, as all the elements constituting the prin-
ciple of fair and equitable rates can be had
through other sources of information at the
Government's command-which will be re-
liable while the valuation theory will not.

3. The Limitation of Future Security Issues

This plank in the most radical of all plat-
forms meets my views. I believe that the
capitalization of the railroads should be directly
under Federal law, which would provide
Federal authority to construct and operate a
railroad, the purpose of which is to engage in
interstate traffic either _over its own rails or
through connecting lines. Such legislation
should.be made with the fact clearly in mind
that in some sections of this country there are
large areas that need railroads, and that they
cannot get the railroads unless the builders
are allowed to make a profit, or to see the chance
of profits, on the building. The law should,
however, make it impossible to gain these
profits more than once; and the requirements
