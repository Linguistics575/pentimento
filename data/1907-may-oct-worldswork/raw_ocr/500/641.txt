idol. By aeclamation they canonizcd him,
and he became "Santo" Taft-the patron
saint of the Filipinos. The blunt and jovial
saint reminded oflicc- seeking politicians that

Filipinos there remained America for the
Americans. On the other hand, hc appealed
to his fellow Americans for cooperation, and
by his own conduct set a standard for mutual
toleration.

The Commission journeyed from one reef
of the Archipelago to the other, visiting forty

provinces and possibly a thousand villages.
The local government left behind depended
on the capacity of the native leaders. Partial
autonomy was instituted in thirty-four of the
provinces, even among the Igorrotes. In
some eases this failed, and the province was
ruled direct by the central insular government.
The towns and hamlets were made into popu-
lar-government training schools, where the
petty ofhcial could learn the rudiments and
prepare himself for the exercise of higher
political power.

But almost every province and every town
called for modifications in the general plan.
In the Moro districts, for example, there was

that there were enough Filipinos twice over
who were capable of holding all the offices.
Why not try half of them; if that did not work
well, then try the other shift? To fill a public

ment. But when one of them was asked
to help with the tax laws, he shrugged his
shoulders. That was a subject of mere detail,
he said, and he had never bothered about it.

But the islanders had grievances that were
not political. Of these Judge Taft undertook
to settle the heaviest, the problem of the friars'
lands. The friars were not merely priests;
they had become extortionate tax-gatherers
and political inquisitors. Their presence was
so obnoxious that when Spain's attention was
