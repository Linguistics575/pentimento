cotton- -yarn mills on the Tyg er River as early as
1816. Where the Fingers' ille Milli IS now, James
Finger had a cotton mill then. Dr. James
Bivings had a mill on the Pacolet River. It
was at this mill, although after Dr. Bivings
had left it, that Mr. D. E. Converse got employ-
ment in 1855. That mill was the connecting
link between the manufactures of the old iron
district and of the modern Spartanburg.

Mr. D. A. Tompkins, of Charlotte, N. C.,
prints a little pamphlet of four pictures of High
Shoals, N. C., in 1750, 1800, 1850, and 1900,
which explains what happened to the manu-
factures of the South during the middle of the
eighteenth century. The first picture shows

the undeveloped water power at High Shoals
in 1750, when the surrounding country was
inhabited by Indians.

The second picture-of High Shoals in 1800
---shows a rolling mill in operation, and under-
neath is the following explanation: "Inside So
years there had been developed in the neighbor-
hood a very considerable manufacturing inter-
est. Amongst other industries, there were
numerous blast furnaces making charcoal pig-
iron." The High Shoals works made bars,
nails, plowshares, and other wrought-iron
products. At Lincolnton, in North Carolina,
the first cotton mill south of the Potomac was
built in 1813. A little later, cotton-mill
machinery of good workmanship and design
was manufactured there. At Greensboro, N.
C., a cotton mill run by steam was erected in
1830. At Greensboro also, and near Pendleton,

were made the rifles used along the Southern
frontier. There were eight gunpowder fac-
tories in the state, and paper plants that turned
out 6,000 pounds of paper a year.

The picture of High Shoals in 1850 is typical
of the next epoch in the history of the South.
The roller mills were in ruins. The manu-
facturing interests of this whole section had
decayed and with them had gone free edu-
cation. The invention of the cotton gin had
suddenly made the production of cotton with
slave labor so profitable that it choked the
growing manufactures of the South, ruined its
varied industries, and turned all its energies
toward developing an economic system directly

antagonistic to that of the rest of the world.
What the novelists call the "Old South" was
this period of cotton plantations on the sea-
board and small cotton farms in the Piedmont:
of ruined iron works and struggling cotton
factories-the period of slavery.

The fourth picture shows High Shoals as
it is to-day, with the water power turning the
spindles and looms of a great cotton mill.
Freed from the institution of slavery, when
they recovered from its results, and from war and
Reconstruction, the people of the Piedmont
began to manufacture again as they had done
when they first came to this country.

The smokestacks and a revived education,
the cotton mills and the colleges have again
started the people of the Piedmont as a part
of a great nation to doing their work in the
progress of the world.
