Virtue, honor, loyalty still accomplished deeds
of incredible difficulty, deeds which will stand
to all time as the achievements of purest hero-
ism; but they were the outcome of pride of
virtue, pride of honor, pride of loyalty.

THE RISE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS

In considering Japanese character to-day,
it is necessary to realize that this pride of
race is still one of the strongest materials of
its fibre. In past times it was the inheritance
of the ruler, the noble, and the soldier; these
regarded the classes engaged in trade and labor
(agriculture excepted) as mere useful cattle.
Now, by the emancipation of the lower classes
and their newly acquired rights under a rep-
resentative government, as well as by the
renown achieved in the late war, it has become
with certain modifications the distinguishing
quality of the masses in Japan. In the rush
to the towns for education and employment,
and in the influence spreading out from the
towns to carry modern activities further every
day, a great new element has been created in
Japan, the element of a middle class, with
all the good and bad qualities which the term
implies.

What effect is this new element likely to
have on the national character? A glance at
the history of the middle class in England may
help us to answer that question. Its rise to
prominence has been a quick growth, compris-
ing actually some fifty or sixty years. Before
that there was a commercial class, indeed--
the British merchant and the British banker
were powers in the land. Each was proud
of his calling, staunch in his politics, a well-
educated, well-read, high-thinking man. He
was jealous of his privileges, reluctant to tres-
pass on those of his social superiors, and
abhorred the idea of lowering himself by inter-
course with inferiors. The gulf between the
peer and the merchant was no deeper than that
which lay between the merchant and the
tradesman. The aristocrat governed the Coun-
try, in Parliament and out of it; his younger
sons went forth to fight its battles and annex
new continents; the British Empire is the
work of the well-born cadets for whom there
was no room at home. It was their business
to open the ports of the world to British com-
merce; but, that done, their task was ended
and the steady-going British merchant did the
rest.

All these conditions are changed, and the

change is in great part due to American
influence. The wedding-garment of wealth
admits any churl to society's banquet, and
there is no master of the feast to bid him take
a modest place. There is no longer an upper
class in the true sense of the word; the trades-
man of yesterday can hobnob with royalty
to-day, and his errand-boy may look forward
to the same honor to-morrow. All is muddy
with mediocrity. In its initial state, the middle-
class element is commendably spongy, ab-
sorbing greedily all that touches it, whether
from above or below. When it has reached
the limit of its absorbing capacity, it hardens
and becomes a, concrete mass.

America stands sponsor, more or less dr.
rectly, for the new middle class in Japan. It
consists of millions of men who have too sud-
denly discovered that all human beings are
equal; that obscure birth and lack of fortune
are no real disqualifications in the race of life;
that education is to be had for the asking and
opens the way to all that men desire, whether
ambition or love of gain be their guiding star.
Like the middle class in other countries, they
are quick forgetters of past benefits and in-
ordinate believers in their own powers; and,
in common with their prototypes beyond the
seas, their aims are rather personal than
national, their sensibilities blunt, and their
methods coarse.

HOME EDUCATION FOR THE JAPANESE

The young Japanese of low birth wants one
thing only-the teaching which shall help him
to make money. The ancient pride of race,
just communicated to him by its old safe-
keepers, the aristocrat? quickly degenerate
into conceit and is apt to fill him with inflated
ideas of his own powers. When he contem-
plates the apparent prosperity of other coun-
tries and realizes the tremendous force of
money, and thinks he sees it so easily made
in America, he resents the meagreness of his
own chances. He tells himself that he has
quite as much "smartness" as any foreigner,
and that he lacks nothing for success on the
same lines except fluent English and a little
practice in business methods. He is the man
whom conceit is blinding to-day.

This new eagerness for gain is the result of
the in-rush of American influence combined
with the inevitable swing of the pendulum
which balances all human history. In a class
which in the future must count for much in the
