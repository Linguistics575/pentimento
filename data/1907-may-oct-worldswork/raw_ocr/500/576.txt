their excellent moral character. Not only is
crime distinctly rare among them but they are
extraordinarily quiet, good-natured, and well-
behaved. They are, as a rule, utterly above
petty thieving and may be trusted absolutely
with goods, valuables, or money, while in mat-
ters of business they have a high sense of honor.
The mere word of a Chinese merchant or trad-
ing-house is good for tens of thousands of dol-
lars; your Chinese steward is absolutely straight
in his accounts; your washcrman returns every
garment you sent out and seldom attempts to
overcharge; and housewives have found that
it is perfectly safe to pay the bill presented by
the Chinese market-gardener at the end of the
month (made up from a row of mysterious
scratches with charcoal on the canvas cover of
his wagon) without troubling to check it up.

The Japanese do not bear so high a char-
acter in this regard. The paper of their "mer-
chants is not so good and they are frequently
accused of sharp practice in bargains or con-
tracts--but since when have we been entitled
to hold up hands of holy horror at this sort of
thing? In the fine old Johnsonese phrase,
"the invidiousness of their offense consisteth
not in the singularity of it." Granting all that
. they have been accused of, they are nearly as
honest as the average white man; indeed, much
of the disfavor with which they are begining
to be regarded is due to the fact that they are
coming to meet us, if not to beat us, at our own
game.

Apart from these merely commercial or
mechanical virtues, both Japanese and Chinese
have an excellent personal reputation all up and
down the Coast. Not only are they honest and
industrious, but they are kindly, cheerful,
grateful for good treatment, devoted to the
children of the families in which they work,
faithful to their friends, kind to their families,
to one another, and to everyone in trouble.
They give liberally, not only to their own poor,
but to Christian missions and charities. "As
fat as a Chinamanâ€™s horse" has passed into a
proverb. The dislike of them is racial and
class, not personal. I was in San Francisco at
the time of the earthquake and noted the utter
absence of any personal ill-feeling toward the
Chinese on the part of the other refugees. White
men and Chinese squatted side by side in the
parks, stood in the same bread-line, and jostled
against each other as they toiled up the streets
away from the fire, loaded with bedding and
food, but there was never a word nor a sign of

other than cheery good fellowship and mutual
helpfulness.

The terrors of the "Yellow Peril" exist
chiefly in the imaginations of walking delegates
and Congressmen. "Chinese cheap labor"
has not to date " ruined" any white man, for the
simple reason that it does not compete with him.
It fills a gap which no white man or woman on
the Pacific Coast is willing to fill, except tem-
porarily under stress of circumstance. It is
not a question of wages. The fact of the mat-
ter is that we cannot get, at any price, more
than half the white labor that we need here now
to build and keep in repair our railroads, man
our mines, work our farms, pick our fruit, our
hops, our nuts, grow our vegetables, and do our
household work. A good general servant in
California, for instance, commands from $30 to
$40 a month, with the washing t put out," and
few are to be had at that price.

To speak of "Chinese cheap labor" pro-
vokes a smile on the Coast, for the Chinese
laborer gets at least as high a wage as the white
man of the same class, and usually a little higher
on account of his superior industry, honesty,
and trustworthiness. Chinese workingmen
earn from $2 to $4 a day in the orchards, the
mines, and the canneries, while a fair Chinese
servant gets $40 a month and board, and a good
cook or steward receives from $50 to $100.
One such cook, with a helper, will provide
meals in a lumber or mining camp for forty or
fifty men.

Nor does the great mass of Japanese inter-
fere with any class of white labor. Certain of
them are more enterprising and versatile, how-
ever, and are beginning to enter the lower grades
of skilled manual labor. Hence their unpopu-
larity with the labor unions and the recent
agitation for their exclusion. The chief trouble
with the Japanese is that he is a little too much
like ourselves.

The Oriental influence upon our social or
political life need give little concern, since both
races come here with the fixed intention of
returning to the Orient-the Chinese after he
has made some money, the Japanese after he
has learned some particular thing. They show.
not the slightest desire to intermarry with the
white race, even if this were permitted; they
take no more interest in politics or in any form
of social life outside of their own colonies and
tongs or guilds than so many horses.

As to the nameless Oriental vices and dir.
eases about which we hear so much, I think
