example, rice is a crop of rapidly rising im-
portance. Formerly it was grown mainly in
the lowlands of the Carolinas. In Texas
and in Louisiana, settlers from the older farm-
ing states are now raising rice by irrigation
on higher ground, where they use planting
machinery and imported Japanese seed suited
to the new conditions. Now the quantity
produced and the low cost at which it can be
sold has brought against the Carolina rice
growers a competition which they are unable
to meet, and the Department of Agriculture
is now experimenting on behalf of Carolina

land in the South. Reclamation of the ever-
glades of Florida is an important project which
is already being looked into by the state in
cooperation with the United States Department
of Agriculture. If, as seems probable, it can
be carried through, the result will be to add to
the state 18,000,000 acres of very fertile land
-equal to one-half of the entire state. Portions
of the everglades already drained have pro-
duced phenomenal crops-in one case, for
example, 40 tons of sugar cane to the acre.

A part of the Great Dismal Swamp, in
Virginia, has been converted into good farming

 

 

 

 

COTTON AREAS AND PRODUCTION, 1905

Each dot represents two thousand bales, or 1,000,000 pounds of cotton.

The year's production was 11,345,989

bales, worth $641 ,720,435

with new importations of plants to take the
place of rice on this land.

What the South needs most, however, is not
new discoveries in agricultural science, but the
application of what is already known. Man,
not Nature, has been at fault. But a change
is at hand. Powerful forces are at work.
The Southern States have prescribed the
introduction of agricultural common-school
instruction, and rapid progress is being made
in method.

There are about So million acres of swamp

land by' the drainage which resulted from
digging the Herring canal, and reclamation of
this type of land can be expected to take place
steadily through private enterprise. In the
case of the large swamp bottoms, particularly
in the Mississippi Valley, the engineering
works and problems involved create a field
for public action. Such reclamation work
also profits the general welfare from the stand-
point of sanitation, and aids largely in the
extermination of the mosquito by destroying
the favorite breeding places.
