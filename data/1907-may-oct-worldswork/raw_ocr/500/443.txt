 

PENNSYLVANLUS PALACE OF GRAFT

feet high, four feet wide and eight feet long
measured eighty feet. The per-foot rule was
the solid contents of a box which would just
hold the article of furniture. And everything
was $18.40 a foot. Under the per-pound rule,
Sanderson's bill to the state for chandeliers
and such bronze was $2,049,522.96. A leading
bronze dealer testified that he would have been
glad to get the job for $800,000. A fair charge
would have been $500,000. Sanderson, con-
tractor, paid Sanderson, the Bronze Company,
$550,000 for the capitol bronze, and the com-
pany made its own profit. Under the per-foot
rule, the Pennsylvania Construction Company,
of which Congressman H. Burd Cassel is the
head, drew over $2,croo,ooo for metal filing
cases without any legal contract at all, so far
as can be learned.

Even contracts with a friend to interpret
them were not convenient enough, it seems.
Baccarat glass, from France, was called for;
but Pittsburg glass from Beaver County was
substituted throughout, with no effect on the
price. There was an utter disregard of values
when it came to making out bills.

THE ELECTION OF A NEW TREASURER

But William H. Berry was elected State
Treasurer in November, 1905, and immediately
there was a change in the progress of the work.
A $3,000,000 scheme to enlarge and beautify
the capitol grounds was dropped outright. In
the six months that followed, the retiring
Treasurer paid bills amounting to $3,887, 522.88.
When M r. Berry took charge of the treasury, on
May Ist, furnishings shown by these bills were
all receipted for as delivered and the bills
approved; room after room was filled with
goods; but delivery could not be made fast
enough to answer the contractor's needs, so
he had just sent the bills. Goods kept coming
in for months afterward. Some never came
at all; at least, they have not been found.

The first thing that aroused the public was
the unpacking of the great bronze doors costing
$65,000. It revealed a double row of heads
on each, which the veriest tyro in politics could
recognize as portraits of some of the most active
men under the contracts and men who made
politics a business; many of them had come
under condemnation because of their methods
in securing votes and shaping events. Huston
explained that they were not portraits, but
merely types; but when the doors had been
photographed and the photographs published

9241

in the newspapers, there were few so dull that
they could not see that Huston's "types" were
all of one type--the men who had to do with
the new capitol.

Then came the fall campaign and, to help
the ticket along, Governor Pennypacker began
telling what a magnificent capitol the state had,
and how it was built within the appropriation.
He made no reference to the furnishings; but
the people took his words in their obvious inter-
pretation, and praise of the new capitol and
faithfulness of the commission to its duty were
sung all across the state. Then Treasurer
Berry remarked that there was a huge mass
of graft concealed about the premises some-
where, and that in his judgment it cost nearer
$13,000,000 than $4,000,000. Then the trouble
began. The Governor asserted that the state
had the worth of its money, and arranged with
the railroads to run cheap excursions to Harris-
burg, that all the people might see for them-.
selves that he was right. Berry, on the other
hand, kept pegging away at the books, finding
out what he could for himself and making it
public, and getting no real assistance either
from the other members of the Grounds and
Buildings Commission, the Governor, or the
Auditor-General. His revelations were so as-
tounding that to the mass of the people they
seemed merely campaign lies. Bcrry's eyes
had been first opened when ten men in ten
days laid $90,000 worth of parquetry flooring,
and he was asked to approve the bill therefor.

SOME OF SANDERsoN's BILLS

According to the specifications, chandeliers
and standards and bronze work were to be
made of a composition of 87% copper and 12%
tin. Artisans employed by ii The Pennsylvania
Bronze Company," which was Sanderson under
an alias, testified that the composition was in
fact 90% copper, 3% tin, and 7% spelter.
This is bad enough; but a firm of iron founders
testified that they sold this Sanderson company
3,000 pounds of iron castings, such as are
commonly used to weight the bases of lamp
and standard supports, at four cents a pound.
And lastly the chandeliers have been found to
be short in weight, in one case 300 pounds
short. The total bill was $2,049,522.96. San-
derson (the Pennsylvania Bronze Co.) sold this
stuff to Sanderson (the contractor) for
$605,851.23.

In the Treasurer's private oif1cc, the ceiling
decoration cost. Sanderson $300 but cost. the
