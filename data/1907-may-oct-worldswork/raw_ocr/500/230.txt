yield sufficient dividends on its value with a
business population only five or six deep.

I know of no happier men than those who
regard their homes as the most attractive
places in the world, provided their homes are
attractive, their occupations are prosperous,
and their lives are not narrowed. This opinion
is firmly fixed in the minds of the people of
Montgomery and in the minds of the prosperous
farmers who live in the country round about.
I heard a man boast of abandoning politics to
cultivate alfalfa and, since he has been success-
ful in both pursuits, you are obliged to share
his enthusiasm for his change of occupations.

As in Columbus the foremost citizen of the
town is chairman of the school board, so in
Montgomery a public-spirited man of fortune,
Dr. B. J. Baldwin, has for many years held
this post-with enthusiasm. Such facts give a
cue to the civic character of many Southern men.

You will find men, without looking far or
long, in almost every Southern community
who will give you a personal experience simi-
lar to this, given by Mr. Benjamin Boswith
Smith, an architect in Montgomery, who has
a farm in the country nearby, which he works
himself. Mr. Smith is a native of Kentucky,
a graduate of Princeton College, and a man
who has traveled much and has lived in several
parts of the United States.

"I have resided eight years in Montgomery, locating
here after much travel and mature consideration, not only
on account of exceptional business advantages and out-
look in the city of Montgomery, but on account of the
magnificent farming lands surrounding the city on every

side. My faith was pinned to the prairie land here
because not only could all crops raised on the other lands
be raised here, but it is in my estimation the most wonder-
ful grass land in the world."

Then he goes on to tell how from hay--
Johnson grass, Bermuda grass and alfalfa---
cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, peas, turnips
etc., etc., etc., he made a net profit of $1,860
on his 180 acres and ditched and fenced and
raised hogs to boot; how he expects to make
$4,000 net when he has it all in good order.
And he adds:

"Anything that will grow anywhere else on earth will
yield bountifully here if properly attended to. I consider
the climate the finest, at least in this continent, way ahead
of California.

"I have done the above with incompetent Negro labor.
I will pay a good German or Swede foreman a good salary
and give him perquisites that will make his home ideal if
he will drift this way. Negroes are fine cotton makers if
they will work, but they will not work. They know noth-
ing but cotton. Our soil cries aloud for proper tillage.
It is the finest soil I have ever seen and, briefly, the man
who cannot make more than a competence on 60 to r60
acres is either too lazy to work or a fool. Laziness, lack
of initiation, lack of application, is our curse in agricultural
matters. With energy, application, study, and the love
of the profession of agriculture, I firmly believe the agri-
cultural output of Montgomery County, Ala., will greatly
exceed the output of any section on earth for the same
acreage. We have as fine lands as anywhere in the world
and our growing season extends from March tst to Nov.
rst, eight months. I can raise three crops on any piece
of land I have, barring the raising of cotton.

"Last, but not least, I can always find a ready market
for everything I grow at good Prices.‚Äù

THE SEABOARD SOUTH

T WOULD be an incalculable gain if
men's conceptions of the South-esp'
cially of the lowland South-could now be
made anew and made directly from facts and
not from traditions or old memories. The
tourist sees post-card pictures of old "mam-
mies" (the "mammy" is practically a defunct
institution), of an old Negro manin rags driving
an ox, of a little grinning Sambo eating a water-
melon, of a former slave cabin, and the like.
The railroads run, of course, along the barrenest
ridges of land, for good engineering reasons;
and the tourist hotels keep the grotesque things
in sight. The literature about Southern life
that has made the deepest impression is either

the literature of the era of slavery, or of the
era of war, or the romances which have to do
with these periods; and the people of the best-
known books about the South are either the
heroes of aristocratic origin, or the poor devils
whose origin was unknown. Some of the
Southern folk themselves, too, think of the land
and of themselves, and of other folk, less by
fact than by traditions, most of which are ex-
aggerated and some of which are altogether
untrue.

The effect of these ludicrous misconceptions
is a real hindrance to knowledge and a check to
growth. Most persons, for example, think of
the south-Atlantic coast cities as unhealthful.
