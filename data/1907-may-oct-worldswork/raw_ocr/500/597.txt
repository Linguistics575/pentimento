THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHITE

brought it about that England has no farmers
and that the English trade schools have till
lately been far inferior to the German schools.

But public opinion in the United States has
now passed most of the academic indifference
to the broadening of education to include the
teaching of any useful thing, provided only
it be taught well enough. As for youthful
ideals and ideals of culture in general, we are
learning that they are endangered not by honest
work of any kind, but only by that narrower
view of life which insists rather on the old
formulas of culture than upon its substance.
The man of thorough work-the man who takes
a pride in his work and does it well because
he is proud of it-does more for the solid cul-
ture of the people as well as for their sound
character than any unproductive cultivated
scholar. The main thing is thoroughness,
which is another name for character.

MAPS OF PUBLIC OPINION

AN INTERESTING public-opinion map

of the United States could be made which
should show pretty accurately what might be
called both the geography and the geology of
public thought on most important subjects.
For example, a map of opinion favorable to
the stringent regulation of railroads would
show almost a uniform color outside the large
financial centres, the color deepening in the
Mississippi Valley and in the South, becoming
deepest of all in Texas. So much for the
"geography" of this opinion. Its "geology'
would reveal a lower stratum of industrial
society that favors not mere regulation but
ownership by the Government of public-utility
corporations. Maps of pro-trust or anti-trust
feeling, would be almost identical with the maps
of railroad-regulation feeling.

A tariropinion map would contain more
colors. The general background would indi-
cate a dominant feeling in favor of protection
to a degree. There would, of course, be free-
trade areas, small or large, on every part of it.
But they would not be large contiguous areas.
A wish for free coal would show in New
England, for free lumber elsewhere, for free
sugar elsewhere; and so on. These many

patches of color would all indicate a pretty
general wish for the revision of some of the
schedules.

A map of opinion about immigration would
show a division of feeling in the Pacific States,
the dominant color being anti-Asiatic. A

rapidly spreading wish for immigrants (white,
of course) would appear on the map of the
South. A welcome color, too, would still
prevail over the Middle West.

A map of the Presidentâ€™s popularity would
show enthusiastic approval in all the Northern
and Western States, except the cities where
men of high financial plans live most densely
and in those regions of the West where it has
been necessary to enforce land-laws that were
long disregarded.

A geological opinion-map of the northern-
most New England States, of Pennsylvania,
and of most of the Southern States would show
those ancient strata of political habit which
suggest that formulas and traditions have long
been mistaken there for thought. The forces
which change all our political maps at intervals
are strongest in the Middle West.

Thus the study of political opinion might
be made easy for amateur politicians. Such
maps would be useful, too, to financiers and
to labor-leaders, two classes of men who seem
to flounder worse than others in their studies
of this subject. The place of a man's residence
and his place in industrial life, as a rule, deter-
mine his opinions on current subjects;and what
he thinks, or thinks that he thinks, is generally
what his neighbors and fellows think; and much
such thinking is done by inheritance, by for-
mula, and by the drift of the crowd.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHITE MEN

HE Congressional Commission that spent

the summer in Europe, investigating the
emigration thence to the United States, has
called attention to facts that show this most
interesting conclusion-that there are not
enough white men in the world. Parts of the
United States still welcome all hale and indus-
trious newcomers, but most of the European
governments are lamenting the departure of
their subjects, some are taking vigorous means
to prevent more from leaving, and several are
even trying to turn the tide back toward
Europe.

In the countries that maintain large armies,
objection is made to the departure of men who
would do military service. But there is a
sounder economic reason than this for dis-
couraging emigration. Laborers are becoming
scarce in parts of Europe, especially farm-
laborers. In a word, white men who can and
will work are needed everywhere. Except
the jungles of the great cities, there are few
