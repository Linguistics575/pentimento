9322 RUNNING A RIVER THROUGH A MOUNTAIN

The national Pure Food Law is a fairly
complete enactment. It marks a vast im-
provement over previous conditions. But it
should require all labels to give the date of
manufacture, because age deteriorates quality
in some cases and, in the case of canned goods,
may cause unhealthy acid solution of metals.
The public right to desirable knowledge over-
rides all commercial interest.

Trade-mark or proprietary Jalocls which
do not inform the buyer of the materials should
name the ingredients, if not the proportions.
Such labeling as "compound," "mixture,"
and "fruit," are not fairly explicit, even though
the Government has private information that

the articles are harmless. It would be better
in the long run, for manufacturers to use labels
more explicit than "premium," "standard,"
etc. Let the people know just what they are
buying, and they will pay for what they want
and pay what it is worth. It will of course
take time, but this result will eventually be
achieved.

The ultimate value of the national food law
depends upon the wisdom of the Bureau of
Chemistry, which body must arbitrarily be.
come food gods, determining what is good and
what is bad, We may safely assume that
present problems will be worked out in the
interest of the consumer.

RUNNING A RIVER THROUGH A

THE SIX-MILE GUNNISON TUNNEL IN COLORADO AS AN
EXAMPLE OF THE RECLAMATION WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT

BY
ARTHUR W. PAGE

I I THE great series of works to irrigate the
dry lands of the West, which are in
progress under the provisions of the

Reclamation Act, mark a distinct chapter in
our history. The magnitude of this work is
hardly appreciated outside of governmental
and engineering circles. I send the following
description of the Gunnison tunnel, merely as
one picturesque example of what the Govern-
ment is doing.

In the southwestern part of Colorado the
Gunnison River flows through a steep-walled
caiion. Twenty miles away the Uncompahgre
River runs slowly through a sage-brush desert,
but it is so small a stream that it will irrigate
less than half of its valley. The United States

"Reclamation Service is doing an interesting
piece of work to divert water from the Gunnison
into the Uncompahgre in spite of the fact that
there is a mountain range between them. It
is cutting a six-mile tunnel through the base

of the mountain-a distance of an hour and a

half's walk at a good fast pace-blasting it out

of rock foot by foot.

Two miles and a half in the mountain from
the Uncompahgre side are about fifteen men

with three drills working in the rock. Two
steel pipes, about a foot in diameter, lead from
a shaft to the head of the tunnel, one pumping
in fresh air and the other sucking out foul air.
An electric train hauls out the rock as it is
excavated, down the long wet tunnel lighted
here and there by electric lights. But near
the western portal is the town of Lujane with
its power plant, machine shop, bunkhouses,
mess rooms, hospital, and 350 busy men, from
the engineer to' the cook, for these two are
the most important men in camp. The work
of all these can be expressed only by the
number of feet a day that the men in the head-
ing remove. If something happens so that they
cannot work, the expense goes on unlessened,
nor can the work be hastened by increasing the
number of men, for there is not room for more
to work. On the efficiency of a few day-
laborers the progress of the whole work depends.

Six years ago a topographic survey was made
of the Gunnison region. Mr. A. L. Fellows
went down the lower end of the cation in a
boat and surveyed the river. His boat upset.
Some of his instruments were lost, but he kept
his records and reported that a tunnel was
