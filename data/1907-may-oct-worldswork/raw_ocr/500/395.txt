formed to take over the Copper King mine,
on the coast of Guerrero. Mr. Charles
Schwab, ex-president of United States Steel
Corporation, is reported as having acquired
two silver mines in Chihuahua for $2, 500,000.
A new $350,000 smelter at Guaymas, on the
Gulf of California, has given an impetus to
mining all along the line of the Sonora
Railroad.

And so on, the items could be multiplied.
But the new and especially sensational feature
is copper. For Mexico copper is a new in-
dustry, yet production is going close to
150,000,000 pounds this year, a bound of 25
per cent. over last year. Experts figure on
225,000,000 pounds for next year, or a Str))'-
cent. gain over this year. And yet the industry
has only just begun. In 1901 Mexico was

fifth in copper mining. In 1902 it was third.
The next year found it second, and one year
later its output was one-fifth that of the United
States. As with silver and lead, it now exports
to us more copper than any other country.

But it must not be thought that Mexico is
any less the greatest silver producer. Last
year it sent us $15,000,000 more than it did
the year before. But at the same time, it is
becoming more and more identified with gold
production. In 1904 it mined $15,300,000
worth, which was an increase of $4,000,000
over the year before, and also more than one-
sixth of what we mined ourselves. Last year

it sent us an increase of more than $3,000,000

worth of gold over 19c)S--more than any other
country except Canada.

Where mining starts a country in life, it is
only after long years that any other industry
can predominate. And this is rare indeed
when the mineral deposits seem exhaustless,
as in Mexico. That any other human occu-
pation should rival the digging of precious
metals at the very height of the fever means for
that country the most reliable of promises that
its prosperity will endure. Now Mexico has
never been identified in the popular mind as
a farming country, yet here is this remarkable
prediction, that within a few years its agricul-
tural products will exceed its mineral output
a hundred-fold. It is based on a gradual
