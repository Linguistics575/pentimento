Orleans and worked fora time as a clerk. The
Bradstreet and Dun mercantile agencies assess
the value of his property at $20,000 to $25,000.
His neighbors say that he and his wife are
worth $50,000. W. T. Montgomery-who is
the postmaster, the brother of the founder, and
vice-president of the bank-is a man of in-
dependent means. He owned and conducted
for twelve years a farm of 640 acres near Fargo,
N. D., which he sold at the time of the rise in
Dakota lands at an advance of from $20 to $2 s
per acre over what he paid for it and invested
in other lands in the neighborhood of Winnipeg,
Canada.

Among the directors of the bank are R. M.
McCarthy, who owns 450 acres of land in the
colony and runs a cotton gin. T. C. Jordan
has a bakery and meat market. He started
in the colony as a farmer. He is now said 'to
be worth something like $8,000 or $9,000.
J. Barker is the town marshal. C. R. Stringer
is treasurer of the town. H. A. Godbold,
who came into the settlement as a farmer
about 1895, runs a general store. The bank
and its directors, because they represent and
are so completely identified with the interests
of the town, have come to have the position of
a sort of chamber of commerce, guarding the
credit of the various enterprises and directing
and inspiring the economic and business
development of the colony.

There are some special difficulties in the
financial direction and development of a town
and colony like Mound Bayou. For instance,
it has been the constant aim of the men who
founded the colony to preserve it as a dis-
tinctively Negro enterprise. Separated from,
yet intimately bound up with the commercial
and political interests of the other communities
about it, the problem of preserving this isola-.
tion has often been a perplexing one. A dif-
ficulty arose a few years ago when the Louis-
ville, New Orleans, and Texas Railway was
sold to the Yazoo and Mississippi. Practically
all the lands purchased from the railroad
company had been subject to a lien for deferred
payments. With the change of ownership in
the railroad, a wholesale foreclosure of these
mortgages seemed imminent. Charles Banks
and his associates in the bank managed, how-.
ever, to have the loans renewed and upon terms
by which the mortgages were to bear 6 per
cent. interest instead of 8 per cent.

In time, all of the original purchase money
for these lands was paid, but many of the colon-

OWNED BY NEGROES

ists had borrowed money for improvements.
There was, therefore, a constant danger that
farmers who were not able to discharge the
mortgages when they came due would lose their
holdings. To provide against this, the Mound
Bayou Loan and Investment Company was
formed, with a capital stock of $50,000. W.
T. Montgomery was made president of this
company and Charles Banks secretary and
treasurer. The plan of this company was to
sell stock to the farmers in the community.
The price of shares was fixed at $50, payable
in monthly instalments of one dollar. By
this means, a capital was secured to take over
the mortgages of those members of the com-
munity who were not able to pay the loans as
they fell due, and at the same time provide a
way by which the owners of the land might
accumulate a sum sufficient to pay off the
indebtedness for which the mortgage was issued.
It is expected that the capital accumulated
in this way will eventually be used to assist
settlers coming into the colony to acquire and
pay for lands, and in this way extend the hold-
ings and the influence of the colony.

THE TOWNâ€™s LOCAL GOVERNMENT

Mound Bayou has been from the first, at
least in the minds of the men who founded it,
more than a business enterprise. As a matter
of fact, its most conspicuous success has been
its local government.

The records of the mayor's court show that,
as Delta towns go, Mound Bayou is a remark-
ably quiet and sober place. There have been
but two homicides in twenty years. Both of
these were committed by strangers-men who
drifted into the community in the early days
before the local self-government and the tradi-.
tions of the town had been established. One
of the men killed was Benjamin T. Green, who
was the partner of Isaiah T. Montgomery in
the early days of the town. The man who
committed this crime was afterwards identified
as a fugitive from justice, who was wanted for
some desperate crime committed in the vicinity
of Mobile. The murder was the result of a
trivial altercation in regard to a box of tacks.

During the whole twenty years of the town's
existence, only three persons have been sent to
the circuit court for trial. Two of these were
men convicted of theft. Since the town
obtained its charter in 1898, there have
been, up to February, 1907, but 163 criminal
cases tried in the town. Of these, fifty were
