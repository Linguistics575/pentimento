WHAT FRANCE

they can let the air into their houses far more
freely than we can. The French windows,
opening like double doors, allow the removal of
the whole sash from the window frame, whereas
ours, sliding up and down, leave half the space
constantly closed.

Yet it is when you come to the table that you
find the most significant contrast between
French household ways and those at home.
Not only does France know how to cook, it
knows how to eat. It takes its time, serves
a meal in several courses, never loads its plate
to the discouragement of appetite, and regards
a luncheon or a dinner as a festal occasion,
thereby facilitating digestion and promoting
sociability. Incidentally, things taste better,
brought on so daintily.

On this latter point, however, a single re-
mark is worth insisting upon. The striking
difference between American and F rench
manners is not that the French people are
more polite, but that so many more French
people are polite. A hotel clerk receives you
as an honored guest and personally shows you
to your room. A shop-keeper inquires solicit-
ously for your health. Your laundress's man-
ner is grace and dignity and sweetness combined.
If you go to the great markets at four in the
morning, when unspeakably rough-looking
men and women are getting their wares into
shape for the day and immense loads of beef
and vegetables and fish are being moved through
the jostling throng of market folk, you will
hear only such cries as "Take care, monsieur/ "
or "Please let me pass, madame!" Think
what you would hear in an American crowd
of that grade!

And soon you discover that you can be polite
to servants without spoiling them. For ser-
vice, among the F rench, is recognized as a fine
art. A waiter, for instance, does not blush
for his calling; he does not assert his quality
by abusing you or refuse deference till bullied
into yielding it. He glories in serving you
exquisitely, and the more sweetly you receive
his attentions the more graciously he bestows
them. It never enters his head that service
degrades. How, pray, should one member
of a democratic community think his honor
tarnished by performing kindly offices kindly
for another member of that community and
gaining a just recompense? We talk a lot about
democracy over here, but there is more of real
democracy in a square mile of France than in
a thousand square miles of the United States.

On the other hand, Frenchmen do not stand
in undue awe of their fellows. T hey are less
afraid than we are of "Mrs. Grundy." They
do as they like, regardless who is looking, and
have even courage to show their feelings and
to follow impulse without a qualm. Hence
their incomparable genius for holiday making.
The trouble with our holiday frolics is not lack
of gaiety; it is our terror lest somebody will
see us stand on our heads and think the less
of us. We are not "solemn asses," but we
pretend to be, on the curious theory that to
get mistaken for cold, lifeless, unfeeling clods
will win us admiration! Perhaps the French
go too far in the opposite direction, and yet
a little more disregard for the onlooker would
improve us mightily.

The French have doubtless derived this
charming independence from the life of the
café. When two hundred people sit together
in the open air, chatting, sipping "bocks,"
playing cards, writing letters, smoking, reading
newspapers, or merely idling, they get used to
being watched. At the same time, they learn
a jolly sociability, which is not without its
moral value, since it makes for friendliness
and something very like democracy.

Perhaps you will think I have strayed a
long way from the subject of art when I make
it admit the holiday and the café, but really
these and the other aspects of French life we
have been speaking of show how persistently
the French require that whatever they set
their hands to shall have the touch of thought-
fulness, taste, and perfect adjustment to human
needs, of whatever degree or whatever sort.
They have made life itself an art-yes, a fine
art.

And as for the arts distinctively "fine,"
who, think you, presides over their affairs?
A Cabinet Officer. No less a dignitary gov-
erns the great museums, the opera, the conser-
vatory of music, and the drama, the preserva-
tion of public monuments, and the restoration
of palaces, cathedrals, and castles. It is just
as Consul-General Mason said: artistic taste
has been fostered by governmental influence
until it has become a national attribute.
Technical schools leave their stamp of elegance
upon French manufactures. Works of art,
acquired by the state, fill galleries to over-
flowing and adorn parks frequented by the
very working people. Minor cities have their
treasure houses of beauty. Everywhere ex-
tends the influence that makes the Frenchman
