"Spencer Minor, at Burdette, Mississippi, produced
five bales of cotton on eighteen acres of land in 1905. In
1906. on exactly the same land, he produced fifteen bales
of cotton, while his neighbors produced only half of this
amount on the same area. He has increased his yield
200 per cent. by adopting our method of culture."

"At Hollandale, Mississippi, Mr. J. E. Brown pro-
duced 100 bales of cotton on eighty acres of land, while
many of his neighbors were producing only one-third as
much cotton on the same class of land adjoining Mr.
Brown's farm."

The following comparative shipments of
cotton along the lines of the Houston and
Texas Central Railroad in Texas, from 1903
to 1905, show the results of work there:

These reports show, no doubt, a somewhat
larger increase of yield than the average; for the
increase depends on the energy and the intel-
ligence and the teachability of the farmer. The
variations in these tables are due chiefly to the
difference between the men who worked these
farms. Still, the instances quoted can be dupli-
cated in everylarge area where the work has
been carried on.

An indefinite number of such instances are
on record in Dr. Knapp's ofhce.

The problem of increasing the product, and
hence the income, of every acre is the same

everywhere-to teach the farmer to bring to
his labor the degree of skill that the skilful
artisan brings to his, or, for that matter, the
skilful artist or the skilful captain of industry.
This method of teaching the man who is him-
self doing the work in the fields, is, therefore,
applicable anywhere-in the North, or in the
Northwest, or in the East. If there be a
difference in the need, it is a difference only of
degree. It looks, therefore, as if we were at
the beginning of a real revolution in the prac-
tical application of productive knowledge to
the common every-day farm, over wide areas
of staple crops. It is simply impossible to
calculate the value of such a system of instruc-
tion.

with exaggeration, but I heard him make this
declaration (in substance) in Richmond, Va.:

"I am, of course, not in favor of war or of conquest.
But if we were bent on acquiring other countries, there
would be an easier way to accomplish it than by conquest.
If every acre of land now under cultivation were cultivated
right-in other words, if we could teach the farmers who
are now tilling the soil how to till it well-we should soon
be able to buy any country that we might take a fancy to---
king, army, navy, and all."

This playful, yet earnest, method of measur-
ing the value of this method of teaching reminds
me of a remark made by an officer of the Far-
mers' Union in Texas. I asked him, "If the
farmers of Texas have five more years as pros-
perous as the last five have been, how rich will
they be N' He thought a moment and said
deliberately: "There ain't that much money!”
