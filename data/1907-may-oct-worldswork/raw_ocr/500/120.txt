I introduced a number of new things during
the year. The first was a Thanksgiving
Day celebration; later on a Christmas-tree.
Few of them had ever seen a Christmas-
tree before. We must have had 2,000
people at one of the large churches and the
grown people as well as the children got a
better idea of how Christmas should be cele-
brated.

The year was a busy one but I had found time
for reading and study, so the superintendent
of schools for Prince Edward County, whose
law office was in Farmville, gave me lessons
in law and loaned me such of his books as I
needed. He would not accept any pay but
often allowed me to work in his office on
Saturdays copying deeds, contracts, etc., which
saved time for him and was splendid practice
for me. I had always had a feeling that I
should like to study law. This enabled me to
occupy my evenings in a systematic and definite
way.

Cumberland County seemed to me just
the place for a small school on the Hamp-
ton plan, so I got some of the more substantial
colored men together and we went over a
scheme for such a school. I wrote to some of
my teachers at Hampton, setting forth our
plans. They advised me not to do it but to
return to Hampton and complete my course.
They felt that I did not have sufficient education
to undertake such a work. Thus I was led
to give up the scheme. My school term was
only five months, but I induced the parents to
lengthen the term a month and a half and we
succeeded in raising sufficient money to con-
tinue our school with the two teachers for that
time.

It was very difficult to leave that community.
The colored people, who were assured of the
assistance of the whites, offered to double my
salary the next year if I would come back, and
I was told by the county superintendent that
I might have a school in his county as long as
he was in office. He visited my school a num-
ber of times during the year, as did also other
members of the district board. He used to
hold it up as a model to the other colored
teachers and to some of the white as well, and
several of the white teachers came to see our
work. We taught the boys to drill and the
girls to take gymnastic exercises and they all
sang under my leading the plantation songs,
which they learned to love and appreciate even

in school. We gave Friday-evening talks to
the parents and older children on habits and
manners and many other things that seemed
to us needful.

That summer I found work in Philadelphia
in John Wanamaker's store, where I came
indirectly under the influence of Mr. Robert
C. Ogden, whose office, among other things,
it was my duty to clean.

I returned to Hampton in October, 1889,
and entered upon the Senior year. This was
in some ways my most interesting year. Some
seventy pupils had been promoted but only
forty-eight returned. I had served as a cap-
tain in the battalion during my Middle year;
now I was senior captain and also assisted Mr.
C W . Freeland, who was then commandant
of the school cadets.

When I entered Hampton, I had no par-
ticular plan or notion as to what I should do
when I should have completed the course.
As time went on, I was more and more inclined
to the legal profession. Most of my teachers
advised against it, however; that is, they
raised the question whether I thought I could
render my people the greatest service as a
lawyer, and whether legal advice was the
greatest need of an ignorant, struggling people.
During the last half of the year, General Arm-
strong taught the Senior class in the Outline
Study of Man. I have scant recollection what
I learned from the ttrt-book, but I doubt if
there is a member of that class to-day who does
not feel the power and influence of General
Armstrong's strong, earnest, forceful per-
sonality. Before many months most of the
class-Indians as well as Negroes-had deter-
mined that they would engage in some work
that would definitely help their races.'

One Saturday night in the early spring,
General Armstrong invited the Senior boys
to his house, where he told us some interesting
war experiences with Negro soldiers. When
we rose to leave, he asked me to remain. He
took me into his study and questioned me as
to my plans for the future. I told him of my
industrial school scheme for Cumberland
County and my desire to help those people.
He thought I could be of more use to my people
by remaining at Hampton and helping to
prepare teachers. The result was that at the
close of school in June, 1890, I accepted the
position of drill-master and assistant to the
commandant of the school cadets.
