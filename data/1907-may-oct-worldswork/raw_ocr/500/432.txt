lawyer to the bench where his father had sat
twenty years before. Since then the son has
followed this eminent father higher and higher
up, as Solicitor-General, as Secretary of War,
and lastly, as a Presidential possibility; until
now, at only fifty years of age, he has passed
his father, and is a "probability."

As a judge, Taft began to show that mar-
velous capacity for clear thinking which he
had been achieving by such hard work. He
hated the trickery, the juggling of technical-
ities, the playing for delays, that befuddled an
issue. Unerringly he went straight to the kernel
of justice.

Then election day drew near. His unex-
pired term lasted but a year, and to continue
there, he must go before the people. But first
he was at the mercy of the nominating con-
vention; and, as usual, the convention was at
the mercy of the machine. Men loyal to the
machine thought they should have the job
held by the machine's implacable foe. The
young leader, Cox, looked at the matter in the
same way. But Cox and Foraker happened
to be working together just then, and a whisper
floated from the executive mansion: "Support
Taft." But there was no deal with Taft.
Foraker was a better public servant as Governor
than he has been since. And, moreover, Taft's
name on the ticket would help it. So Cox
did support Taft, in this, the only time when
he has ever been a candidate for office. And
Taft was nominated, and was elected. Five
thousand was a comfortable, and even gratifyin g
majority.

He now had a term of five years before
him, but he served only two years. President
Harrison wanted him for the service of the
Nation, and in 1890 Judge Taft resigned, and
went to Washington as Solicitor-General of

the United States. In the routine press
mention of his appointment at the time, it was
stated that he had not been an applicant. This

was strictly true, even though there were a
$7,000 salary attached. In this particular case
the office had sought the man.

SOLICITOR-GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

The appointment came on the last day of the
year, and a fortnight later he had on his hands
the defense of the Government in a contro-
versy that had fretted the peoples of three
countries for fourteen years past. This was
the old, wearisome question of the seal fisheries.
It had flamed to a critical point, now. Our

revenue cutters in Bering Sea had captured a
Canadian schooner, the Sayward, fifty-nine
miles from land, and the Federal District
Court in Alaska had condemned it to be sold.
The owner demanded damages. The Cana-
dian Government thought he should have
them, and Great Britain thought the same.
The Premier, Salisbury, vigorous: took the
matter up with Blaine, our Secretary of State.
But we rejected the Sayward claim, whereupon
the other side proposed arbitration. We were
considering this, when Great Britain startled
us by bringing the case before our own Supreme
Court.

This was done indirectly, by giving sanction
to the Saywardâ€™s owner and the Canadian
Minister of Justice in an application for a writ
prohibiting the forfeiture proceedings against
the libelled vessel. Here was a most novel
suit, because of the parties thereto. Blaine,
however, did not relish the alleged compliment
to our courts. A decision against us would
put us in the wrong in a controversy with
another nation. But the other nation declined
to be bound by a decision the other way. Still,
in this embarrassing muddle so craftily engi-
neered, it was very important that we should
win the Supreme Court case. Pending the
suit, more than one hundred vessels, nearly
all Canadian, were equipping for a crusade on
the seals. During one closed season, they
would literally destroy the rich industry.

Thus the case stood when the new Solicitor-
General took hold. Opposing him was Cal-
deron Carlisle, Jr., and later, Joseph H.
Choate. But he plunged into the devious
tangle, and came forth with a brief 300 pages
long, clearly, patiently, and effectively sus-
taining his country. It revealed a staggering
amount of research. And he won the case.

Quickly following on the heels of this labor,
there had to be defended another suit of vast
importance. This grew out of Speaker Reed's
blithesome arithmetic in counting a quorum.
A firm of importers, being made to pay the
new high duties, tried to knock out the whole
McKinley tariff on the contention that the bill
had not been passed by a constitutional quorum.
They had won their case already in the Circuit
Court, but the Government had appealed to
the Supreme Court. Here its counsel (Taft)
fell back on the record of the House's pro-
ceedings. Speaker Reed had announced from
the Clerk's list 74 members present at roll-.
call who had not voted. These, with the I 38
