(the march of Events

ITH the national conventions less

R; ii) than a year away, the political talk,

such as there is, is not of parties but of
men, and not of policies about which the parties
differ but chiefly of the one policy about which
they formally agree-thc national regulation
of corporations.

This " issue" has overshadowed every other.
In a general way, Mr. Roosevelt, Secretary
Taft, Governor Hughes and Mr. Bryan are at
one on this subject. Hence either Secretary
Taft or Mr. Hughes would defeat Mr. Bryan
because either of them would satisfy the tie
mand for the regulation of corporate power,
and would at the same time be more acceptable
to the great business and financial interests
than Mr. Bryan. On the other hand, Mr.
Bryan would stand a good chance to defeat
Mr. Fairbanks or Senator Knox or any other
Republican candidate who is associated in the
public mind with "friendliness" to Corpora-
tions-all thS, of course, on the very reason-
able supposition that the public will next year
be in a mood similar to its present mood. The
policy of the national regulation of corpora-
tions is the winning policy. Parties count for
little, and men count for much or little except
in their attitude to this subject and to the
subsidiary subjects.

The Republican party will hardly dare to
nominate any man who is not convincingly
committed to this policy, for fear of Mr. Bryan;
and the Democrats will hardly dare to nominate
any man but Mr. Bryan because .the long
apathy of the party has not permitted the
development of any other man as a "possi-
bility." Apparently it must accept him as

the only candidate on the party horizon-in
fact as almost the only Democrat of Presi-
dential size whom the whole country knows.

It is an odd situation, brought about chic0y
by the dominant personalities of Mr. Roosevelt
and Mr. Bryan, one of whom cannot be a
candidate and the other cannot be elected.
But, strangely enough, the influence of them
both will probably unite to make either Secre-
tary Taft or Governor Hughes the next Presi-
dent-more likely Secretary Taft.

T here arc, thus, only three active forces in
national politics now-Mr. Roosevelt, Mr.
Bryan, and the regulative policy upon which
for all practical purposes they are agreed.
The political parties, as parties, are dormant
masses upon which these active influences may
work. Mr. Bryan has for the time being
killed the Democratic party, as a party, and
Mr. Roosevelt has so given the Republican
party a new direction of activity that his policies
dominate it.

PARTIES AND PRESENT LEADERS

()OKED at from a philosophical point

of view, this anomalous political situation
is not necessarily discouraging. On the con-
trary, it probably means that we are near
to a time when the parties, as parties, will
again have to give clearer and better
accounts of themselves and show better reasons.
for existence.

It is interesting to recall how we came into
this peculiarly personal era of political history.
As late as Mr. Cleveland’s second Administra-
tion the parties, as parties as. large masses
of men, independently of the personality of
