ARMY LIFE AND DISCIPLINE

the tropics and in the summer season in the
United States is not a thing of beauty, but it is
comfortable and is suited for field service in
hot weather, which is what it is intended for,
and it will wash. This uniform, and in fact
any other, is sloppy in appearance when the
blouse is worn unbuttoned, as the men seem
to have a perfect mania for doing as soon as
they get from under the eyes of their officers.

TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY WORK

Mr. Forbes, however, makes some good
points. In the matter of overworking the men,
I feel that he is to a certain extent right. There
is too much of the everlasting grind of drill
and practice marches, and at some posts too
much "fatigue" in the way of keeping the
reservations in apple-pie order. It is pretty
much of a shock to many men who have entered
the service to taste the delights of military life
to find that, from the standpoint of their post
commanders, the most important part of their
training consists in cutting brush and weeds.

As to practice marches, a certain amount of
them are necessary to teach the men how to
march and carry their packs, but it is very
easily overdone. Practice marches should be
held only when the roads are good and the
weather neither too hot nor too cold. The
theory that in peace men should make marches
in rain and snow and in hot weather, merely
because they would have to do so in a cam-
paign, is in my mind merely rubbish. Men
expect to undergo all sorts of hardships in war
and are willing to, but nothing makes them
curse and damn the service like a peace-time
practice march in snow or mud, merely to
carry out somebody's theories about hard-
ening them. To work out this theory fully,
we should line the soldiers up and shoot at
them once a, week to get them used to the sound
of bullets. Practice marches are all right and
necessary, but within limitations.

WORKING HOURS TOO LONG

I further agree with Mr. Forbes that reveille
is too early at all posts; 6:30 is early enough
for men to get up from March until September,
and 7:30 during the balance of the year. The
day is long enough to get all necessary work
out of them if they rise at those hours. Re-
treat formation and roll-call is an old institu-
tion, and to the Army it would seem like sacri-
lege to do away with it. It serves no really
useful purpose other than that of keeping

track of the men. The abolition of this roll-
call, allowing the men not on guard to spend
their time as they see fit from the conclusion
of drill until call to quarters, would undoubt
edly add greatly to the contentment of the
men; but the privilege would be abused by a
certain element among the soldiers. These
latter could, however, be weeded out of the
army if the service was made so attractive that
there would be no difficulty in obtaining all
the recruits desired.

The question of the attitude of many of the
young officers toward the enlisted men is one
very difficult to express an opinion upon, for
the reason that those officers who cannot speak
to an enlisted man except in an insulting tone
of voice are pretty careful not to offend thus
in the presence of their superiors. I fear there
is too much truth in Mr. Forbes's complaints
on this score, but the offenders are nearly all
officers very recently commissioned. As they
grow older, they realize that shoulder-straps
do not make a man, and also become more
sympathetic and tolerant.

I do not know that the officers coming from
the Military Academy are any worse in this
respect than those from the ranks or from civil
life, and doubt if they are. Shoulder-straps
seem to hurt most very young men when they
first get them on, unless they have good mental
balance. The remedy for abuses of this kind
lies in eternal vigilance on the part of regi-
mental, post, and company commanders.

THE CANTEEN QUESTION

I feel some hesitaney about mentioning the
canteen for the reason that every army officer
who expresses an opinion favorable to that
institution is promptly spitted and boiled in
oil, figuratively speaking, by the intolerant
bigots who drove Congress into that piece of ill-
advised legislation. The sale of beer in the can-
teen would add greatly to the contentment of
the great majority of the men. It might,
however, start a few ycung men to drinking
before they otherwise would, which would of
course, be regrettable. The gymnasium and
amusement rooms for which Congress ap-
propriated so liberally have not attracted the
men and are largely failures. When a man
comes in hot and dusty after a drill or practice
march, he wants a drink of beer and is going to
have it somewhere or other. He does not want
to be steered up against a pair of dumb-bells
or an encyclopedia.
