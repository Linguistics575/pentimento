Most of the activities of to-day in the world
of medicine and its wide-spreading allies are
along the lines of control of the destructive
ferments. Bacterial infections act chiefly
through the poisonous ferments secreted by
the germs in the blood. Internal disarrange-
ments of stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney,
thyroid, suprarenals, loss of arterial elasticity,
are all instituted by the loss of balance between
the constructive and destructive ferments; and
investigators aim at discovering the exact
chemical nature of these ferments, and the
discovery of their antidotes. Medicine has
yet far to go to not only successfully cope with
the giant ferments that make such short shrift

in destroying us; but to penetrate the still
deeper, more delicate, and difficult class of
ferments which work destruction to all alike in
the course of time---the glandular ferments.
But it seems almost certain that the next fifty
years will see far more amazing advance than
even the past half-century has shown, in which
over 90 per cent. of present day medical skill
has been attained; and equally certain, that no
one great discovery will throw open the portals
of this great realm of mysteries, either in cause
or cure. Many' angles and facets, shadows
and high-lights must be thrown on the screen
of life's mysteries, to evolve an intelligent
picture. We can only say that physical im-.
mortality, within the range of planetary life,
does not seem innately impossible.

A NEW RELIEF TO CITY TRAFFIC

THE SUCCESS oy MOTOR CABS AND 'BUSES IN LONDON AND PARIS

BY

of a great city by the use of motor

omnibuses. Last year 800 of these
'buses, operated by 25 companies, carried
184,000,000 passengers-Foot:) a day-for
an average fare of a little more than a cent a
mile. The street railways of London carried
4,000,000 fewer passengers during the same
period, and the best record of the New York
subway is only about 540,000 passengers
carried in one day. And this new and simple
device for relieving traffic has earned from 7
to IO per cent. a year on an investment of
$5,000,000.

No American city has such a system, but
the facts that follow seem to show that the
example of London and Paris could be followed
by New York and Chicago, and other con-
gested cities, to the great convenience and com-
fort of the public and to the profit of the pro-
moters.

The advantages of the system arc being
increasingly appreciated. The owners have
no heavy investment to make in rails or trol-
leys. The public convenience is better served,
because the routes of the 'buses may be altered
in an emergency to go around a blocked street,

I ONDON is solving the transit problem

or to meet the exceptional demand for transit
over new routes on holidays. Ordinarily, these
'buses run over regular routes on schedules
that in some cases assure a passenger that he
will not have to wait more than ten minutes
for a 'bus at any time of the day. And the
city traffic problem is simplified by the fact that
the motor 'buses occupy less space and carry
more passengers than 'buses drawn by horses.

These new 'buses are double-decked; each
has seats for thirty-four passengers, or ten
more than the horse 'buses accommodate.
Most of the passengers prefer to sit on the upper
deck, to which they ascend by means of a
curved stairway from the rear platform. The
wheels are rubber-tired, noiseless, and easy.
The engines, generating from 24 to 40 horse-
power, are run by gasoline, all except a very
few that use steam. The 'buses cover their
eight routes at an average speed of twelve
miles an hour, making an average daily run
of from 90 to 120 miles a day. The relative
seating capacity of the motor 'buses and of the
horse-drawn 'buses, considered with the greater
distance traveled by the motor 'bus, indicates
that one motor displaces from twelve to sixteen
horses a day, reckoning eleven horses to one
