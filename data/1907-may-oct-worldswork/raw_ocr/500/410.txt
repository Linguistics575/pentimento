side of another ridge, because the south side
is rock while the north side is loam. He may
narrow the choice of mountain passes to two or
three. Occasionally, he will select the pass,
as General Dodge selected the Sherman Pass
by which the railroad crosses the Black Hills.

THE FIRST SURVEY AND THE "LOCATION"

When the reports of all the reconnaisances
are digested, the preliminary survey begins.
This is usually in detail, but it is not quite
final. In the case of the new Tidewater
Railroad, in Virginia, these surveys left a choice
on some divisions between as many as twelve
routes to be decided by the chief engineers and
the directors. Each alternative route, however,
is fully detailed. For instance, if the survey
shows a cut through a hill, it is supposed to
show also whether the cut is through rock,
sand, clay, shale, loam, or any other substance.
Grades are carefully figured, as also curvature,
bridges, fills, and cuts.

The next step is the location of the line.
This is decided from the surveys. The report
of the location must be in the fullest detail, every
hollow, every rock, every river being minutely
examined and measured. The letting of the
contracts for construction is based upon this
location. If an engineer errs by so much as
reporting a ledge of shale in the side of a hill
instead of a ledge of granite, this mistake
throws out the estimate of "first cost" by just
so much. On a single mile of road, that one
mistake may make a difference of nearly
$10,000 in the cost of construction.

So much for the routine by which the placing
of a new line is accomplished. It is very sim-
ple, of course. If there is one thing that stands
out from it quite clearly, it is that the effective-
ness of this routine and the perfection of the
work accomplished through it depend directly
upon the men who put it into execution. That
points to the civil engineer.

The cream of this profession rises thin. It
is a strange and interesting fact that nearly all
the great railroads through the Rocky Moun-
tains were surveyed and carried through by the
same men. Of course, each system had some
new men, but the backbone of the staff in each
instance seems to have been composed of the
engineers who ran the Union Pacific and the Cen-
tral Pacific to a junction at Promontory, Utah, in
1869. They met again at Sierra Blanca when
Mr. Gould's Texas Pacific joined Mr. Hunt..
ington's Southern Pacific, and yet again on

the Santa Fé, the Northern Pacific and the
Canadian Pacific when the rails from the West
met the rails from the East. T 0-day, most of
these veterans are gone, but here and there one
may be found holding an honorable post.
For instance, Mr. Robert Bliekensderfer, con-
sulting engineer of the Wheeling & Lake Erie
at Pittsburg, helped to build the Santa Fé, the
Missouri Pacific, the St. Louis & San Fran-
cisco, and the Union Pacific. General Dodge
was a factor in building the Union Pacific, the
Texas Pacific, the Fort Worth & Denver City,
and the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railroads.

SOME DANCERS OF A RECONNAISSANCE

Let us start with the first reconnaissance of
the first transcontinental line, the Union Pacific.
It was headed by Peter A. Dey, with Grenville
M. Dodge as first assistant. They crossed the
Missouri River at the point where Omaha now
stands, and General Dodge will not commit
himself as to whether they used a raft or a
flat-boat. In any case, it was no palatial ferry.
They struck out into a howling wild. One
incident will serve very well to illustrate the
nature of the expedition and the country. It
is told by the General himself in a speech that
he made in 1888, a copy of which he gave to
the writer for use in this connection:

"When I crossed my party over to make the first ex-
plorations, not one of us had any knowledge of the Indians,
of the language, or of plainscraft. The Indians surrounded
our wagons, took what they wanted, and dubbed us
'squaws.' In my exploring, ahead and alone, I struck the
Elkhorn River about noon. Being tired, I hid my rifle,
saddle, and blanket, sauntered out into a secluded place
in the woods with my pony, and lay down to sleep. I was
awakened and found my pony gone. I looked out into
the valley and saw an Indian running off with him. I
was twenty-five miles from my party, and was terrified,
It was my first experience, for I was very young. What
possessed me I do not know, but I grabbed my rifle and
started after the Indian, hollowing at the top of my voice.
The pony held back, and the Indian, seeing me gaining
upon him, let the horse go and put the Elkhorn between
us. The Indian was a Pawnee. He served under me in
1865, and said to me that I made so much noise he wa'
'heap scared.' "

For eight years they carried on that survey,
learning as they went much about these Indians.
They followed the trail of the fur-seekers, broken
wide by the Mormons in their long pilgrim-
age. When the settlers' movement to California
began, General Dodge made a map to guide the
feet of the emigrants. It took the trail from
