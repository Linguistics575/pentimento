A SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE

and the dock region, is one of the most

dismal labyrinths of mean streets to be
seen in the whole of the metropolis. Nearing
Tidal Basin, however, forests of masts begin
to rise above the roofs, and here and there is
a practical reminder that this is the haunt of
sailors. Here is located the London School of
Tropical Medicine.

This medical college is attached to a branch
hospital belonging to the Seamen's Hospital
Society, which had its first home on board the
old 5o-ton Grampus in the Thames. Seamen
in general, and Lascars, Negroes, and Chinese
in particular, object to being taken, when ill,
far from their own ship ; and in the cheerful hos-
pital wards are seamen of many nations.
Among the strange complaints treated in these
wards during the last ten years are plague,
leprosy, malaria, beri-beri, trypanosomiasis,
numerous cases of guinea-worm, etc., the 11n-
checked spread of any one of which in the port
of London would have involved a serious
money loss, to say nothing of the loss of life.
During its eighty-five years' work, the Society
can show a wonderful record of beneficent
work on behalf of tt Jack Tars" from all over
the world.

All the students are physicians, menand women
wishing to gain special knowledge of the dis-
eases with which they will have to deal in the
tropical countries to which they expect to go.
The popularity of the school is proved by the
fact that the accommodation has twice been
increased during the seven years that have
elapsed since it was opened. Over 660 students
have been enrolled, many of whose names are
well known for subsequent good work in differ-
ent quarters of the globe. Of these, 303 were
in the service of the British tropical colonies
and other British service, 35 in that of foreign
governments, 80 were medical missionaries,
while the remainder were employed by private
firms, or engaged in practice on their own
account, mainly in the tropics. The course

BETWEEN Liverpool Street, London,

of study, originally fixed at three months, has
been extended to four, and a more prolonged
course may be arranged shortly.

It is hardly necessary to remark that the
lecturers are specialists in their various depart-
ments. All branches of science bearing on
tropical diseases are dealt with and demon-
strations are given in the museum and post-
mortem room as opportunity occurs. The
teaching staff includes Sir Patrick Manson,
well known for his work in connection with the
mosquito-malaria theory. Sir Francis Lovell
is clean.

Ten years ago, tropical medicine had but
a small place in the ordinary medical curricu-
lum, while the enormous mortality among
government ofncials, business employees, and
missionaries was one of the chief hindrances to
commercial and social development in the
tropics. To-day, as the direct result of ad-
vanced knowledge, not only is it known that
many diseases which gained for some regions
the title of tt the white man's grave" are prevent-
able, but vigorous measures are being taken to
exterminate them. Medicalinvestigators work-
ing in isolation hailed with joy the opportun-
ities afforded by Sir Patrick Manson, who
gathered together all the physicians he could
collect and demonstrated to them some of the
recent discoveries. At the same time, a series
of lectures given at Charing Cross Hospital
attracted the attention of Mr. Joseph Chamber-.
lain, then Colonial Secretary, and at his invi-
tation the Seamen's Hospital Society opened
a small laboratory for eighteen students.

Almost simultaneously, a similar movement
was set on foot at Liverpool, and since that
time laboratories have been established in
Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kwala Lum-
pur, the Federated Malay States, Entebbe,
Uganda, British Guiana, and Khartum.

Perhaps the most interesting expedition
carried out was that conducted by Drs. Low
and Sambon, following on Ross's proof of the
mode of transmission of malaria. These two
