with studied politeness, it views the present
critical position with perfect coolness and
indifference.

result?

SCHOOL-CH I LDREN IN LOCK-STEP

ALL TREATED ALIKE, THE BRIGHT AND THE IDULL-HOW THOUSANDS OF
YEARS OF INDIVIDUAL WORK ARE WASTED--THE EASY AND NATURAL REMEDY

BY

WILLIAM J. SHEARER

SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, ELIZABETH, N. J.

ORE than fifteen years ago I made
?i/ilf diligent but unsuccessful search for a
plan of organization which would
make it possible for pupils to advance in grade
as they were able, in place of being hurried or
held back by others. This search revealed the
fact that the plan universally used was defended
by none, and almost unanimously condemned,
not only by parents and teachers, but even by
boards of education and superintendents who
were responsible for the method.

This method requires all children to move
at the same pace, regardless of a hundred
differing factors which influence their pro-
gress. The teachers have been compelled to
waste their energy in striving to stretch those
mentally "short" and compress those who are
mentally "long," that all may appear equal to
the mythical average pupil. A system which
would not be tolerated for the physical develop-
ment of children is no better for their mental
development. The decree of uniformity is:
"In together, all together, on together, out
together"-if there are any left with sufficient
intellectual life to get to the top of the mental
tread-mill.

A COMPARISON OF PLANS

Having failed to find a satisfactory plan, I
worked out one which produced results entirely
different. These results were secured by
making it easily possible to keep pupils of about
ty lal advancement together at all times, that
t1 e work might be accurately suited to the
needs and capacities of all. This much desired

end was reached by the abolition of the pro-
motion examination, and by allowing pupils
to advance at any time by a number of short
steps rather than once a year by a long jump.

By the usual plan, a pupil who falls a month
behind drags along until the end of the term,
fails to be promoted, and loses a year. Thus
thousands of years are lost unnecessarily.
Why should a pupil lose a year when but a
month or so behind his class? By the flexible
plan of grading, which many have adopted, a
pupil, who for any reason falls a month behind,
drops back that distance, which may easily be
made up if he has the ability and the disposition
to do so. For this reason, pupils lose only the
time they should lose.

Under the old plan, pupils are moved to
advance work at the time arbitrarily fixed,
when it is hoped even the slower ones may be
ready. Is it any wonder that 85 per cent.
lose time under such a plan? Need we be sur-
prised that the records prove that few, if any,
finish the course in less than eight years, and
that the large majority of those who have not
become discourag,ed take almost ten years
to do the work? Why should we be surprised
that 80 per cent. of the pupils in the public
schools of the United States are found in the
four lowest years of a twelve-year course?
Under the new plan, pupils take up advance
work when they are ready for it. By so doing,
80 per cent. below the high school save time.
Seventy-five per cent. of those who completed
the grammar course in Elizabeth, N. J., last
year did so in less than eight years. Twelve
