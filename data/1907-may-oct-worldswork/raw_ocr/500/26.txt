of which we are just beginning to understand)
each almost approach it.

Many millions will be called for by this vast
system of internal improvement, both from
local sources and the Federal Government.
There have been more than So millions of
dollars appropriated by Congress for Missis-
sippi River improvements alone during the last
twenty- five years. One subject successfully
carried out will suggest another-in river-work
and in canal work; and the task, after we
seriously begin it, will extend over many years
and will dwarf the Panama Canal both in cost
and time; but it may fairly be called the next
great step in the subduing of our rich territory.
A complete system of waterway improvements,
such as this Commission has an opportunity
to formulate in outline, will make our great
Central and Southern States capable of main-
taining a population several times as great as
they now contain, with a higher degree of health
and productivity and convenience than we now
have. It will work the beginning of a really
intensive and scientific culture of the soil as
distinguished from the era of the pioneer, out
of which we have yet hardly passed.

The Inland Waterways Commission consists
of Representative Theodore E. Burton, of
Ohio; Senators Francis G.Newlands of Nev-
ada and William Warner of Missouri; ex-
Representative John H. Bankhead of Alabama;
Gen. Alexander Mackenzie, chief of engineers
of the army; Dr. W JMcGee, geologist and
geographer, now at the head of the St. Louis
Museum; F. H. Newell, Director of the United
States Reclamation (irrigation) Service; Gifford
Pinchot, head of the Forestry Bureau, and

Corporations.

NEW YORK'S PUBLIC UTILITIES BILL

AR more comprehensive than the Inter-
state Commerce act is the Public
Utilities bill recommended by Governor Hughes
and pending in the New York legislature.
This bill comes somewhat as an answer to
Secretary Root's criticism of the failure of the
states to exercise their powers in curbing public
corporations. Constitutionally, the power of
the states is wider than that of the Federal
Government because eminent domain, cor-
porate existence, and capitalization are all
state matters.
The Public Utilities bill proposes to create
a Public Service Commission which shall have

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

charge of all public service corporations except
telephones, including all railroad, express,
gas, and electric companies and pipe lines.
The state is to be divided into two districts,
with a commission for each, Greater New York
being the first district and the other counties
of the state the second. Each commission
in its respective district shall collect all the
facts in regard to public service corporations,
their actual investment, their fares, their ser-
vice, and their capitalization-and shall make
these public. The provisions of the Interstate
Commerce act prohibiting passes, discrimina-
tion, and unreasonable fares are substantially
incorporated.

The further step beyond the United States
law is that the Public Service Commission
shall regulate the issue of stocks and bonds, and
the capitalization of franchises is prohibited.
With the actual investment as the only basis
for capitalization, the annual profits enable the
easy determination of whether fares and freight
rates are excessive.' Where the Commission
deems any rate or fare excessive, it can order a
reduction. It can also compel better train
service and specifically order the improvement
of time tables, the adding of cars, and the run-
ning of additional trains.

The public service corporations have pub-
licly accepted the general plan of the bill, while
offering numerous amendments. The prin-
cipal amendment is to deprive the Commission
of the power to execute its own orders and to
require that it shall go into court as a litigant
before its rulings become effective. That is
the defect in the present New York laws under
which the Railroad Commission has been
unable to enforce its orders. Governor Hughes
opposed this amendment in a public address
and argued that the judicial. review should be
confined to the protection of the constitutional
rights of public service corporations, just as
in all legislation affecting individuals.

GREAT GIFTS FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE

N February 7, 1867, Mr. George Peabody
gave the Peabody Fund of $1,000,000

to a board of trustees, made up of distinguished
men, to be used for the promotion of education
in the Southern States; and the income from
this fund, of which more than two millions and
a half have been spent, has all these years
brought good results. This public benefac-
tion was, for its time, a very large one ; and

the wisdom of Mr. Peabody has been well

.
