HIS B(H'IIOOD ANI) COLLEGE DAYS

EUGENEP.LYLE,JR.

ILLIAM HOWARD TAFT first
became a Presidential possibility
on September Iii, 1857. During

these fifty years, he has had such extract.
dinarily severe training for executing honor-.
ably, safely, and well the Presidential functions
as possibly not one of our Chief Executives
ever had.

As the heavyweight youngster in the primary
school, he buckled to it hardily, instinctively,
for the best there was in him. T h'c,rt,.,,l,,iis"t' was

better in college, for by hard work he had made
it so, and from college he went smilingly,
with honors. A young law student and ncws-
paper reporter, he entered the tourney against
selfish bossism, and he was elected to the pros-
ccutor's office. Loathing meanness, he wanted
every criminal in the penitentiary, and he
ground like the mills of the gods to put him
there. So they raised him to the bench of
the Superior Court of Cincinnati. Then
President Harrison brought him to W ashington
