THE CAPE COD SHIP CANAL

TO CUT OFF 71 MILES OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PART

OF THE TRIP

BY

BETWEEN BOSTON AND NEW YORK

REMSEN CRAWFORD

ITHIN three years Boston will

v ii) be seventy-four miles nearer to New

York by sea and the coastwise ships
of our northeastern seaboard will be saved
from the most dangerous part of their route.

Twenty-three per cent. of all shipwrecks
on the Atlantic shore of the United States occur
on Cape Cod, which rivals even Hatteras in
treachery. According to the reports of the
Government lighthouse keepers, 6,000 steam
vessels and 24,000 sailing vessels annually
pass through the Vineyard Sound route between
New York and Boston. The freight handled
amounts to about 25,000,000 tons, 10,000,000
tons of which are coal for the factories of New
England. The danger to which this important
traffic is constantly subjected around Cape
Cod is shown by the figures of the United States
Life-Saving Service:

From October 1, 1875, to July 1, 1895, 137
vessels were lost, $1,615,245 worth of property
was destroyed, and 63 lives were lost. From July
1, 1895, to January I, 1899, there were on an
average one vessel and one life lost on Cape
Cod every month and a half. As the traffic
grows, this record will probably increase.
Since a comparatively short canal would
eliminate the dangers of this route, it is sur-
prising that the work was not done long ago.

The need of a canal across the narrow part
of Cape Cod was recognized 230 years ago,
and there have been agitations for it from time
to time ever since. In 1676, there was a move-
ment among the inhabitants of the village of
Sandwich, on the northern shores of Cape
Cod peninsula, to construct a waterway from
the north shore to the headwaters of Monu-
ment River, which was then so far navigable
that just a narrow neck of land prevented the
connection. The matter was taken to the
general court of Massachusetts, but nothing
was accomplished. Twenty years later, a
legislative committee was appointed, but it

was not until 1776 that any actual step was
taken. A surveying party began laying out
the route for a canal, but the work was inter-
rupted by the outbreak of the Revolution.
During President Monroe's administration,
while the nation's commerce was on a boom,
the agitation took the shape of a petition to
Congress. But the matter received no friend-
lier recognition than a pigeon-hole at Washing-
ton. The Federal Government caused surveys
to be made in the early 'sixties, but the Civil
War stopped this attempt. In 187 s, the chief
of the Coast Survey reported that the isthmus
could be crossed by a sea-level waterway, but
no actual work was begun. The next move-
ment was on the part of an inventor, Mr. F. A.
Lockwood, of Boston, who hoped to prove the
virtues of a new dredge of his own design by
establishing this almost mythical waterway.
Nearly a mile of the canal had been dug when
the dredge broke down; the death of the in-
ventor about that time ended the work.

At last, Mr. DeWitt Clinton Flanagan, whose
father left him an interest in a vast dredging
enterprise, became interested in the scheme
which for almost 2 30 years had been associated
with idle dreams and wrecked hopes. Mr. Flana-
gan visited the sandy isthmus, tramped across
it, saw with his own eyes what could be done,
and went back to his ofhce to think the matter
over. Could the canal be built? How much
money would it take? Would it pay as an
investment? These were the questions which
had to be settled. He engaged Mr. A. L.
Rives and Mr. E. L. Corthell to determine the
engineering propositions, and dived into statis-
tics himself to figure out the possibilities of
profit in the enterprise. He saw that the canal
could be built, and satisfied himself that it
would be a paying investment. He then
applied to the Massachusetts Legislature for a
charter, depositing with the State Treasurer
the required $200,000.
