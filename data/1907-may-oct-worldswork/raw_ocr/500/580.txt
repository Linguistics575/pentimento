On the tenth day they came out, but not
where a salvage party awaited them with wire
netting. They reached the top of the cafion
at "The Devil's Slide," a faint crease in the
almost perpendicular cliff 2,000 feet high.
Then they started for the nearest telegraph
station.

"Come along Bill!" said Fellows, joyously,
as they began their nine-mile tramp. " There's
beefsteak, and baccy, and a bed at the end of
the road."-C. H. FORBES-LINDSAY.

A SCHOOL THAT GUARDS A TOWNâ€™S FOOD

HE Westfield, Mass., Normal School, a

state institution, has made it practically
impossible to sell adulterated foods in the
town. The groceries, canned goods, meats,
and medicines sold in its best stores may be
used without fear of adulterants. In 1902,
Mr. L. B. Allyn became the teacher of
chemistry. He was quiet and unassuming,
but it was a practical kind of chemistry that he
taught and his pupils were enthusiastic in their
work. Foodstuffs were purchased and ana-
lyzed. Aniline dye, boracic acid, wood alcohol,
and many other adulterants were found in
large and small quantities in these articles of
common domestic consumption.

The people of Westfield heard of the work in
the chemical laboratory of the Normal School.
When they were in doubt about any drugs,
gelatine, milk, or other articles of food, they
began to send them to the school for analysis.
Then the merchants began to hear about Mr.
Allyn. There was adverse criticism of both the
work and the workers. While this was going
on, a judge in a nearby town died from arsenical
poison, supposedly from wall-paper. This
caused much excitement and the townspeople
determined to be careful. A merchant who
had contracted to paper a large dwelling
had the paper analyzed at the school. This,
of course, brought the school into greater
prominence. It also brought forth more criti-
cism, but by this time the people had developed
a faith in the school. The merchants alone
were unconvinced. Mr. Brodeur, the prin-
cipal, invited them to the laboratory. They
saw the pupils extract adultcrants from goods
taken from their own shelves. Wood alcohol was
found in an extract of vanilla, and boric acid
used as a preservative for lambs' tongues. In
some strawberry jam one pupil found apple
stock and aniline dye, and also some seeds.
When planted, the seeds developed into

hardy clover. That was enough. If a drum-
mer wants to sell goods in Westfield now, they
must bear the stamp of approval from the
Normal School. If they are condemned the
merchants do not buy. They have asked and
received the cooperation of the board of health.
A section of its office is reserved for foodstuffs
that have been carefully analyzed and honestly
labeled.

. The school is also educating the people to
avoid injurious medicines. One of the women
residents of Westfield took pills habitually,
which relieved her only temporarily. When
the pain returned she took them again, but
grew worse. A physician told her that her
condition was caused by the pills, but she had
so much faith in them that she discredited the
doctor and continued their use. Some time
later her face became a dark, ashy color,
her respiration was slow, her pulse very low.
Samples of the pills were sent to the Normal
School laboratory for analysis, where they
were found to be highly injurious. As she
had absolute faith in Mr. Allyn's analysis, she
stopped taking them and has regained her
normal health.

The school influence protects honest goods
while exposing the dishonest. A short time
ago a young woman of Springfield was slightly
ill and purchased a remedy which she was in
the habit of taking. After the first dose, she
felt a numbness in her arms; the numbness
increased until, after the third dose, partial
paralysis set in. The physician summoned
thought she showed symptoms of arsenical
poisoning. He sent a sample of the drug to
Mr. Allyn for analysis, and it was found
pure, although the patient showed every in-
dication of poisoning. The druggist who
sold it can appreciate the value of an honest
analysis. Her condition was due to some other
cause.

The school has educated the community
as well as its pupils. It is a live, constructive
force in the town, and it has aroused the
people, the merchants, and the board of
health to a realization df the dangers of
adulterants.

This kind of education is more effective than
pure food laws and it makes such costly
paternalism unnecessary. It is the kind of
education on which the fathers counted when
they framed our government-an education
which would make the people able to take cart
of themselves,
