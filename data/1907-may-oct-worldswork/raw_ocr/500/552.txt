Court is a giver of diplomas for the same
quality. Justices Harlan and Day both sat
in that Court, and Harrison plead before it.
A year after Mr. Taft's appointment, the
late Judge Howell E. Jackson of Tennessee
was promoted to the Supreme Bench, so
that for the next eight years Taft was the
presiding judge. The other two were Judges
Day and Lurton, the latter formerly Chief
Justice of Tennessee, and with these three
there was no thought of domination by any
one of them. They made that court the
greatest subordinate court in the United States,
according to the high respect paid it by the
whole legal profession.

HIS FEARLESSNESS ON THE BENCH

Courage as an adjunct to good citizenship
is a fair descriptive phrase of Mr. Taft's.,ser-
vice on the Bench. The direct way he had
of getting to the gist of a matter, by patient
research combined with an instinctive feeling
for justice, has been mentioned already. His
was no flabby citizenship in a black gown.
When once he saw clearly through a contention,
Judge Taft gave his decision as simply and
naturally as though he were the only man in
the world, as though there were none to criticize,
or to threaten, nor yet one whose vote he might
need later on. This courage, as unconscious
with him as the breath he drew, was the key-
note to his career as judge.

Once he faced a court-room filled with angry
strikers, sent their leader to jail, and broke a
strike that had become a reign of violence.
This happened in 1894, during the terrible
period when Debs and the American Railway
Union, 250,000 strong, were trying to block
every train in the country that hauled a Pull-
man car. Debs sent a turbulent lieutenant
named Phelan "to take the boys out" at Cin-
cinnati. Phelan used both speeches and clubs,
and the strike spread to most of the roads run-
ning out of Cincinnati. But he should have
left the Southern Railway alone, for the
Southern was the Court's road, and Judge
Taft himself had appointed its receiver. The
other roads wanted nothing better than to get
the strike into a Federal court, and the head-
strong Phelan gave them the chance. When
he tried to tie up the Southern, he was enjoined
from interfering with the management of the
receiver's road. But the next night he ha-
rangued the men again. He didn't care, he
roared, even if he were violating injunctions.

TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

Of course, a judge must defend his court from
contempt, so Phelan was placed under arrest.

Judge Taft had been turning other strikers
loose on promises of good behavior. He had
no wish to visit suffering on the deluded and
impassioned. But the case was different with
Phelan. Judge Taft did not delay trial, though
the mob spirit was at its most dangerous tide.
In Chicago, Debs's case was not decided until
long after the strike, but Judge Taft could see
the matter in no other way than that if there
were violation of the law, there should be
punishment in time to stop more crimes of the
same sort. .

Phelan’s trial lasted a week, and it was a
week over a powder magazine. The defense
fought hard, but its greatest reliance was
terrorism. On the third day someone discovered
that Phelan had a signal code with the strikers
who were on the witness stand. He mopped
his brow, or stroked his chin, or twitched his
foot, and the witness answered either "Yes,"
"No," or "I don't know." Phelan was then
moved out of sight of the witnesses, and after
that they were completely at sea.

Almost any judge, in sheer human falli-
bility, would be prejudiced after such tactics,
but an episode occurred that illustrates the
invariable fairness of this particular judge.
One of Phelan’s counsel, a criminal lawyer not
highly respected by the Bar, was making his
argument; Judge Taft, looking up, observed
that an attorney for the receiver and others
were indifferently reading newspapers. The
flare of red that is a danger signal spread over
the Judge's neck. He asked to interrupt the
speaker. And then he said, very sternly:

"This is a court room, not a reading room."

A rattling and folding of papers instantly
followed. The eminent counsel for the receiver
arose, meek and embarrassed, and apologized
Others present, though not even then known
to be in the room, sent contrite letters to Judge
Taft the next morning. Thenceforth the ill-
considered counsel for the defense was listened
to respectfully.

At the close of the trial, Judge Taft an-
nounced that he would render his decision at
twelve o'clock of the fourth day. The first
day he and his secretary worked on it until late
in the evening. The second day they worked
until much later, and the third day until two
in the morning. The secretary then went home
and transcribed his notes until five. At 9:30
he was back at court to find the Judge already
