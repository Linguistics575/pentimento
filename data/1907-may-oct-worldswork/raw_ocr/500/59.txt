millions. Then he planned to build a great
philanthropic institution across the street
from the Carnegie Library. His agents under-
took to buy the property. Mr. Frick had
already bought it.

Mr. Carnegie built a palatial residence on
Fifth Avenue at Ninety-first Street in New
Y ork City. A little while ago, the legislature
of New York authorized the trustees of the
Lenox Library to sell the entire block on Fifth
Avenue between Sixth-ninth and Seventieth
Streets. There has been no denial to the
repeated publication of the statement that Mr.
Frick will be the purchaser, and that he in-
tends to tear down one of the most beautiful
buildings in New York to make way for a
residence that shall excel Mr. Carnegieâ€™s
residence, a few blocks above, in beauty and
in the noble spaciousness of the grounds that
surround it.

These things may all be coincidences, but
the statements of warm friends of both Mr.
Carnegie and Mr. F rick seem to discredit that
assumption. They declare that Mr. Carnegie
has mellowed with years, and that, having no
longer an active business career, he would
willingly be quits with Mr. Frick; but that Mr.
F rick has neither forgotten nor forgiven the past.

Meanwhile, Mr. Frick is in the prime of
business life. Besides the interests that have
been named above, he is a power in the Cam-.
bria Steel Company, the Norfolk and Western
Railroad, and in the Baltimore and Ohio.
His latest active speculations have been in
Reading Railroad stocks. He has only begun
his life as a financier, as distinguished from a
manufacturer.

Mr. F rick's first public appearance in New
York was at the disclosures of corruption in
the Equitable Life Assurance Society. With
many other eminent men, he was on the board
of directors by courtesy and to give the com-
pany distinction. When the late James W.
Alexander and the younger Mr. Hyde made
counter charges of dishonesty against each
other, Mr. Frick was appointed chairman of
the committee to investigate the charges. The
committee reported that the charges of each
were true and recommended that both leave
the company. The committee's report was
killed in a directors' meeting, and the com-
mittee resigned from the board. There has
been no evidence produced to show that Mr.
Frick had any profitable connection with the
funds of the Equitable.

But about this time the opportunity came
for Mr. Frick to ally himself with Mr. Harri-
man. This alliance began with Mr. Frick's en-
trance into the directorate of the Union Pacific,
and has continued until Mr. Frick is now a
member of the Executive Committee. These
friendly relations with Mr. Harriman persist,
becoming daily more apparent in the relations
of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Balti-
more & Ohio.

Mr. Frick's connection with the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad dates back to the days of his
management of the Carnegie Steel Company.
The Pennsylvania handled most of the enor-
mous freight of the steel company, and it was
inevitable that the manager of such vast freight
interests should be compelled to have an
interest in his principal means of trans-
portation. Mr. Frick has increased that inter-
est steadily until to-day he is credited with
the ownership of about $8,590,000 of Pennsyl-
vania Railroad stock.

Mr. F rick's political activities are also inevit-
able results of his business interests. As the head
of the steel business, which, perhaps more than
any other business, owed its enormous growth
and profit to the protective tariff, it was in-
evitable that he should support the Republican
party which maintained that tariff. He is
credited in Pennsylvania with being consistently
one of the largest subscribers to the National
Republican campaign fund. His relations
with the devious paths of the Pennsylvania
state machine are impossible to trace. Only
one story of consequence has been published,
and that can only be repeated on the authority
of the newspapers whose reports were not
denied. Their story was that at the time that
Senator Matthew S. Quay died, the Republican
State Committee of Pennsylvania owed sums
variously estimated to aggregate from $150,000
to more than a million dollars: that the Com-
mittee offered the seat of the late United States
Senator to the man who would pay that debt;
that Mr. Carnegie declined to touch it; and that
finally, at a meeting in Philadelphia of Mr.
F rick, Mr. Cassatt, and representatives of the
Standard Oil Company, the election of Senator
Knox was decided upon, and the bill was paid.
The only obvious substantiation of the story
is the fact that Mr. Knox was at that time Mr.
Frick's personal attorney.

Upon Pittsburg to-day Mr. Frick seems to
have impressed, regarding himself, his own seal
of silence. So powerfully does his influence
