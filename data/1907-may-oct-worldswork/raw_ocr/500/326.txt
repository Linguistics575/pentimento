unnecessary. To give such advice demands no
lesser degree of skill, training, and natural
acumen than does the most difficult surgical
operation. Still, a man will gladly pay $500
to be operated on successfully for appendicitis,
when he would grumble mightily at paying
$50 for a. two hours' discussion with a man
equally trained, who will advise him with
reference to his personal health and habits.
It is the dramatic service of the physician
which at the present time commands public
admiration-that service which is given in
extreme and critical cases, where the physician
is called in to aid Nature to stem the current
of forces making for death and to emphasize
those making for life.

I am dwelling on this point because it is
basal. I am sure there are many persons in the
community who will secure the services and
physicians as I have mentioned, but they
cannot expect the highest grade of service with-
out giving that which corresponds to the fee
paid for other lines of medical service.

WHAT THE DOCTOR REALLY DOES

The doctor no more cures the disease than
the engineer pulls the train. The doctor is
far less important than is the engineer. A
better illustration is that of the pilot on a steam-
boat. Knowing where the vessel is to go, the
pilot can guide it to that port by the shortest,
safest route. If it is necessary to take a chan-
nel where there are rocks, he will know what
the chances are and how to take these chances
to the best advantage. If the vessel strikes
a rock, he will know about the tides, the prob-
able winds, available help, and so on.

All this the doctor can do. In a case of
typhoid fever, where the danger is that the
temperature may become so high as to inter-
fere with vital operations, he can by means of
cold baths or other treatment reduce the tem-
perature, thus permitting Nature to do her own
work more favorably. In the case of a broken
bone, he can see that the two ends are against
each other and that the bone is straight; then
Nature will do the rest. So one might discuss
disorders of vision, with all their reflex effects---
disorders of digestion, and the conduct of the
person under various conditions of disease.

The doctor can guide, although he does not
cure. I would myself no more think of going
without the constant counsel of some other
physician-although this is my specialty--
than I would attempt to form a corporation

involving questions of law without the advice
of a lawyer, or sail my little yacht into a strange
port without a pilot.

The chief service of the physician is to the
man that is well; and it consists not in curing
him when sick, but in keeping him well.

THE COMING SANITARIUM

A new type of sanitarium is surely coming.
The old sanitarium or hospital-and, indeed,
the present one-has for its main object the
cure of disease. This is good, and there must
always be such hospitals and sanitariums.
But the great thing is not to cure, but to teach
people higher habits of living.

It is not so fine a thing as at first glance it
appears to take a broken-down man or woman
and restore the patient to health. He goes
back under the same old conditions, and, as
shown by cases on record, it is probable that he
will break down again. The really great
thing to do is to take these people and not
merely restore them to conditions of health and
efficiency, but so to reconstruct their daily
lives and habits that thereafter they will live
normally.

To accomplish such results, the patient
must be under the direction of the physician
far longer than the custom is at present. The
supervision that is needed for health education
could be carried out in this way:

Within an hour of the centre of New York
City there should be huilt a thoroughly
equipped, modern home, hospital and sanitarium
combined. There should be a large expanse
of rolling country land around it. The house
should be so arranged that every room would
have sunlight. It should be beautiful, cheer-
ful, and thoroughly comfortable. There should
be reading rooms and libraries, gymnasiums,
bowling alleys, music rooms, workshops,
skating rinks, golf links, and swimming pools.
There should exist opportunities for boating,
canoeing, and sailing.

CORRECT HABITS OF LIVING 'AND WORKING

All this should be under expert counsel. The
proportion of physicians to patients should
be something like one to twelve. Every
person should be put upon a course of work
designed to restore him to health, and he
should be put upon this work as soon as it was
feasible for him to begin. These periods of
work should be steadily lengthened day by
day, until the time arrived when the man or
