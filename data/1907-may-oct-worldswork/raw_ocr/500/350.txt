nations is itself more and more a safeguard.
As far back as the middle of the last century,
Napoleon III. gave up his plan to help drive
the Austrians out of Italy b: cause the mere
rumor of such an intention created a panic on
the Bourse. Years later, the French nation
pocketed its resentment over the British
occupation of Egypt, because that occupation
was followed by a steady rise in the value of
the Egyptian bonds held largely by the F rench
people. Similarly to-day, England and Amer-
ica are held in bonds of commerce so
strongly that an eminent British statesman
is said to have suggested that in case of
war England burn the warehouses of Liver-
pool and America the warehouses of New
York as the first step in the struggle.
And if we went to war with Japan to-day, the
first result would be that the American holders
of over a hundred million dollars of Japanese
bonds would see a large part of that property
disappear.

The very essence of the peace movement
seems to lie in this matter of com.mcrce. The
problem that brought it to life seems to have
been strangely compounded of humanitarianism
and of commercialism. First, it is the prob-
lem of saving life. Second, it is the problem
of using the life thus saved for the further
development of the world. Third, it is the
problem of diverting the billions of dollars

that would be wasted in war to the develop-
ment of the world and the increasing of its
commerce.

Lelving cut rt co.t1sidcraticr, the actual
cost of wars, the advocate of peace has a good
argument in the immense amount of money
expended by the nations on preparations for
war. Ten European nations and the United
States spent upon their armies in 1889
$873,423,401. The combined armies, upon
a peace footing, numbered 2,755,000. The
armies of the same nations upon a war foot-
ing would have numbered 8,062,000. If,
either throtog'1 the peace movement or through
the continued growth of the commercial spirit,
one-half of the annual peace-basis expenditure
of these nations can be diverted so that in the
year 1925 it will go to the opening of new
industrial or agricultural regions in Africa, by
just so much the world would be the richer.

It is only within the last half-century that
war for war's sake has ceased to be a con-
ventional thing among the nations. To-day a
wanton war is liable to be stopped by the
waving of the club of one of the world's police-
men---the United States, Britain, Germany, or
France. Y et the condition of the world re-
mains a condition of armed neutrality, so
delicately balanced that its equilibrium may
be threatened even by so insignificant an in-
dividual as a Castro of Venezuela.
