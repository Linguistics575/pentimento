" For," he went on, "bridges will be here all
our lives, during the lives of our children and
of their children and of their children, as long
as this shall be a city. Every house now stand-
ing here may be torn down or modified, for
most buildings are temporary. But a road
and a bridge are eternal things. They will
remain as long as the stream runs.

"Here is a chance, then, to construct one of
the most beautiful things in the world, perhaps
the best chance that the city affords. If we
had been patient and wise enough to have made
bridges that should be beautiful, we should
have added to the charm of our city for ever.
This was a great opportunity lost."

The feeling of this man is the feeling of the
art societies-the American Institute of Archi-
tects, the Fine Arts Federation and the Society
of Beaux Arts-which have appointed a com-
mittee to petition Congress to establish a
Federal Department of F ine Arts, the head of
which shall be a member of the President's
Cabinet. The Department should have "super-
vision of government works, the erection of
public buildings, the laying out of national
parks, the establishment of museums and
galleries in various cities, the acquirement of
works of art and the stimulation of universities
and colleges in the education of art."

This is a very comprehensive programme
which will encounter many practical objections,
and it is not likely to be carried out in this
form or perhaps in any form at any early time.
But there is a profitable field for popular
education up to an appreciation of this purpose.
Within a generation or two the United States
might surpass any land in the world in the
beauty of its public works and places, if we
should go about it right; for we are just begin-
ning an era of ambitious and, to a degree,
permanent construction.

THE ABOLITION OF DISEASE
IT IS EASY, following the analogy of some

foreign giwernments, to suggest the
creation of additional departments of our
national governnient with new members of the
President':; Cabinet as their heads. But there
are few innovations more difficult to bring
about.

But the movement, which has lately gathered
much force, to 'extend the powers and duties
and responsibilities of the Government in guard-
ing the public health, is likely to lead-if not
to a Department with representation in the

MARCH OF EVENTS

Cabinet-to a wider range of governmental
activity; and there is no other such extension
of public activity for which so strong an art?tr-
ment can be made.

In one of the most instructive books of recent
years, "The Kingdom of Man," Professor
E. Ray Lankester, the foremost of English
biologists, makes it plain that civilized govern-
ments must increase their activity in combating
diseases, especially in preventing them. There
is no other agency that can do the task ade-
quately, because no other agency can exercise
control over masses of people.

"Within the past few years," he writes, "the knowledge
of the causes of disease has become so far advanced that
it is a matter of practical certainty that, by unstinted
application of known methods of investigation and con-
sequent controlling action, all epidemic disease could be
abolished within a period so short as ffty years. It is merely
a question of the employment of the means at our command.
Where there is one man of first-rate intelligence employed
in detecting the disease-producing parasites, their special
conditions of life and the way to bring them to an end,
there should be a thousand. It should be as much the
purpose of civilized governments to protect their citizens
in this respect as it is to provide defence against human
aggression. Yet it is the fact that this immensely important
control of a great and constant danger and injury to man-
kind is left to the unorganized inquiries of a few enthusiasts.
So little is this matter understood or appreciated, that
those who are responsible for the welfare of states, with the
rarest exceptions, do not even know that such protection
is possible."

He goes on:

"The explanation is that the masses of the people, in
civilized as well as uncivilized countries, are not yet aware
of the situation. When knowledge on this matter reaches,
as it inevitably will in time, to the general population, it is
certain that the democracy will demand that those who
expend the resources of the community, and, as government
officials. undertake the organization of the national defence
and other great public services for the common good,
shall put into practice the power of Nature-control which
has been gained by mankind, and shall exert every sinew
to obtain more. To effect this, the democracy will demand
that those who carry on public affairs shall not be persons
solely acquainted with the elegant fancies and stories of
past ages, but shall be trained in the acquisition of natural
knowledge and keenly active in the skilful application of
Nature-control to the development of the well-being of
the community."

The growing organization to carry this very
idea into action is securing the support of
influential men of all callings.
