THE T RADITIONAL LAUND RY

The women rub the clothes on the round stones of the river-bed
and dry them on the bank. The milk-cans prove that the photograph

STATES IN PORTO RICO

But most of the roads of the interior were
tortuous trails over which no wheeled vehicle
of any description could pass. A single ride
from Adjuntas to Utuado and thence northeast
to the capital would furnish the most adven-
turous with "thrills" enough to last him for a
long time. Here are a few experiences that
will soon exist only in thc nightmares of
American cavalry horses:

Between Adjuntas and Utuado, avalanches

who did not wish to risk his life needlessly
would dismount, take the bridle rein and crawl
around the landslide in front of his horse, so
that if the latter went over the precipice, he
need not follow. A little further on would be a
mountain torrent, in crossing which the horse

plunges down the mountain sides where the
horse seemed in danger of turning somersaults;
there were rugged slopes as steep as the roof
of a house up which one must climb for half a
mile or more. Even when traveling in a hori-
zontal direction, the trail was full of mud that
held the hoofs like glue, and dug out by the
