pupil of the School and the winner of the Cragges
Prize for his observations in connection with
the trypanosome. It was also a pupil of the
School, Dr. Forde, who first discovered, in the
Gambia colony, the presence of this parasite
in the blood of a patient. The parasite was
subsequently recognized by Dr. Dutton of the
sister school at Liverpool, as belonging to a
group of germs responsible for many grave
diseases among the lower animals.

Subsequent observations by Colonel Bruce
and others have, says Sir Patrick Manson,
wholly endorsed the truth and importance of
Dr. Castellani's discovery. Nor is this all. A
past student of the School was one of those who
aided in the proof of the mode of propagation
of yellow fever in Cuba; another first showed
that the African lick-fever is due to a
parasite closely related to that of relapsing
or famine fever .

While every student has an opportunity of
distinguishing himself or herself in original
research, each one, so far as teaching can ensure,
leaves the laboratories absolutely qualified for
actual practice in the tropics. They have seen,
and most of them have applied for themselves,
the most recent methods of diagnosis, and they
have seen in operation the methods of treatment
of the best repute. This practical education
not only increases the value of future work from
a scientific point of view, but it has an actual
commercial value. If employers are enabled,
through the improved health-conditions of troy-
ical countries, to send out a better class of men,
and to keep them there, the gain is enormous.

The British Government has so far contrib-
uted about $22,000 toward the establishment
of the school, of which nearly $5,000 came from
the India Office. As a result of Sir Francis
Lovell's efforts, donations of $500 each were
sent by the governments of Hong Kong, the
Straits Settlements, and the Federated Malay
States. Among private benefactors, the name
of Sir John Cragges stands out as the founder,
for three years, of a traveling scholarship, held
by Dr. G. C. Low, and subsequently of a school
prize for the most valuable contribution to
tropical medicine during the year.

In recognition of its importance, the school
has recently been admitted by the Senate as a
School of the University of London.

Disease still decimates native populations and

. sends men home from the tropics prematurely

old and broken down. Until the white man has
the key to the problem, this blot must remain.
To bring large tracts of the globe under the
white man's rule has a grandiloquent ring; but
unless we have the means of improving the con-
dition of the inhabitants, it is scarcely more
than an empty boast.
