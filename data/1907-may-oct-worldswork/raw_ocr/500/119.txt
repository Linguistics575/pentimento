new ideas, and new ideals. But the first year
in day school was different, because I had in a
measure assimilated many of these new ideas.
While I learned a great deal from books during
my night-school year, that was insignificant as
compared with the indescribable something
--very real at Hampton-which I cannot
express in writing, but which was very tangible.
In the Junior year, I came in contact daily
with half a dozen or more lady teachers of the
sturdy New England type; while many of
their subjects were not entirely new, the pre-
sentation was so different and they touched so
practically upon everyday life that I found
myself for the first few months in a realm
almost as strange as during my first year at
Hampton. Perhaps the most striking subject
during my Junior year was zoology, taught by
Miss Ford, who afterward became the wife of
General Armstrong. The investigation and
dissecting of insects and animals of various
sorts was a constant and appalling revelation
to me of my dense ignorance of the things with
which I had been dealing all my life. There
are few teachers who could have aroused her
pupils to more enthusiastic work than did Mrs.
Armstrong.

At the close of school, in June, I was pro-
moted to the Middle class. I asked that I
might remain at Hampton and work during
the summer vacation, for the $80 saved during
my twelve months of work at the sawmill was
considerably reduced. So I was given work
as janitor of one of the boys' dormitories and
also of the academic building, for we had night
school in the summer then. It was to me a very
pleasant summer. I went home for a two
weeks' vacation in August-my first trip since
I had come to Hampton, nearly two years be-
fore. I was anxious to see my parents and
friends, but I think I was even more anxious
to show my uniform with its first-lieutenant's
shoulder-straps. Everybody seemed glad to
see me--the white as well as the colored people
--and the older white people were especially
cordial. The young white men with whom I
had grown up avoided me whenever possible.
This I could not then understand.

The Middle year was not very different from
the Junior. The subject that had the greatest
influence upon my life was the theory and
practice of teaching, which they now call
pedagogies. I think they were afraid to call
it by such a big name in my day, for fear it
might frighten us. It was then the rule at

8917

Hampton that every student was required to
teach for at least one term before entering upon
his Senior studies, so a part of the course in
practice teaching was taken up in the Middle
year. I don't know whether the impression
made upon me was due as much to the subject
in hand as to the teacher. We had a sort of
conference on human nature-l suppose they
would call it psychology now-and I feel the
influence of those conferences to this day.

In June I was promoted to the Senior class
and given a certificate recommending me to
teach in the schools of Virginia, provided I
passed an examination satisfactory to the
state school officials. That summer I spent as
headwaiter at a hotel in Pennsylvania, but
hotel life did not appeal to me.

When the season closed, I returned home
and secured a school in Cumberland County,
early in September. As my school was not
to open before the middle of October, I secured
work on the farm in the meantime from a Mr.
Walthall, a white neighbor of my people. It
surprised the colored community to have a
boy who had gone to school, finished his
"eddication" (as they supposed), passed the
county examination, and been appointed a
teacher, go out on a. farm and work as a day
laborer. It also surprised my white neighbors,
and many of them came over to the field where
I worked to see if it were really true. It was a,
sort of curiosity in those days to see a colored
school-teacher working as a farm laborer. I
opened school about the middle of October with
something like half a dozen pupils. The number
increased daily until on the first of November
I had over TOO and by December there were
150. I asked for an assistant teacher, which
was granted me. The school was located in a
fine community where an unusually large num-
ber of colored people owned their own land
and where a great many more were graduallly
buying farms. There were four Negro
churches within a radius of five miles and there
were enough people to support them--4he way
they were supported. Fortunately, they had
preaching at each church about once a month,
so that the teachers could generally get around
to each church at every meeting-day. They
were always expected to speak and also to
teach a Sunday-school class. I enjoyed this
work very much. It is easy for a N egro teacher
to get the respect and confidence of his people
and he can do almost anything with them if
he leads an earnest, honorable life among them.
