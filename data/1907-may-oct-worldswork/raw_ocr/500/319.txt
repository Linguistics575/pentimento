WHAT FRANCE

We associate frivolity with the French people;
rather ought we to think of them as incredibly
industrious and as taxing their wits to enlarge
their industrial efficiency. When the workers
of America catch their zest and their well-
thought-out schemes for application, we shall
distance our own best record.

THE FRENCH SAVE THE SOUS

And as the Gallic mind abhors futility in
industry, so it abhors futility in the disposal of
the wages of industry. A Frenchman once
said to me, "You Americans don't know how
to spend money; you waste it." After a
long sojourn among us, he had concluded that
in our handling of money we displayed pre-
cisely the traits we attribute to the French--
heedlessness, impulsiveness, and an extreme
volatility. And when you know France as
well as he knew America, you will be inclined
to agree with him. Back of F rench thrift lies
a series of virtues all too rare in America---
consistency, constancy, self-restraint, serious-.
ness, and especially the readiness to conceive
of a man's life as a whole, to plan out that
whole, and to live up to that plan with heroic
determination.

"Paris/laid George Warrington Steevens,
"is a place where they save sous." It is more
than that. What the tourist usually sees tells
only a tithe of the story. He sees parades
of "mutualistes" (societies for saving); he sees
shop-keepers wrapping parcels in old news-
papers; he sees children wearing black pina-
fores to protect their clothes; he sees countless
establishments for mending and dyeing; he
sees the middle-class Parisienne lift her precious
skirt, ere she takes a seat upon a bench at
the wayside, and sit upon her less precious
Petticoat; he sees people eating forgotten por-
tions of beeves and sheep. Then he says
wisely, "Ah, yes! Steevens was right. Paris
is a place where they save sous." Once, being
in a great hurry, I boarded a street-car within
four blocks of the end of the line. That is,
I partly boarded it. The conductor, beside
himself with compassion, put me off and
shouted back to me, " Good heavens, monsieur,
this car is going only four blocks!" Not for
half a kingdom would he have allowed a fellow
mortal to pay a fare for so short a ride! As
this happened when I was new to Gallic ways,
I thought it expressed the very essence of
French frugality.

It didn't though. The essence of the phenome-

non is not in the daily savings; it is in the
application of sagacity to the problem of one's
economic lifetime. Taking a bird's-eye view
of his entire earning and spending career, your
typical Frenchman sets before himself two
perfectly definite objects-the one to provide
for the marriage dowries of his children, the
other to provide for his own retirement from
business. Accordingly, he apportions his in-
come so as to "equalize his budget" and save
a predetermined yearly sum. If his income
is small, he will always ride on top of an omni-
bus for three cents instead of inside it for six,
always sit on a green bench in the park for
nothing instead of in a rented chair for a penny,
always travel second-class or third, always
buy an inexpensive seat at the play.

Possessing this scrupulously calculated code
of economies, carried out to the minutest
detail till it becomes a sort of second nature,
your Frenchman prepares his soul for gaiety.
His lightheartedness is largely temperamental,
of course, but it is at the same time due in no
small measure to his sense of security in money
matters, his consciousness that he is getting on
in the world, however ploddingly, and his
freedom from that self-reproof which so
grievously embitters the existence of the rasher
and less reasonable American.

As for the objects of French thrift-the
marriage dowry and the retirement from busi-
ness-what more sensible? When the parents
arrange the marriages of their children, there
is small room for romance, to be sure, but
also small risk of divorce. The quarrels that
disrupt the family here in America spring
largely from difficulties regarding money. In
F rance, the wedded pair are capitalized at the
outset. They begin their married life on even
terms, as partners. Indeed, M adame has
sometimes as shrewd an insight into commercial
affairs as Monsieur, perhaps more so. While
the young man was serving his two years with
the colors, the young woman, very likely, was
getting two years' business training-for some-
body must take the soldier's place; and more
girls, possibly, are at work in France than here.
So the husband comes early to rely upon his
wife's judgment. He naturally assumes that
you cherish an equal reverence for that of your
own wife. Drop into "Style House" (how
these F renchrnen adore English names!) to
purchase a Derby hat, and you find that it is
the French wife, not the F rench husband, who
fixes the price-after long and impassioned
