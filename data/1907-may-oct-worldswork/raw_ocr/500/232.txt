geographically, it is the" logical port for a vast
area west and southwest of it; and the building
of the new railroad from the mountains, with
a very gradual grade, is a significant event.
It is perhaps the best food-market that we
have-sea-food from Chesapeake Bay and
fruit and vegetables and game from the country
nearby.

"I used to know everybody that I saw on
the streets," said an old resident, "but during
the last year or two I do not know one in ten."

A man who went from Pennsylvania to
Norfolk to live was asked why he went: "I
read the papers and saw that nobody was selling
out. All the things that were for sale here
denoted improvement, not motion backward."

One indication of the growth of organization
is the career of The Eastern Shore of Virginia
Produce Exchange, started in 1900 with Soo
members. Now it has the patronage of more
than 2,500 growers, and has increased its
business from $250,000 to $1,500,000.

Charleston has long kept stationary, and its
Negro population has increased. It is a
charming old city, with a proud social quality
and an antique flavor. Invitations to the balls
of the St. Cecilia Society are yet delivered by
hand not by post, just as they were before the
post-office was established. But, after years
of resting, this old city, too, has felt the touch
of modern ways.

No one knows our country who has not
spent some time in Charleston and in New
Orleans; and their foreign qualities are fast
passing. New Orleans was foreign because of
its French population; Charleston because it
was inbred for 200 years; or, perhaps, the
better way to say it is, that Charleston remained
'American and the rest of the United States
in varying degrees and in many ways moved
on-away from Colonial life.

Truck farming is not limited to the coast. Its
area extends to considerable distances inland.
At Goldsboro, N. C., for instance, its influence
is felt. This is not only a trucking centre
itself but it has a large jobbing trade for a
wide area, and it is fast becoming a manu-
facturing city; and it has become, in conse-
quence, a new town-new in fact and new
in spirit. It holds a place of honor for the
early energy that it showed in developing its
schools in modern ways.

The whole coast line is a garden, and
much of the Gulf coast, far on into Texas.
How vast and profitable this industry is, a

short description of cabbage culture near
Charleston will show. The following facts
were gathered by Mr. J. A. Hoyt, of
Charleston:

Between $7,000,000 and $9,000,000 worth
of fruit and vegetables are sent every year
from South Carolina. Cabbage, potatoes,
asparagus, lettuce, snap-beans, strawberries,
in the order named, are the staples; but carrots,
radishes, cauliflower, onions, tomatoes, egg-
plants, beets, and peas are grown. Fields of
200 to 300 acres of cabbages are not uncommon,
and there is one planter who has 1,000 acres.
This man began as a farm laborer fifteen years
ago, with a monthly wage of (ho. He came
from Georgiaand his wife taught him to read.
Now it costs him $1ro,ooo to plant and to
cultivate his crop. His telegraph bill, to keep in
touch with a changing market, runs up to $100
a day. The shipping sheds require seven
miles of railroad siding to accommodate them.
At the little station called Meggett, six large
locomotives are required to do the shifting at
the loading season. The cutting season lasts
from the middle of March to the middle of
May. -

For thirteen miles, in one place, nothing is
visible from the seat of a buggy but cabbage.
The whole world seems made of cabbage, and
they are hauled away at the rate of 200 carloads
a day. Buyers come there from many markets.
In the main shipping office there are telegraph
operators, a number of stenographers, book-
keepers, and shipping clerks. Sometimes, on
a single day, shipments will be made to half
the states in the Union. Of the 200 cars that
leave Meggctt daily, each contains 200 crates,
a total of 40,000 cratcs-$60,cxxy worth of
cabbagcs shipped daily from one little station
for about two months.

Two men from Rhode Island went to Beau-
fort, S. C., and began planting truck. Last
year they netted $10,000 from 36 acres of
radishes, two crops on the same ground. These
two radish crops were followed by a crop of
beets; the beets were in turn followed by a
crop of cucumbers, and the cucumbers by
corn-five crops a year!

There are some 30,000 acres planted in
truck around Charleston. An average yield
of $150 an acre brings $4,soo,ooo to this city
alone. The total is really larger because this
calculation takes in only the main crop and
there are several crops a year.

As of almost all the other capitals, most of
