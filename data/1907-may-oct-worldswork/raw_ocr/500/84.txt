The striking thing to be observed from the
data of the last eighteen months is that the
shifting of proportions which stands out so
clearly in these figures is still in progress and
is gaining rather than losing in speed and
sweeping character. The hope which those
best acquainted with the situation have cher-

of the Teutonic, and therefore of the more
acceptable, type of immigrant, has thus far
completely failed of realization. Without ex-
ception, England, Ireland, Germany, Sweden,
Denmark, and Scotland, which until a genera-
tion ago supplied by far the larger part of our for-..
eign population, contributed fewer immigrants
in 1906 than in 1905, while the four whose gains
were largest were Italy, Russia, Greece, and
Turkey. Austria-Hungary alone of southern
and eastern European countries exhibited
a decrease, and there is no reason for regarding
this apparent cause for rejoicing as other than
an isolated and more or less accidental Phenom-
enon quite devoid of significance. Of every
100 aliens landed at our ports in 1906, 37
were Slavic, 28 were Iberic, 19 were Teutonic,
and II were Celtic; that is, 65 came from
southern and eastern Europe and Asia Minor,
but only 30 from the countries to the north and
west. Obviously we, as a predominantly

Teutonic people, are undertaking a problem
of assimilation which dwarfs all such problems
with which our fathers and grandfathers were
called upon to deal.

It would be a hitherto unparalleled problem
