9462 THE DAWN OF A NEW
quite different from one in this country. A
discordant brass band marches at the head of
the men when they start for work at daybreak.
"There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town
To-night" is the tune, and the men know
every note of it, for it is played at the Sunday
cock-fights, in the churches, for dances, and
even at funerals.

Gaily the men troop along, whistling with the
band or shouting in a sorry attempt to pro-
nounce the English words. Loin-cloth and
straw hat suffice for clothing, and their beauti-
fully moulded bodies shine like burnished
copper. Arriving at a great cut in a mountain
side, they are handed their time checks by the
foremen, who are also natives, and work begins
in earnest. The band takes up its station
under a cacao tree and keeps the music going.
A young college man in charge of the camp
gallops up on a flea-bitten pony and climbs to
a high platform from which he can watch the
progress of the work. The tropical sun beats
down with the heat of a blast furnace, and
naked water-boys with hides of water and
cocoanut cups pass among the toilers. Earth
and rock are loaded into small cars and pushed
down a snaky track to be dumped into a ravine
two hundred yards away.

When the whistle blows at noon, the foremen
distribute peseta pieces to the workers, who
quickly pass them over to the crude lunch
"shacks" for a wholesome meal of rice and
boiled vegetables. When natives were first
hired, it was noticed that they would "loaf"
around at noon without eating, and were unfit
for work in the afternoon. They were told
through an interpreter that they should use a
part of their wages for lunch, but they were not
impressed with the plan. Finally an ingen-
ious American hit upon the scheme of doling
out a peseta at noon for lunch, and there was
no more trouble.

After the mid-day heat has somewhat abated,
work starts again. The bandmaster quickens
the tempo like a cockswain hitting up the stroke
in a 'varsity race, and the men charge the
mountain side with yells, swinging picks in
time with the music. As darkness falls they
return to camp, chattering and placing bets on
the next cock-fight. The camp is laid out in
streets with military precision, with neatly
thatched nipa huts for the men and roomy tents
for the Americans in charge. The camp site
is well drained and has a hospital tent with
white cots and a trained nurse.

ERA

IN THE PHILIPPINES

A long, thatched building filled with tables
is the rendezvous of the men at night. Here
they are served with a well-cooked supper.
Then the wives and children of the Filipinos,
resplendent in gay calicos, dance until 10:30,
when all the workmen are sent to bed..

While the dance is in progress, some stocky
Igorrote, attired in a loin-cloth and battered
derby hat, cautiously lifts the flap of head-.
quarters tent, where the engineers are figuring
up the pay-roll. Edging up to the interpreter,
he begins a plaintive recital. The interpreter
listens with a smile.

" He's been up in the hills, burying his grand-
mother," he said, turning to the chief.

"What's your number?" asks the chief.

A brass tag about the man's neck supplies
the .information. Turning to his book, the
timekeeper looks up the man's record.

"Well, I'll let him off this time; it's only the
ninth that I have record of !"

The Filipino clings to the "grandmother
fable " and uses it blandly upon every occasion.
It is difficult to keep him at work during the
entire month; once or twice during that period
he disappears for a couple of days, but he
invariably returns to work with the time-worn
explanation.

This camp is duplicated at intervals along
the 600 miles of railroad now under con-
struction, each camp presided over by a young
American, recruited from Purdue, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Cornell, Massachusetts "Tech.,"
and other technical colleges. Nearly all have
had several years of practical railroading under
the best builders and operators in the country,
and they are demonstrating what young
engineers can do when thrown upon their own
resources thousands of miles from home.

THE NATIVE AS A WORKMAN

The Filipino was not a promising laborer.
An American contractor who converted the
old horse-car lines of Manila into a model
electric system advertised for laborers; when
several hundred had been gathered in, they
were offered inducements to start at once.
A shaking of heads and mutterings in several
dialects was translated by the interpreters into
a refusal to begin without having first been paid
the week's wage. It seems that it had been
customary during the Spanish regime to engage
Filipinos to perform certain work, upon the
completion of which they were paid only a
portion of the promised sum or dismissed
