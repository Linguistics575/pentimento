A UNIVERSITY PUEBLO

A REPRODUCTION BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO OF
AN ANCIENT INDIAN PUEBLO, ADAPTED TO COLLEGE USES

BY

E. DANA

N the campus of the University of New
0 Mexico, in Albuquerque, are two
quaint college buildings-the begin-

nings of a group that will give a new lease of life
to a building type long obsolete. These struct-
ures arc to reproduce in plan and architecture
the ancient Indian pucblo----not the modern
pueblo of Arizona and New Mexico, with its
mixture of Spanish types. The entire group
will follow the details of the old towns with such
fidelity that it would startle the long-dead
pueblo-dwellers if they could see it. Of course,
the general style exists in the many Indian
villages of Arizona and New Mexico, but it
degenerated greatly through the Spanish in-

fluence, as the University buildings will show
when they completely reproduce the original
style.

The model for this college pueblo is the pre-
historic town of Sikyatki, perhaps the oldest of
the communal towns in this part of the world.
It was situated in northern Arizona, amid
limitless deserts and frowning mesas, in that
strange land of sunshine and silence. In this
isolated region, where the Moquis hold their
snake-dances and blanket Indians climb to
their homes on precipitous cliffs, are the
Tusayan pueblos, occupied by small remnants
of tribes that had reached a remarkable degree
of Civilization.
