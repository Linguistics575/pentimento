live, having the soft Gulf climate that is not
oppressive in summer and is warm in winter.
It is the nearest Gulf port to the Panama
Canal. It has 16 public schools (8 for white
and 8 for colored) for a population of 25,000; It
has good railroad facilities; and the new energy
and foresight and ambition of the Southern
town-builders of to-day. It is one of the sea-
ports for a wide inland territory, extending

as far north as Kentucky, and one of the
United States navy yards is located there.

Inland Florida, too, has well-kept, prosperous
towns. Orlando is a good example. In it and
all round about it-in this beautiful lake
country-many persons spend pleasant, quiet
winters; and there are prosperous orange and
grape-fruit groves; and at Sanford are the fam...

THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

HE lower Mississippi Valley has under-

gone less radical change than any other
great section of the South. But it, too, has
felt the touch of prosperity. Cotton culture
has always been, and is yet, the chief industry
of this rich region and it probably always will
be; but there are careful students of agriculture
who expect a very large acreage to be given to
corn, when more of the lands have been drained.
These lowlands have two great sources of profit;
first, their timber, in some places long-leaf
pine and in other regions hardwoods. Since
the recent rapid increase in the price of lum-
ber, these forests have been opened with great
rapidity and the lumber trade at every im-
portant shipping port has its millionaires.
The hardwoods in Tennessee and Arkansas,
for example, are also being cut with great
rapidity. One great source of income at
Memphis and at Nashville is from the sale of
hardwoods. The gum tree, for instance, was,
until a few years ago a despised growth of the
swamps; now it is not only sold throughout
the United States, but large quantities of it are
exported; and for interior finishes it takes so
fine a polish that in some cases it is sold as
mahogany.

For many years to come the lumber industry
of this region will be an important business.
It would be an important business for all time
to come if the forests were so cut as to make
their yield perpetual.

The cotton-growing of this area has grad-
ually increased in acreage in the most pro-
gressive communities. The methods employed
are more skilful than they used to be and, of
course, the profit has become greater as the
price of cotton has risen. This region, there-
fore, has a new era in its prosperity. The one
great drawback to the extension of cotton cul-
ture is the lack of labor, and it is to this region

that Italians are gradually coming, and more
will come by way of Louisiana.

The prosperity that comes from lumber and
cotton has shown itself here in the building up
of towns and cities such as Memphis, which is
having a most remarkable commercial develop-
ment, and Jackson, Miss., which ten years ago
was a sleepy capital of an undeveloped common-
wealth, and which has now completely rebuilt
itself and is a small city of extraordinary growth
in trade and in population. Vicksburg, Shreve-
port, Meridian, and the shipping town which
has grown up at Gulfport are other
examples. At Gulfport, ships are loaded with
lumber from Mississippi which sail to almost
every port in the world. Long stretches of the
Gulf coast are now built up as resorts for
Northern people in winter and for Southern
people from cities in summer, and a consider-
able region here is becoming an interesting
seashore playground.

Very great changes will come within a
generation in these Mississippi Valley lands.
As soon as the world in general finds out that
the culture of the cotton plant in this rich soil
is perhaps the most profitable agriculture,
certainly of a great staple, that can be carried
on anywhere in our continental area; and, as
soon as the additional fact is fully appreciated
that good drainage will make this region a
perfectly healthful place for white men to live
in, it must come to pass that a vast population
will go there. When a vast population goes
there and better methods of cotton culture
become general, the lower Mississippi Valley
will maintain an even denser population than
the states of the upper Mississippi Valley;
and there are good reasons why they should
be as prosperous as their Northern neighbors.

Here we come face to face with interesting
problems of several kinds. One is the problem
