9346 THE EFFECTS OF
do wrong. We fail from the inside; we haul
down the flag deliberately, by our own consent,
just because we have got tired of fighting; and
then the enemy walks in. I am not now
referring to the making of mistakes: our
ignorance often compels us to do that. Mak-
ing mistakes isn't an item that can be debited
to conscience. But I mean the conscious and
deliberate doing of a thing that we know isn't
in line with sound morals.

Everybody is guilty of such faults; he does
what he oughtn't to do; and he knows that he
oughtn't to do it. He says: "What the -!''
--and lets it go at that. He sits up late at
night when he knows he ought to be in bed;
he even enjoys it. He could do otherwise if
he tried. He doesn't try; he's tired of trying.
We get into the mood of wanting a holiday
from all that sort of thing. I'm not defending
this specific variety of holiday habit: I am
simply noting its existence.

For therein lies the fallacy of the doctrine
of perfect living. The will can't stand up to
the doctrine. It "caves in." It yields to
anger, to worry, to fear, to appetite-to what-
ever one's own specialty may be in these
lines. Afterward comes a time when we feel
ashamed of ourselves, and make up our minds
.---if we are normal human beings-to put up
a stiffer fight next time. And perhaps we do.
That's the way life goes.

But if it were not for fatigue of the will, we
could stay all the time on our best level. We
could always keep doing the highest things of
which we are capable, without a let-down.

FATIGUE IS NOT ABNORMAL

I do not wish to give the impression by all
this that fatigue is an abnormal thing, an
enemy seeking to make shipwreck of us. On
the contrary, it is a perfectly inevitable and
normal result of work; and work is one of
life's choicest commodities.

Fatigue, indeed, is the price of growth.
The muscle to be vigorous and strong must
be put to hard use-must get tired. But it
must also be given a fair chance to get rested
and rebuild its broken-down tissues. Destruc-
tion, reconstruction-reconstruction on a larger
scale-that is the fundamental law of healthful
living, bodily or mental. If we were never
tired, we should never be strong.

But it certainly is important that a man
should know the dangers to which fatigue ex-
poses him-where it makes him weak for the

MENTAL FATIGUE

time being, where and how it reduces his power
of resistance, what things it unfits him for,
how it alters his personality. Since it is a
thing which each of us has to deal with, whether
he wants to or not, it's worth our while to deal
with it intelligently.

A fatigued will exposes us on every side.
When there is big business on hand, we cannot
afford to have our powers of decision reduced
and distorted. And they need not be if we
have learned the lesson of will economy.

Will is a thing you can waste just like your
cash. You can throw it away on little things
that don't count, on petty decisions, trivialities;
and when the moment comes for the important
decision, it's exhausted, and either balks or
goes wrong.

It happens occasionally, I hope, that after
the close of the day's work somebody takes
you out to dinner. What a relief it is-sup-
pose it's an EL la carte affair-to sit back in
your chair, at perfect peace with the world,
and watch your friend do the ordering. How
you enjoy the privilege of not having to make
up your mind again about anything. You
look with pity upon him as he wanders in a
daze of indecision among a score or two of
interesting-looking eatables and drinkables.

Right in that matter, I take it, lies the great
attraction for most of us in the table d'hifte
meal; it relieves the mind of a problem which,
after all is said and done, isn't worth the bother
of solution. Utterly free of responsibility,
you simply watch the series of good things
appearing, one after another; and you know
that the process will go through satisfactorily.

The table d'hifte dinner isn't a perfect
illustration of my point; but I chose it because
it is in just such insignificant matters as that
that the principle of will economy can be most
easily applied. Similar occasions recur over
and over again every day in a man's work.

Everyone knows how much will fatigue he
often experiences in the effort of "getting
down to business," most of all if the special
business on hand is hard or unattractive. You
stop and carefully scrutinize a fly as it crawls
zig-zag up the wall. You find yourself becom-
ing interested in a conversation that is going
on across the room. Then you decide to take
a few minutes off and smoke, thinking that it
will be easier after that-but it won't be and
you know it. Then you remember an impor-
tant note that ought to be got off at once. And
so it goes on.
