THE REALM OF CREDIT AND ITS
RULERS

BY

C. M. KEYS

[In this series of articles, M r. Keys, formerly one of the editors of The Wall Street Journal,
will simplify many of the mysteries of (nance, currency, and banking; introduce to the reader the
men who rule the banks; expose the ambitious schemes now being put into effect under the
National Bank Act; discuss and weigh, the state banks and the. trust companies; and lay bare
the glory and the shame of the savings banks. It is an attempt to make interesting and vital one
of the greatest public questions of the day, hitherto obscured from the eyes of the people by techni-

cality and dogma.--Tmi: EDITORS.]

" I might have converted my interests into gold at one
time and have taken my money to England! "
--Johet D. Rockefeller. quoted by the New York World.

OULD it be done? I asked that question
of several of the prominent financial
critics of the United States. They all

said, without hesitation, "No!" Then they
all took it back, that flat practical negative,
and began to theorize. At the end of the care-
ful syllogism, each reached the conclusion that
it could be done, but that in the doing of it the
fortune of the great experimenter would shrink
marvelously, and that the finance and industry
of the United States would be left a pitiful
wreck.

Practically, then, it is not to be feared that
any such attempt will be made. The strongest
argument against its practicability seems to
be that in the process it would be impossible
to keep from the knowledge of the banks the
fact that such an effort was under way, and that
the banks would act in concert to make it
impossible.

Yet, it could be done. Let us suppose that
a clique of great financiers, men of huge wealth,
retired from the most active pursuits, yet still
in business, had determined to teach the United
States a lesson. Let us imagine them piqued,
humiliated, angered beyond measure by the
attitude of the Executive, harassed by the labor
unions, goaded by popular baiting and news-
paper obloquy into a frame of mind conducive
to hatred and malice. We shall suppose that,

together, they command properties and secur-
ities that are worth in the markets to-day a
billion dollars. It will include real estate, and
stocks and bonds of all classes.

Let us imagine that there are five conspira-
tors, and that they have met together in a
magnificent private dining-room in New Von:
City. One, we shall say, is a great industrialist,
a maker of trusts, who has been bitterly assailed
by Government and people. Another is a
railroad magnate, whose lofty ambitions have
brought down upon his head the obloquy of
press and people. The third is a mighty
banker, one whose hand has always been ready
for re-organization, for promotion, for high
finance in all its phases. The hands of the
fourth are the hands of a laborer, for he has
worked his way from the forge and the mill to
a place near the top of the list of the kings of
Steel. The fifth is a Wall Street gambler,
yesterday poor and of little account; to-day
rich, a maker of markets, master of the art of
speculation. Each is a type. It is not the
intention of the writer to point to any particular
railroad man, or any particular banker. The
world of finance, in our day, has produced and
will continue to produce many who might fill
the roles. It would be diffcult, perhaps, to
find in the United States to-day a maker of
trusts, a great financial banker, a leader of
speculation who has no grievance, real or
fancied, against the Government, against labor,
or against the people. The conditions are
