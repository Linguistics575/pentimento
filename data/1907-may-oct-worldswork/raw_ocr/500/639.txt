TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

when an alien people comes under our control, we deem it
our duty to try the experiment of educating them to govern
themselves, and we should deem ourselves cowards and
recreants if we declined to accept the responsibility and
thus throw the people hack into a chaos of anarchy which
could not but result ultimately in self-destruction and

despotism."

Therefore, as a writer has already said in
this magazine, he held our national conscience
in his hands there in the Philippines. But it
was not enough that the Commission should
work for the good of the Filipino; it was neces-
sary also to make the Filipino believe it. Judge
Taft did that-and it was the most wonderful
thing he ever did.

The Commission toured the Archipelago,
investigated conditions by personal contact,
and measured every town and every province
for the kind of government that seemed best
for each. They had to deal with Christians
and Mohammedans and hill-tribe pagans--
all like whipped children, whimpering, sulking,
suspicious. These Asiatics believed that noth-
ing good could come out of the West, and
certainly the Western mind might never hope
to follow the tortuous slants of their Oriental
minds. But whether consciously or tlncon-.

intellect, but to the heart. The more the
natives sulked or smiled conciliation while they
fingered the locks of their guns, the more
earnest became the American judge in helping
them to help themselves.

His simple democracy was contagious. Na-

missioners followed his example. Laughter
worked better than epaulettes and oilicial
dignity. Here was a man without token
of rank, who lectured them "like a Dutch
uncle," slapped them on the back, went to
their fiestas and danced, a ruler who heartily
enjoyed himself and was not a pompous image
of condescension. Yet to laugh, to eat, to
dance, was to follow out his own broad and
high purposes of state.

Judge Taft won the Filipinos by genuine
kindness. He understood their grievances,
even the imaginary ones, which are the hardest
to appreciate or to remove; and he was abso-
lutely straightforward. He gained prestige by
his personality and also won their affection.
After that he could tell them flatly what to ex-
pect, and they believed him. As the herald of a
