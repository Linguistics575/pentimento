TRANSPLANTING A CITYâ€™S POOR

over and found positions-for the most part as
farm help-for some 7,000. In 1906, it did
as much for nearly 13,000. In the spring
months of the present year, it transplanted
more than 30,000. And the Transportation
Department states that, as a matter of course,
these figures will themselves seem small when
compared with what will be accomplished
in the five years to come.

First, as to the receiving end of the Trans-
portation Department. In the London head-
quarters is a staff of 100 ofhcers whose business
it is to see that assistance shall go only to those
who deserve it. There is no lack of material
to choose from. In 1906, when 13,000 were
taken, 112,000 asked to be "emigrated"; and
at the present time, applications are coming in
at the rate of 1,000-per day. But the applicant
must fill out certain blank forms, the sfate-
ments of which become the basis of a searching
investigation. The best evidence of this lies
in the fact that of a total of 20,000 so far
brought to Canada, only nineteen have proved
"undesirable," and these were deported at
the instance of the "Army" itself. Applicants
are not expected to be or to become tt Salvation-
ists." Catholics and Protestants are equally
welcome. The character of the individual
is the great consideration. After that, the
preference is given to the man with some farm-
ing experience. Married men are advised to
experiment upon themselves, and send later
for the wife and little ones.

In the London headquarters there is also a
complete bureau of information) Questions
are answered by word of mouth, by letter, and
through the columns of two new "Army"
periodicals-The Emigration Gazette and The
N ew Settler. The whole organization through-
out Canada supplies the information upon
which these answers are based. It is impressed
upon every would-be emigrant that there are
no poorhouses in Canada, and that he must
elect either to work or starve. The "Army"
will not allow itself to be made the means for
supplying "scab" labor in the. case of strikes
and lockouts.

Where the emigrant has money, he is "per-
sonally conducted." In the language of the
Transportation Department, he is "selected,
directed, protected''--) when settled in

ably. After advancing the cost of the passage
money and transportation to whatever Cana-.
dian centre to which a man may be "booked,"
the "Army" lends him from $5 to $15. The
unmarried man is expected to return the
amount within one year; the married man is
allowed three years. Of the money so ad-
vanced and which has come due to date, no
less than 95 per cent. has been refunded.

In the actual matter of transportation,
steamers are taken in their entirety wherever
possible. Three large liners were chartered
for the present year. In addition to this,
every individual unbooked passage on the
Canadian boats up to the end of June was
engaged. When the whole boat is taken, a
bureau of advice is opened on board. The
advice is apt to be homely and to the
point.

And here the "Army's" machinery has
shown itself astonishingly efficient. Using
the various Canadian headquarters as bases,
central farm help and information bureaus
have been established in St. John, Halifax,
Quebec, Montreal, Kingston, Toronto, London,
Winnipeg, Brandon, and Vancouver. Each
bureau makes it its business to keep a complete
list of all situations vacant in its territory.
In 1906, 60 per cent. of these emigrants were
taken before they could pass through Ontario.
There were situations offered for 1S,cKxr--or

. 2,000 more than were available.

Canada his welfare is "inspected." But he is '

not otherwise assisted. In the case of that
great majority of emigrants who are assisted,
the amount of the assistance varies consider,

In the case of young women emigrants,
a servants' hotel has been opened in Toronto.
From it as a distributing centre, much is being
done to-solve the great domestic problem in
Canada. And the province of Ontario, in
recognition of the fact that the "Army's"
emigrants "have cost the Government less,
man for man and woman for woman, and
proved more satisfactory than the emigrants
from any other source," has purchased a small
Toronto hotel where the family of an emigrant
brought over by the "Army" may stay while
the husband is establishing himself. In con-
nection with this, the various central bureaus
have been carrying on a campaign of education
to show the Canadian farmer that his wife
needs help no less than he does himself, and
that it will pay him in the end to take the
married emigrant, family and all. It means
that the farmer must build a tenant house,
but it has been shown to give a vastly more
permanent form of labor. Four years ago,
only 2 per cent. of the applications were for
