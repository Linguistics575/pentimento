immigrant. These will, within the next fifty
years, completely transform this region. As
it stands to-day, it has demonstrated enormous
possible riches. It may almost be said that
every man, particularly every white man, in
this whole region who has any qualities of
industrial leadership is building a fortune,
large or small, in proportion to his abilities and
in proportion to the transportation facilities
that he enjoys-and many of them are already
becoming men of very considerable fortunes.
On the Arkansas River there are. cotton planters
who live in palatial homes, and so of course
there are all the way down the Mississippi
Valley. When this region has the number of
railroads that its products will maintain, and
as dense a population even as the manufactur-
ing reg,ions of the upland South, not to speak
of the corn belt of the North Central States,
it will become a very rich region. The man
who digs ditches and the man who builds
railroads in this part of the United States are
the men who are the architects of a great agri-
cultural prosperity.

A very large part of the timber resources of
these states has been bought by great lumber
companies, some for immediate working and
others to hold for the future. 'But there could
hardly be a safer investment, nor could there
well be a better, than the purchase of
good farming lands, anywhere in this area.
Indeed, if there were some method whereby
a hundred thousand farmers could be directed
to these lands, as the opening up of new terri-
tory has frequently attracted them to such a,
region as Oklahoma, and if this hundred
thousand farmers had money enough to
drain their land and to clear it and no
more, and if they would devote the same
skill and the same business methods to the
growth of cotton that is given to the culture of
wheat and corn in the North and Northwest,
they would be, within the decade, the most
prosperous farmers in America. Of course,
this prediction is made upon the assumption
either that they carried enough labor with
them to gather the crop or that a machine
should be invented to do this with less labor.

THE PASSING OF PRESENT PROBLEMS

When one takes a comprehensive view,
therefore, of this region, remembering that no
part of it will be unhealthful after it is drained
-remcmbering, too, that white men can then
live in this climate as long and work as hard as

A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

in southern Europe-it is a short-sighted view
which concerns itself overmuch with any
present educational or social or political or
hygienic problems that exist there. The one
thing needed and the one thing that is now
quickly inevitable is the opening of the country
to settlement. For the first time, these large
facts are now becoming known and economic
forces will soon open this land to settlement.

When the industrial history of the whole
United States comes to be written, it will be a
cause of wonder that lines of railroad were
built across deserts to mining camps long before
they were built through the richest agricultural
section of the continent. This, again, is a
result of old ignorance, both of the people
and of the land-the ignorance of people both
there and elsewhere. Every million that is
spent in planting and opening this region will
yield prodigious dividends in immigration, in
agriculture, in schools, in home building, in
the building of cities, in the awakening of
thought, as well as in the increased production
of cotton.

Iowa has a mile of railroad for every six
square miles of territory, and Kansas for every
nine square-miles. But Louisiana, Miss-
issippi, and Arkansas have yet only one mile of
railroad for every fourteen square miles of
richer land--a vast difference in facilities.

JACKSON, MISS.

A good example of the awakening of this
part of the South is the recent history of Jack-
son, Miss.

It was a straggling, ill-kept capital village
a dozen years ago, and its chief claim to ex-
istence, not to say distinction, was that the
old state-house stood there. There is now a

. new and very beautiful capitol and there is a

new town, the growth of which in prosperity
and beauty is nothing short of astonishing.
There was an unattractive, muddy road which
led from the station to the state-house ten years
ago. It is now a beautifully paved street,
with compact business houses, and residences
which show both prosperity and good taste.

The city has become a manufacturing place;
it has almost suddenly grown, from a mere
village, to have more than 31,000 inhabitants.
The enterprise of the business men is shown by
this fact-that it was they who made the first
movement to secure for the South a fair share
of the Government supplies needed in
Panama; and a business man of Jackson
