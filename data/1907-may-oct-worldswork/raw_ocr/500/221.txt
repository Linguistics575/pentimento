THE FREIGHT YARDS AT' NASHVILLE, TENN.

 

One hundred and twenty-seven freight trains a day are handled here

Mr. T. o. Sandy, of Burkeville (south of
Richmond), once offered his land for sale at
$4 an acre. He was a commercial traveler
then. Nobody would buy it and he decided
to turn farmer himself. The land that yielded
5 or 6 bushels of corn per acre now yields from
70 to 80 bushels. The 200 acres that he had
under cultivation last year brought him more
than $:i,coccr---chiefly from dairy products.

In Augusta County, Mr. James Craig bought,
ten years ago, a farm for $7,000 and sold last
year his apple crop from 30 acres for $14,000.

Everybody has heard of the single pippin tree
in Albemarble County whose yield has several
times sold for $100.

begin here and extend to Florida, or even of
the peanut crop.

But the popular educational enthusiasm in
the state is an even more noteworthy thing.
Out of another great volume of facts, Mr.
Robert Frazer has written down these:
