THE OLD AND THE NEW ON THE TOLUCA ROAD

comes from the United States. But the
building itself has all the charm of tradition.
As befits a people whose mother country is
Spain, the architecture is Arabic Gothic, and
an especially pure and graceful example. A
year ago the pioneer skyscraper and only
modern office building was erected in the
capital. It towers with stately effect in the
group plan. The National Theatre, at present
a skeleton chaos of steel, will be another; and
then there will be the Pantheon for the repose
of the illustrious dead, besides ten or twelve
more buildings of which the legislative palace,
surpassing anything of the kind in the south,
will form the centre. Even each suburb
is to have its share in this beautifying
scheme. An astronomical observatory al-
ready rises among the gardens of Tacubaya.
Santa Maria has a Geological Institute, and

Popotla will soon be the location of a meteoro-
logical observatory.

Attractive homes, however, guarantee a
city's beauty more than public buildings.
The broad avenues of Mexico City are lined
with them now. The American has appeared
here with his pet institution, the real estate
boom. He has plotted out swampy wastes
into colonias, paved the streets with asphalt,
and planted trees. You turn a corner, and
you leave gaudy stucco fronts and barred
windows behind, and are at once in a wealthy
neighborhood of modern American residences.
Only the peaked sombreros dodging luxurious
motor cars remind you that you are not in
Washington.

Ten years ago, for perhaps a solid mile of
street, there would be no echo of the carpenter's
hammer: to-day nearly every block is a din
