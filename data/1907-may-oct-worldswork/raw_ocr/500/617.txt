group was the result. The park at Portland
rises steep from the sea and it was hvrv, "to
h art’s desire," that thc sculptor placed "The
Coming of the White Man.'' Several smaller
replicas of Multonomah have since been made
for private individuals.

“The Sun-Vow" is another fine represcnta-
tion of essential idealism. All that the older
man has aspired to be, all that he has revercnced,
all that he still aspires to and rcvcrcs arc 'citlg-
gested in his attitude as he sits patient at the
task of teaching his grandson to aim high.
This group was purchased, while on exhibition
at the Art Institute of Chicago, by Mr. Howard
Shaw, an architect of that city, and now stands
Upon his lawn at Lake Forest, Ill. A replica
