THE SOUTH AS A FIELD FOR INVESTMENT

Roughly speaking, the security behind a
bond depends upon the amount of net earnings
available to pay the interest on the bond. It
may be noted in the table that the "charges"
on the Southern roads are but 55% of the net
earnings, while on the New England and
Middle-Western roads they are 62% and on
the Southwestern they are 72%.

The fact of the matter seems to be not so
much that the bonds of the Southern com-
panies are badly secured, judged in this way,
as that the general impression gained from a
study of the roads is that they are weak in their
power to earn money. With the exception
of the Louisville & Nashville and the Norfolk
& Western, there are no large systems in the
South that earn $3,000 per mile, net. Almost
every road of importance in the East and in
the Middle West earns more than this.

If the general run of Southern bonds be safe,
then here are more bargains than in any other
section of the Union. If they be not safe, then
here is a great danger to be avoided.

Using the statistics as a basis, the verdict is
favorable. Going on from this point, the
favorable impression strengthens. The real
influence against these bonds has been, un-
doubtedly, the slow, reluctant, hesitating
growth of the Southern States. But to-day,
the growth is not slow nor hesitating. There
have been years of uncertainty, years when
it looked as though every road in the South
was born to bankruptcy-but those years seem
past, as the story of the South unfolds to-day.

In the narrow field of Southern railroad
bonds, generally speaking, it is safe to invest.
No bond that is a first-mortgage on a road in
Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Carolinas,
or Virginia need be questioned, provided the
road is already built.

In special classes of bonds, we should select
terminal issues in the great cities, in preference
to any of the bonds of the South. The rail-
road centres are well-defined, and no hesitation
need be felt about legally-drawn bonds on
terminals in Baltimore, Birmingham, Atlanta,
Richmond, New Orleans, Nashville, Chatta-
nooga, Charleston, or any other central dis-
tributing city of the South.

Railroad stocks are quite another matter.
There are few such stocks in the South that can
be classed. as really high-class for the average
investor who must have a definite certainty
of dividends. Norfolk & Western preferred,
Louisville & Nashville, Atlantic Coast Line,

Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis are good
stocks, but the very prosperity that lies upon
the roads is more or less of a threat to the
dividends. It looks to-day as though the
Louisville & Nashville must be considered a
safe, conservative 7% stock; but even so, it
is not beyond speculative influences.

The municipal bonds of the South yield
larger revenue than similar bonds in most other
regions of the country. They should be
bought with the nicest discrimination. Such
of them as come to New York are carefully
examined by the bankers, and there are un-
doubtedly some bargains among them. They
should be bought only through thoroughly
reputable and high-grade bankers, who have
the proper machinery for testing them before
they are offered.

Many hundreds of millions of dollars have
been poured into the South in the past five
years to finance coal mines, iron mills, chemical
companies, and other industrial enterprises.
A very large part of this expenditure is now
paying a good return on the investment. Quite
lately there has been a tendency to re-finance
a lot of these enterprises, watering them freely
and selling the new stocks and bonds to the
public. This tendency is likely to resume at
the next period of great Wall Street activity.

The public at large should not be tempted
into these enterprises. If a business man cares
to invest his money in Southern enterprise,
the field is a good, legitimate, and highly re-
munerative one. It is not, however, a field into
which the average non-resident investor can
afford to put his money.

Industrial companies that have been formed
at a distance to exploit enterprises in the South
are-as a rule-likely to be on a speculative
basis; and their stocks and bonds, however
alluring, ought to be bought with exceeding
care. Many of these companies are Over-.
capitalized and some of them have the dis-
advantage of non-resident control and man-
agement. These afford, as a rule, the kind
of investments that only the daring or the
exceedingly well-informed ought to indulge in.

But the South affords a rich field for invest-
ment by men who go with their money and
themselves manage the industries that they
invest in. In a word, it is a region for the
working investor; and, if the business or
enterprise be well-chosen and well-managed,
money will double itself there in a little while.
