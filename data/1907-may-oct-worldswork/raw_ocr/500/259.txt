 

THE SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE

affairs generally reach a point where the menace
outweighs the promised benefit, and capital
learns its lesson quickly.

JAPAN AND THE PEACE OF THE WORLD

ENERAL KUROKI was received in the
United States everywhere with real
admiration as well as with pardonable curiosity;
and everywhere he went he called forth ex-
pressions of friendliness to himself and to his
country. For instance, the formation of a
Japan Society in New York, a club to preserve
and to encourage the most friendly relations
between the two countries, was a graceful
indication of eordiality.

But the visit of this distinguished Japanese
General and of the naval officers who made us
a brief visit has set going much diplomatic
speculation about the part that Japan will
play in world-politics. The friendly com-
pacts between England and Japan and France
and Japan; the probability of Japan's building
up an influence in South America by immigra-
tion and by trade; the pressure of Japanese
immigration eastward to the Philippines, the
Hawaiian Islands, and the United States; the
part that Japan may play in the development
of China-those and such subjects have come
up for renewed discussion and speculation
throughout the whole Western world.

In spite of the absurdity of the talk that was
heard months ago about the danger of a
breach of friendly relations between the United
States and Japan because of the San Francisco
school incident, expressions of remote apprehen-
sion still crop out here and there. We arc
reminded that the inevitable race-feeling would
assert itself if Japanese immigration were to
become great; we are reminded that, as the
Japanese discovered that they were taken
seriously by the world as soon as they showed
good warlike qualities, they may conclude that
another war in due time--when they can afford
to pay for it-would increase their prestige
still more, and that the stronger the nation with
whom they fight, the greater the glory would
be. We are reminded, too, that their indus-
trial development may be an annoyance to our
trade-interests.

In every one of these apprehensions that
find expression, now here and now there, there
may be both a logical error and a misinterpreta-
tion of popular feeling on both sides; for there
are a hundred good reasons why the future
should have nothing but peace, to every sound

reason why it should have war in store for us.
But it is well for thoughtful men to remember
that there is in these days of a closely-knit
world only one very serious danger of war
between civilized nations; and that is the
growth of an inflamed public opinion or prej-'
udiee in one nation against another. Kings
and other rulers are becoming increasingly"
powerless to cause war, even when they are
so inclined. Grievances and open offences,
if they arc definite, are usually settled and
removed by diplomacy so long as public
opinion is quiescent. .But danger lurks chiefly
in the moods and prejudices of the people.
The thing of prime importance to the future
of Japan (and for that matter of the United
States also) is that the people shall not receive
wrong notions about international prestige
or about the character and purposes of other
races. For this reason, it is probably true that
the most dangerous influence in the world to-
day, in every nation, is the "yellow" press,
because it never makes for calmness but always
for popular excitement.

But happily General Kuroki's visit has
called forth in all the Western countries the
friendliest expressions to Japan; and, if there
be real danger to the peace of the world in
Japanese ambition, or in any possible opposi-
tion to Japan's legitimate development, it is
a danger that lies far in the future.

THE SECOND HAGUE CONFERENCE

p-- HE second Hague Conference of repre-

sentatives of all the chief Powers finds
the world in a very different mood from the
mood that prevailed when the first Conference
met. Then any concerted movement looking
toward the prevention of war was regarded as
an impracticable dream.

The Tribunal created by the Conference was
regarded as an impractical and academic thing.
But it has settled international differences,
and the practicability of arbitration has steadily
won its way in the minds of men and of nations.
It is true that there have been two great wars
in recent years-the Boer war and the Japan-
ese war with Russia; but the agitation for
the peaceful settlement of international dif-
ferences has nevertheless made unexpected
and most remarkable progress.

Such events as the growth of the Inter-
parliamentary Union, the great Peace Con-
ference recently held in New York, the widen-
ing influence of the annual conferences for
