colored. The whole public school system
here is built upon an ideal of industrial service;
and cooking, dressmaking, home-keeping, car-
pentering, foundry work, go hand in hand with
elementary and academic studies. The output
of industrial work done in the Negro schools
is especially promising. The Secondary Indus-
trial School is a free institution recently estab-
lished for boys and girls and offers (besides
studies in four academic branches) practical
instruction in carpentry, pattern-making, forge
and foundry work, machine work, textiles,
millinery, dress-making, domestic science, and
commercial training.

THE CONTRADICTION OF ALL THEORIES

To set down a few specific illustrative facts
out of a wealth of such facts-this is a weary and
inadequate way to tell the transformation that
industry is making in the lowland South, a
transformation not only in the fortunes of the
people but in their point of view and in their
outlook.

But, on the other hand, to draw sweeping
conclusions is likely to give a wrong notion,
for fortunes cannot be picked up, and there
is no such thing as a sudden change in the
thought or in the habits of any people. To
describe the new impulse, the new opportunities,
the overcoming of old difficulties, the operations
of new economic forces, the changed angle of
vision-that is a hard task. This magazine is
not given to "booming" anything. Exaggera-
tion defeats its own purpose. Yet to write
with less than enthusiasm would be to write
less than the truth. The following incidents
indicate a few of the kinds of changes.

I asked a young man at one of the Southern
schools of technology why he chose this train-
ing rather than training for one of the older
professions. "My grandfather," said he, " was
a mighty man in theology in his day. He
knocked out his opponents and he battered the
devil. My father was a lawyer and a soldier.
He fought the United States by argument
and in war. I notice that the devil and the
United States are both doing business yet.
I made up my mind, therefore, that I would
change the family job and do what I can to
build mills and roads in Georgia."

I saw a record of the transfers of a tract of
land in the outskirts of Memphis which had
increased in value, within about twenty years,
from $500 to $45,000; and such an experience
can be found in any of these larger cities.

THE SOUTHERN STATES

Nobody in Memphis or anywhere else believed
this possible. Of course, such a fact means a
new adjustment of man to the land-a new
adjustment to life.

Less than twenty-five years ago the principal
taxpayers in Durham, N. C.,. protested in
writing against the levying of a local tax for
schools. They didn't believe in "free schools,"
nor in being taxed to educate other people's
children. These same men built, not many
years later, by their private subscriptions as
well as by their taxes, large and beautiful
schoolhouses for Negro children as well as for
white children; and they now properly boast
of their schools.

I recall a speech that I heard a man of learn-
ing make ten years ago to prove that the Negro
could not accumulate or_manage property.
There are to-day eleven banks owned and
managed by Negroes in Mississippi-in Miss-
issippi, mind you.

Another instance: Two men, whose parents
were "poor white trash," have, without formal
education, in ten or a dozen years made
property worth $2oo,cxxr---by growing cotton;
and they manage their business as systemati-
cally as any business in New York is managed.

I know a young man who declined a com-.
fortable salary and a post of honor in a North-
ern university because he wished to teach
country youth at his own Southern college on
an insecure guarantee (year by year) of only
$500. There are hundreds such.

I know a little Southern railroad that was
built through a pine forest to haul lumber.
What would become of it when the lumber
was exhausted? Its freight receipts now from
small manufactured wood-products are greater
than they ever were from lumber.

Similar experiences maybe found in any
rapidly developing part of the country. But
the point is, you have always expected such
things to happen in the West. Now these
very things are happening in the lower South--
things that contradict every old theory, North-
ern or Southern.

This era of change brings us, therefore, to
this happy conclusion-many of the trouble-
some problems of to-day will not be troublesome
problems to-morrow. The "problem" stage
of Southern life is passing. The theoretical
stage is passing. The industrial era is bringing
natural forces into activity. This is true, of
course, in varying degrees in different places.
But the change has begun, and only time is
