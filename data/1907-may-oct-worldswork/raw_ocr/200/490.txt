the applicant, and the necessity "of getting
high interest returns out of the investment.

To the man or woman who has saved $500
by dint of long self-sacrifice, the reply is almost
invariable. It is to leave the money in the
savings bank, provided the bank is organized
under strong protective laws. To the New
York or Massachusetts saver this advice is al-
ways given. To the depositors in the so-
called savings banks in some other states
we think it a kindness to suggest that they
take the money out of the banks and put
it into the bonds of such a company as the
Pennsylvania Railroad, or into strong
municipal bonds. This article is not the
proper place to discuss in full the laws of the
various states.

Turning to the wider class of savers who are
thinking of investment, the class that holds
from $1,000 to $I,500 cash, earning from the
savings banks an average of perhaps 33s per
cent., the question becomes more difficult.
This is the class of people that falls an easy prey
to the promoter and the swindler. In reality,
such an individual should either leave the
money in bank, or else invest it only in a most
conservative way; but it is astounding how
large a percentage of such people will risk half
or three-quartcrs of this fund in some mining
stock, some great invention, or some iridescent
dream of a promoter.

In answering such queries, this magazine
allows itself some latitude. If the saver is a
man on a good salary, pretty well established
and not likely to worry over things, it is pos-
sible to go so far as to advise the purchase of a
few shares of a standard stock, either railroad
or industrial. This has been the case in partic-
cular this last spring. A small amount of
Union Pacific preferred or common, of Great
Northern preferred, Northern Pacific, New
York Central, or General Electric at the prices
obtaining through the spring and early summer,
has not seemed to us amiss for such an investor.
The returns are large, and the ultimate values
behind the stocks are plain enough for any man
to see.

. 1f the query comes from a woman teaching
school, saving a pittance from stenography, or
saving her pennies from a shop-girl's pay, the
answer is very generally to keep the account
in the savings bank, unless the savings bank is
in a state where an investment would be safer,
or at least as safe. In a case like this last, the
advice often is to buy bonds.

INVESTING A SAVINGS BANK FUND

Let us assume, for instance, the case of a
woman schoolteacher who has saved $1,000
and has it in savings banks paying her 3 per
cent., under laws that do not make the savings
bank absolutely secure. Various replies have
been given to such queries as this. One in-
vestment that has been suggested more than
once is as follows:

2 Bonds, 3500 each, Pennsylvania convertible 3l%,

 

due on Nov. 1, 1912, selling at 94 . $940
Left in bank _ . _ _ . . _ _ . _ . . 60
Total . . . . . . . _ _ $1,000

The price is the quotation ruling at the time
this article is written. It may vary, either way,
before the article is printed. A commission
to the banker is included in it. This is very
small-about $1.25.

Examining such a transaction, the points of
advantage will become clear. In the savings
bank, the annual interest is $30. From the
bonds, the annual interest is $35, paid in two
instalments on November Ist and May Ist.
Supposing that the bonds are held until they
come due, on November 1, 1912, and are then
cashed, the proceeds are as follows:

From principal $1,000.00
From interest (simple) 192.50
Total . . . . _ _ _ $1,192.50
Add amount left in bank. . . _ 6o.oo
Simple interest at 3% 9.00
Total . . . . . . . $1,261.50
Amount ifleft in bank, with simple interest at 3% 1,150.00
Profit through investment _ . . _ _ $111.50

If anyone cares to work out the difference
at compound interest, reckoned in the case of
the bonds by depositing the $17.50 interest on
each November Ist and May Ist to draw 3
per cent. interest in the savings bank, it is not
difficult to do so.

No one in the United States expects that the
Pennsylvania Railroad will fail to pay these
interest instalments when they fall due, or to
pay the principal in 1912. It follows that the
investment is to all intents and purposes
absolutely safe. Dozens of other investments
equally safe may be selected. This particular
bond is here used merely because it has seemed
good to recommend it from time to time to
individual enquirers, and because no question
of safety is likely to arise against it in the mind
of any critic.
