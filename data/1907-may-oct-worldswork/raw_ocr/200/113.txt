 

GOVERNOR HUGHES-NOW AND LATER

AN EXECUTIVE WITHOUT A "MACHINE"

BY

" Q. P."

ORE surprising political events might
M happen than that Governor Hughes
l should receive the next Republican
Presidential nomination-not as the Roosevelt
candidate but as the only man who could
defeat the Roosevelt candidate in convention
and then stand a reasonable chance of election.
If any thing can induce Mr. Roosevelt to
reconsider his determination not to run again,
it will be the political situation in his own
state. For while Mr. Roosevelt is not only
willing but anxious to conclude his executive
responsibilities with his present term, it is
certain that he does not regard that as the
end of his political career. Having done what
he could in administrative office, he natur-
ally desires to turn over that work to a sym-
pathetic and harmonious successor.

The voting population of the United States
is with Mr. Roosevelt. The people believe
in his sincerity, his purpose to do what is right,
his "square-deal" policy. Whatever he favors
the public will clamorously support. He is
their champion against "Standard Oil," the
beef-packers, the railroads, Wall Street, and all
the other ogres. On Mr. Roosevelt's strength
and popularity with the people none puts
a higher estimate than the "high financiers"
themselves. Mr. Morgan, Mr. Harriman, Mr.
Rogers, Mr. Ryan, Mr.Armour, and the rest of
them are so convinced of their inability to stem
Mr. Rooseveltâ€™s popularity that their prayers
for clemency are now addressed directly
to him. While they and the Senators
and the other political bosses of their circle,
if they thought they could, would seek
to nominate and to elect Mr. Fairbanks or
Speaker Cannon, their fear of Mr. Roosevelt's
strength with the people is so great that the
only way they see to escape him is to take some
other man in whom the people have great
confidence, No other man who answers this
description is available except Governor
Hughes.

Mr. Hughes never had anything to do with
politics before his nomination last fall. And
according to Albany reports, his abstinence
continues. For twenty years he had alternated
in occupation between a law office and law-
school professorships. In both he was secluded.
As a lawyer, his partners did the trial mark and
he was the office counsel. A great part of his
modest income came from giving advice to
other lawyers. He was a man of infinite
patience and detail, an expert on contracts
and involved agreements. His first appearance
in public was as chairman of the legislative
Gas Committee three years ago. Senator
Frederick C. Stevens was chairman of that
committee. Mr. Stevens had been in the gas
business himself. He was a banker in Washing-
ton and a gentleman farmer in Wyoming
County, N. Y, where his father and grand-
father lived and where he returned to go into
politics and raise fancy cattle. Senator Stevens
knew Mr. Hughes as the kind of a lawyer he
would personally employ. Instead of hiring
a legal star or a political lawyer, the committee
took Mr. Hughes.

PROBING THE GAS COMPANIES

The gas companies were investigated as
never before. Instead of oratorical display
and calling as witnesses the men who really
controlled the gas monopoly and prying into
their political relations and private monetary
affairs, Mr. Hughes stuck to gas. He first
went into the franchises of the companies, not
the manner in which they had been obtained
but solely their present legal value and existence.
He disclosed flaws in many franchises. He
proved the expiration of the original franchises.
He brought out that the consolidation into one
monopoly was illegal and could be readily
upset in the courts. Then he went into the
question of actual investment of real money
which the capitalization of more than
$200,000,000 represented. He proved that
