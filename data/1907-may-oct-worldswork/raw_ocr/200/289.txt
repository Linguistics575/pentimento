A LIGHTHOUSE

bowsprit, there was not sufficient crew to haul
off the hawser of the life-line, and the line
soon parted.

"The night was horribly cold, with three
men on the fore crosstrees and the captain on
the cap of the bowsprit, with the sea washing
over him. Soon after dark, the crew aloft
heard the captain say: 'My eyes are now
freezing, I am growing blind. Oh, my poor
children!' His hands and feet had been me
viously frozen and he was probably washed off
some time during the night, for he was missing
in the morning and his body was never found.

"There were three left on the wreck. Two
were rescued by a tug the next morning and
the other was left frozen in the crosstrees. I
arrived on the scene shortly after the tug had
rescued the two men, and from where I stood
I could see my townsman frozen in the
crosstrees. This had a depressing effect on
me, as it was a vessel which I had personally
built and sent to sea. I could not but feel at
the time that I was the murderer of those two
townsmen and I made up my mind to try and
atone for this terrible calamity by helping to
prevent recurrences of such disasters by estab-
lishing lighthouses on unmarked dangers.

"I believe that can be called my first act or
thought that might be in answer to the letter
asking for 'good faith.'

"That night I was left alone in a cold hotel;
during the night 1 formed a resolution to make
an effort of this kind. That led to my subse-
quent invention of the lighthouse which I have
worked so many years to get through Congress.
I also had in mind my own terrible experience
on my last vogage south in 1881, in this same
schooner J. R. Eells, of which I was then
master and which I sailed from New York
loaded with railroad-iron bound for Palatka.

"Everything went well until we reached
Hatteras. It was night and I wished to be on
the safe side; when by log I had run far enough
to haul to-that is, to turn the corner-l thought
the tide might have run stronger than I
supposed, so I stood further off and was caught
by the Gulf Stream, which made the water so
rough that I could not carry sail. In conse-
quence, we were blown to sea and did not get
back again for thirteen days; and when at
last I saw land again, I was still north of but
in sight of Hatteras. Again I tried to round
the Cape and under very much the same cir-
cumstances, but with no better success. My
vessel was new and strong, as it was built the

preceding year, but the sails gave out and the
oil was spilled and we were in darkness-with
not even a light in the binnacle to see the com-
pass-and our provisions were getting short.
Four times we were blown off and four times we
made Hatteras on the wrong side; in despera-
tion, I made up my mind to hold to the land the
next time and we went in around the shoals in
ten fathoms, but with a vow that if we did
strike the sands I would use every effort to
place a light on this dreaded shoal. I was then
supplied with oil and provisions from the
Fryingpan Lightship, but could get no canvas
to repair my sails, so we proceeded to George-
town for repairs. While crossing over the
bars with a pilot on board, our vessel struck
on the sand for want of suincicnt sail, injuring
the hull, and we had to be towed to Charleston
for repairs; there my bill for repairs was nearly
$4,000. Two other vessels that were in com-
pany with us during that terrible time off
Hatteras were never heard from again.

"On my return to New York, I went to
Staten Island, to the Lighthouse Department,
and talked with the man in charge; perhaps
I should say that this was really my first act of
good faith in reference to the lighthouse off the
bars on the Diamond Shoals.

"The southeastern point on the coast of
North Carolina forms Cape Hatteras; ten miles
at sea is Hatteras Shoals, on which the seas of
the Atlantic break and on which many known
and unknown wrecks have occurred. The
sands in some locations shift at every gale.
Sweeping round in close contact with the shoals
runs the Gulf Stream, setting to the northeast,
laden with storms and squalls and lashed by
the very hell of the ocean. Here is a narrow
channel, then, with a dangerous shoal on one
side and this raging river of the ocean on the
other. Many south-bound sailing vessels, with
the prevailing westerly wind, are forced into
and caught by the Gulf Stream in an effort to
round the Cape to avoid the shoal and are
swept back and often blown broad off the land,
perhaps to return in a crippled condition after
weeks of hardships and suffering, or else
obliged to abandon a worthless and dangerous
wreck to be left in the path of vessels-if they
do not go down with an exhausted and helpless
crew to the silent bed of the ocean. This
shoal is situated in the direct course of vessels
bound for the Southern ports of the United
States, and is passed by nearly all the south-
bound vessels from our Northern ports. I
