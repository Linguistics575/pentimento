were established in different parts of Ohio in
the period before the war. Most of these
communities have disappeared and been for..
gotten, but traces of them may still be found
under obscure names in forgotten corners of
Ohio, and in other portions of the original
Northwest Territory. More than one of the
families now living in Wilberforce can trace
its history back to some one of the Negro
pioneers who crossed the mountains from
Virginia in the early days in order to fu1d a
home in the free territory of the Northwest.

The conditions under which this and the
other Negro communities of which it is a type
were established in Ohio will be better under,
stood, perhaps, if I recall the circumstances
under which the state was settled.

A century ago one might have discovered in
Ohio a situation not unlike that which may be
seen to-day in the new state of Oklahoma.
Two currents of immigration, one from the
North, the other from the South, pouring into
the state and mingling on the same soil, brought
into touch with one another two widely dif-
ferent traditions, particularly with regard to
the Negro and the treatment that he deserved
at the hands of his white neighbors. The
effect of this was to produce a number of
abrupt changes in the situation of the free
Negroes, according as, in the course of history,
the anti-slavery or the prorslavery element had
control of popular opinion. For instance, by
the terms of the Constitution, as it was first
adopted by the constitutional convention in
1802, Negroes were given the right to vote.
A motion subsequently made to strike out the
provision was carried only by the vote of the
presiding olhccr. This was followed, however,
a few years later, by the enactment by the
Legislature of a so-called "black code," so
vigorous in its terms that, if it had been en-
forced, it would have made the position of the
free Negroes of Ohio quite as diificult as it
ever was in any of the slave states. Laws
were passed which were intended not merely
to prevent the further settling of Negroes in
the state, but which aimed to drive out those
already there.

One thing about the character of the people
who settled the southern part of Ohio was
peculiar. Though most of the settlers in the
two or three tiers of counties were from Vir-
ginia or Kentucky, a large number were people
who had moved from the South for the pur-
pose of freeing their slaves. Mount Pleasant,

NEGRO COLLEGE TOWN

Smithfield, and several other neighboring
towns in Jefferson County were settled by
Quakers who had liberated their slaves in
North Carolina and after the adoption of the
ordinance in 1787 settled in the free territory.
It was at Mount Pleasant that Benjamin
Lundy, the founder of the Abolition move-
ment, started the first Abolition paper, in
1821.

But not merely Quakers and those of severe
and earnest religious views migrated to the new
country to secure freedom for their slaves.
Some of the men who were most prominent
in the early history of the state were drawn to
this new country for the same reason.

Thus, from earliest times, it had become a
custom for masters who did not believe in the
institution of slavery, or who, for any reason
whatever, wished to free their slaves, either to
emigrate to the free territory or send their
slaves there to enjoy the fruits of freedom.
This practice of settling emancipated slaves
on the free soil of the Northwest Territory
was continued until the Civil War put an end
to slavery.

The little Negro community at Tawawa
Springs-now known as Wilberiorce-was
Southern in its origin, and the school out of
which the present College eventually grew was
an attempt to redress some of the wrongs that
sprang from slavery.

THE FOUNDING OF THE COLLEGE

In 1856, when the anti-slavery agitation was
at its height in Ohio, the Methodist Conference
in Cincinnati, in conjunction with the Con-
ference of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, established at Tawawa Springs a
school for the Negro immigrants and refugees
who had settled there. Salmon P. Chase, the
first anti-slavery Governor of Ohio, was one of
the board of trustees. Governor Chase's
interest in the school continued throughout his
life, and when he died, as Chief-Justice of the
United States, he left $10,000 to assist in pro-
viding an endowment for the institution.

At the time of the breaking out of the war,
this school had nearly one hundred pupils.
Many of these came from the families settled
in the neighborhood. Others were the natural
sons and daughters of Southern planters who
had sent them North to be educated. But with
the breaking out of the war the school, de-
prived'of its principal patrons, fell into decay,
and in June, 1863, it was sold for a debt of
