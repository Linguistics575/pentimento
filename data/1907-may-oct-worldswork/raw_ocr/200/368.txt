pr66 THE
tion companies in the State of New York.
These two commissions took over the authority
and the duties vested for years in the Rapid
Transit Commission, the State Railroad Com-
mission, the Gas and Electricity Commission,
and the State Inspectors of Water Meters, and
various new duties besides imposed under
the act which brought these new commissions
into being.

No man can say in advance whether they
can successfully do the thousand tasks that
must arise in a state as big and populous as
New York. Of course, similar commissions
have done well in other states, and even more
strikingly in other countries-but New York is
New York, and no other place. Besides, the
powers of these commissions are more sweep-
ing than the powers, we believe, given to
similar bodies in any other state.

It is within the power of the commissioners
to control the making of railroad rates, the pro-
vision of adequate car-supply, both on railroads
and street-railways, the distribution of cars to
shippers, the giving of free or reduced-rate
transportation, the issue of stocks and bonds,
the purchase or lease of one corporation by
another, the issue and capitalization of fran,
chises, and the consolidation, in any form
whatever, of companies that come under the
Public Utilities Act. Telephone and telegraph
companies alone are excepted from the author-
ity and control of the commissioners.

The men in whom are vested these remark-
able powers are not widely known men. Mr.
William R. Willcox, the Chairman of the New
York City Commission, has gained an hon-
orable public reputation as postmaster of
New York City. Mr. Frank W. Stevens, the
chairman of the State Commission, is little
known in public life, and is known not at all
to the political world. In fact, the members
of the commissions, chosen directly by Gov-
ernor Hughes, are singularly free from political
trammels. The whole body is strictly non-
political. Of the ten members, but one, Mr.
James E. Saguc, is a practical railroad
man. There is not a traction expert, a gas
expert, nor an engineer on the board. The
Governor appears to have gone on the safe
assumption that, if he selected honest and
faithful commissioners, they could hire all
necessary expert advice. The public at large
will probably agree with Governor Hughes
that the first requisites are honesty and willing-
ness to work overtime.

MARCH OF EVENTS

For the task is one that will require the most
painstaking labor. There will be no holidays
for these commissions, and their way will be
beset with many pitfalls. Already one branch
of the newspaper press is calling upon them
immediately to undertake a prosecution of
certain capitalists. Criticism will be the
daily fare of the commissioners. It is well
that so many of them are lawyers, for it will
require the nicest discrimination and the most
imperturbable composure to choose the right
path in the control of the administration of
these great companies, particularly of those
in New York City.

So long as Mr. Hughes is Governor, the Poli-
cies, the initiative and the results of these com-
missions will be based upon the nicest legal
judgment, the fairest interpretation of the
laws, and the same spirit of courageous fair
play that prorated his veto of the two-cent
bill in the s? of the country-wide agitation
against the xailroads and the hysteria of a
large, if not particularly influential, part of
the press. lior this law is the great personal
triumph of the Governor-his contribution to
the most pressing and most vexing problem
of our time. And, if it work well under his
guidance, it will have made a long start toward
permanence.

 

VAST SUMS TO NEW FIELDS-AND THE RESULT

RANCE and England are two of the
richest nations in the world. New York
is one of the richest cities in the world.
Yet in the last week in June, British'consols
and F rench rentes, which are the representative
bonds of those two nations, fell to the lowest
prices in years. And in the same week the
City of New York offered for sale nearly thirty
million dollars of its four per cent. stock and
received bids for only two and a half millions.
In other words, this city is unable, at this time,
to sell its stocks even at a price the lowest in
its history,
What is the meaning of these events? No
tone believes that the English nation, at peace
with all the world and at the very crest of its
commercial greatness, is weaker to-day than
it was, for instance, in the second year of the
Boer War. Nor can any man say that France
is weakening, although it may be noted that
the income tax, recently laid, has struck a blow
at the popular habit of investing in the national
bonds. Certainly no New Yorker is willing
to admit that the bonds or stocks of the city are
