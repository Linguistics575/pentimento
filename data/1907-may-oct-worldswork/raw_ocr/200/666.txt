construction of the Manila electric railway
system have been retained and trained in the
shops, with the result that they will probably
be successfully used to repair cars and build
the bodies of such new rolling stock as may from
time to time be required. The Filipino is a
born carpenter; given a bolo and a pile of barn-
boo, he will in a few hours complete a house
or set of furniture that would do credit to a
well-trained artisan. In the use of machine
tools he is, of course, unskilled; but the ease
with which he learns is remarkable. Every
one of the hundred or more electric cars in
Manila is manned by Filipino motormen and
conductors. Taken as a whole, they are much
more tidy and attractive in appearance than
men holding similar positions in American
cities.

It is difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion
regarding the relative economy of laborers
of different nationalities. Certain it is that the
white man in that climate is but twrrthirds
as efficient as the ordinary white laborer in
America. The Chief Engineer of the Benguet
Road states that the average Filipino can do
only onc-fifth as much as a white man in
America, and that he has found a single Igorrote
to be worth three ordinary Filipinos. Arithmetic
leads us then to the inference that the average
Igorrote laborer can do practically as much
work in a day as an average white laborer in
the Philippines, and, of course, he receives
but one-half as much pay. The same authority
states that the American laborer in the Philip-
pines is unreliable although competent.

With the experience of the furst fwe years,
it is not to be wondered at that American
interests decided that it would be feasible to
construct a great railroad system in the Philip-
pines entirely with native labor. Of course,
not one in a thousand has any mental conception
of a steam railroad. Yet they understand that
it will give them a rapid and cheap means of
getting their produce to market and they appre-
ciate the fact that it will enable them to farm
on a larger scale.

THE NECESSITY FOR RAILROADS

Goods which now cost $40 a ton to transport
to the sea can be carried by the railroads for
a small fraction of that sum, and the producer
will therefore receive a greater return for his
labor in production.

During the dry season bullock carts can be
used in some sections of the islands. They

carry 600 pounds and cover fifteen miles a day,
making the cost of this transportation from
thirty-five cents to $1.50 a ton-mile. In some
sections, nine-tcnths of the transportation is
accomplished by Igorrote packers, the other
tenth by the aid of pack horses. At this busi-
ness of what might be called long-distance
express service, the Igorrote is a marvel. To
take fifty pounds from Candon to Cervantes,
forty-six miles, the round trip requires four to
six days; he receives one and a half pesos, or
seventy-five cents gold, and furnishes his own
rations. Transportation of this sort may cost
anywhere from $20 to $100 a ton. As a con-
trast to these high rates, it might be stated that
the charges of the Manila and Dagupan Rail-
road average $5 to $10 per ton for a hundred-
mile haul.

The railroads now under construction will
traverse tracts of uncultivated land, but the
desire to own and work plantations along the
railroads will undoubtedly become epidemic.
The near future will see a large percentage of
the population engaged in farming on a more
or less comprehensive scale. The Government
has provided against the inroads of foreign
corporations by limiting the area that can be
held by any one individual or corporation to
about 2,000 acres. This law, together with
the present low price of the land-hom $1 to $3
an acre-is in accord with the policy of "the
Philippines for the Filipino." Certainly the
more capable natives will ultimately come into
control of large haciendas, which will be worked
by their less fortunate fellows.

Philippine sugar will newer become a menace
to Cuban or local supply for the United States.
All that can be raised in the islands will find
a ready market at a good price in China. The
coastwise trade is largely in the hands of
Chinese merchants, and they have, in the past,
marketed the entire sugar crop of the islands.

Naturally the location of the trunk lines on
the various islands was made to conform to
the richest territory; the roads were planned
to extend from the more important sea-ports
through those parts of the island from which
the largest return in the way of freight and
passenger trafhc might be expected.

The density of population in the surveyed
districts is almost incredible, even when eon-
sidered'in the light of the most thickly settled
sections of the United States. For instance, the
average population of the island of Cebu is
350 persons per square mile, and a large portion
