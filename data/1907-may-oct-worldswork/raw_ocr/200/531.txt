The water drawn from the Gunnison River will here be delivered to nearly 130,000 acres of arid lands

From Luj:me over the mountain by road to
River Portal in the Gunnison car5on is twelve
miles-twie as far as through the tunnel.
Up the Uncompuhgre side the road winds, as
any other mountain road, but on the other slope
parts of it had to be blasted out of soil rock.
It is the only wagon road into the Lru"ion for
Seventy miles. The grade is so steep that the
four-horse wagons going over it present the
appearance of being almost all brakes. In
places it drops as much as 22 feet in a hundred.
Over this road is hauled, at $4.50 a ton, all the
machinery for the power house, the rails, wire,
motors, and cars for the tunnel, all the building
material and food supplies for the town, and

hundreds of tons of coal. Most of this hauling
must be done in the summer, for the top of the
divide is two or three feet deep in snow in winter.

At the bottom of the gorge, River Portal is
built partly on the dump from the tunnel and
partly on the side of the gorge where each house
has to have an embankmentmudcto give it
room to stand. The tunnel on this end has
gone through rock so solid that timbers have
been needed only in a few places. Some beds
of rock have been encountered which have
required from twelve to twenty hours for drill,
ing blast holes. On this side they tapped (Ln
underground stream with a volume of about
700,000 gallons a day.
