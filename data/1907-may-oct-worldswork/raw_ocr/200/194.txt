to progress; from a condition in which the
banks had to "run" the farmers to the con-
dition where the farmers "run" the banks.
The mills have meant $23,750,000 a year to
the county, in money. They mean much
more than this in human progress. There are
20,000 people in the mill village, most of whom
have been brought out of the loneliness of farm
life or the isolation of the mountains into touch
with progress. Mr. Arthur Shadwell, the
English economist, in his book entitled "In-
dustrial Ef5cicncy," says of the Southern mills:

"The conditions of life are by no means so bad as might
be inferred from the wages and the hours and absence of
factory laws. They are, in fact, better than in the more
'advanced' communities in the North. I have not said
anything about thecostoflivingin America. . . . but
the difference between North and South is so great "as to
more than counterbalance the difference in earnings. And
in regard to other external conditions, the advantage
lies equally with the South. Life is rural, not urban, in
these mill settlements: there is none of the squalor and
congestion of the town; the people live close to their work
amid surroundings which are often charming and some-
times ideal-veritable garden cities. Such a one is Pelzer
in South Carolina. It has a population of 7,000 to 8,000,
which has grown around the mills in 20 years. The
business was started in 1881, with one mill containing
10,000 spindles; there are now four containing [30,000
spindles and 3,600 looms, and giving employment to 3,000
hands.

"The people have good houses, for which they pays
shillings ($2) a month rent, churches of various denomin-
ations, schools, and stores, where they can buy every
necessity good and cheap. It is all set among fir trees
in very pretty country. No liquor is sold in the place.
These people are not badly off or discontented; they have
Â£20,000 ($00,000) in the savings bank and get 4 per cent.
on it. I nowhere found any local feeling against the mills
which have brought work and wages."

This is a more favorable report of the lives of
the operatives than most of the mill men give.
In many places the operatives do not live well.
But they live better than they did in the mar
row isolation of their mountain homes; and
the opportunity for further improvement is
more valuable than the progress already made.

"Thirty years ago," said an old resident of
Spartanburg, "our people knew how to raise
money on farm property and they could put
a chattel mortgage on a bull, and that is about
all they knew about brokerage." Last year
a broker made $30,000 dealing in real estate
and stocks and bonds. When that man came
to Spartanburg eight years ago, he had never
seen a draft. The money he used in doing

THE COTTON MILLS AND THE PEOPLE

this was part of the $23,750,000 yearly in-
creased income which the mills have brought
to Spartanburg County. The $1,000,000 of
capital and surplus and the $2,000,000 of
deposits of the Spartanburg banks are chiefly
due to the increased prosperity brought by the
mills.

This is how the smokestacks have made
Spartanburg. And Spartanburg is but one
place in many. The Piedmont country from
Virginia to Alabama is being transformed.

In 1850 there died in Spartanburg an old
bachelor who preached on Sundays and who,
by trading the other six days in the week, had
made a fortune and gained a reputation for
parsimony among his more easy-going neigh-
bars. Thus, the Rev. Benjamin Wofford left
$100,000 to found a college. For the last
fifty years, the dominant figure at the college
has been Dr. James H. Carlisle. Without
either money or political power, this old man,
by the strength of his character, has kept
education in its broadest sense alive, even in
the extreme poverty of the people just after
the war, and has saved it from being swamped
by the successful commercialism of the present
time. I heard one man ask another what he
had studied under Dr. Carlisle. "Astronomy,"
was the answer. "Did you learn any thing?"
the first one asked. "Yes," answered the
other, "I learned to be a man." A Texas
ranchman who had studied under Dr. Carlisle
told a friend from home that he had tried to go
to the devil for ten years and the D0ctor's
iorefinger had kept him straight; and he
wanted his friend when he got back to tell the
Doctor what a h-l of a man he was.

There is no commercial standard in which
the influence of Dr. Carlisle and of Wofford
College can be measured. While I was in
Spartanburg at the hotel, there was a man
there who was trying to hire a house. He had
moved his family from an adjoining county
while his son should go to college. The presi-
dent of Wofford told me of another man who
had sold his business in Richland and moved
to Spartanburg for the same reason. Many
graduates of Wolford, who come from other
parts of South Carolina and from other states,
settle in Spartanburg. Almost all the bank
presidents, their assistants, and many of the
cotton-mill men and merchants in the town are
Wofford graduates. Not one of these men
ever heard street-paving mentioned in a class-
room. Yet the good streets of Spartanburg
