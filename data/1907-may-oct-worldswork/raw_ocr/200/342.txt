9140 TAFT:
inspired the sobriquet of "Lubber," but heavy
bodies are capable of much momentum.
One early observed that there was no inertia
about slow-plodding "Lub" Taft. His solemn
earnestness was steam, was power, and his
curiosity was a most indefatigable stokcr.
With self-mockery beaming in his eyes, though
with a certain quaint gravity, he used to an-
nounce that he had decided to be President
when the slight obstacle of few years was once
remedied.

One morning in school he raised his hand
eagerly; the teacher recognized the hand, and
the chubby little "buster" of eleven had the
floor.

"The imperial yak," he announced, "has
gone through the Canal!"

He meant "yacht," the first vessel to pass
through Suez. And now he is digging a canal
himself, between two other continents. T

That imperial "Yak," however, does indicate
how keenly sensitive he was to history in the
making. As for history ready-made, he pored
over it voraciously. One does not, however,
gather the idea that he was a bookworm. A
man, who as a boy lived next door, recalls him
curled up into a ball on the window seat,
devouring a novel of Scott's. But then, what
boy wouldn't? And, besides, he was not
gormandizing. Nor was he any little priggish
"grind" in his school. He simply labored
away at each lesson until he got it,-and then
the kernel of knowledge within was his forever
after. Whereupon he burst out to play.

HIS EARLY YEARS IN MT. AUBURN

Taft was a field and pasture boy. He was
as wholesomely remote from the rough as
from the milk-and-water type; nor later, when
"feeling his oats," did he bluster about sowing
any of them. Mt. Auburn was sparsely
settled then, and Cincinnati was yet too young
to offer the vices of a big city. The Mt.
Auburn youngsters-now lawyers, judges, and
solid merchants-reed in the open. At
night or on rainy Saturday afternoons, the old
billiard table in the Taftâ€˜home served better
than a parental frown. These boys needed
nothing so little as a pool-room, and they never
did need to "loaf." As for the present Secre-
tary of War, they all say that he has not scat-
tered enough "wild oats" to feed a mustang
colt.

There was a hollow below Mt. Auburn on
either side, one being popularly known as

A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

Butchertown and the other as Tailortown.
Whenever the Ridge "gang" (Mt. Auburn)
got tired among themselves, as with green-
apple battles in the Taft orchard, they could
always pick a fight with either of the hollow
"gangs," and just possibly there were rocks
thrown. Tait, as you may have guessed
already from the inevitable in biography, was
of course the leader. The boys themselves,
though, took it as the most natural thing in
the world. He was only coming into his own,
by this activity. "Bill" was a fellow they
could back up, and they felt this instinct,
ively. Moreover, they had a love for him, a love
that has endured to this day; it grows evident
in the tone of their voices when they speak of
"Old Bill." A prosperous merchant of
Cincinnati said quite simply that he would
lend to "Bill" Taft the very last cent
he had, and with never a scrap of paper
to show for it. Another, a lawyer, observed
just as simply that "Bill" Taft could not be
budged or bought by the "six hundred, or
however many billions of dollars there hap-
pens to be in the whole United States."
They were reared with him, these two. And
when they and a half-score others tell of him
as a boy, their trust in him and their abiding
affection for him are no longer strange, but
are a rebuke to all misanthropes.

Then and since, they say, it was a char-

_acteristic of Taft never to utter a word against

anyone who was absent. If he could say
nothing good, you would see in his worried
blue eyes that he was trying to think of some-
thing to the absent one's credit with which
to breast the drift of scandal. As for telling
on another, he would take "a licking" first.
His full brothers, Henry and Horace, were of
the same stripe, and it is remembered that one
of the three was suspended from school for a
prank that others had played. Judge Taft,
their father, used the strap, thinking he had
the real culprit in hand, and the young gentle-
man accepted the "thrashing" without a word.

TAFT AS A GENUINE BOY

"Bill" Taft was thoroughly a boy-a big,
clean, honest, out-and-out boy. Such a big-
boned, stout, happy fellow was bound to come
in for nicknames, and he has always had them,
from the time the neighborhood dubbed him
"Lub'' until he was "Santo Taft" to the
Filipinos. The Mt. Auburn youngsters also
called him "Lead-Head-and-Cotton-Body,"
