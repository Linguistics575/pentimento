THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

Tite of any mistakes of method that he may
make and in spite of the gross mistakes of
loquacity that some of his official family have
made. If he were to modify his general policy,
then many of the masses would stand with-
let us say some Hearst or other. The Great
Interests may, if they are foolish enough, cause
the rise of class-hatred and bringthe danger of
an angry class-conflict.

Mr. Roosevelt is a man who understands
the necessity of keeping property secure; he
was reared among the property-owning class;
he is a "rich" man in the sense that he is not
a poor man; he has the same regard for the
preservation of real wealth as any other man
of the property-holding, class has. Moreover,
he has not a much longer period in the White
House. He would be pleased to end his term
with great popularity. He has mule enough
enemies, and doubtless he would be glad not
to add to the list of them. He has an abhor-
renee of disorder in the finsrncial world, as in
any other part of American life. His ideal
American citizen is a prosperous, vigorous,
normal, cheerful, productive man; and a man
mnnot be very productive or very cheerful if he
be not reasonably prosperous.

He is, then, pursuing his course not recle
lessly but deliberately and for the sole purpose
of correcting the criminal methods of the
predatory corporations which have brought
abnormal conditions; and he is not going to
change that course, in spite of the vindictive
action of some courts and state governments,
nor in spite of the hubbub in Wall Street.

The assumption of Wall Street is that the
stability of values of the great fmancial interests
is the most sacred thing in the world;that any
attack on a rich man or company or kind of
"securities'' means anarchy; and that the
safety of the finances of the rich is of more
importance than the financial safety of the
poor. The swollen vanity of this view of
the world is one of the most pitiful things in
American life. It would be merely ludicrous
if it were not dangerous; for if the rich or their
spokesmen cry out too painfully, they may
cause a panic, as men cause a panic at a fire
by mere excitement.

This is not a rich man's country nor a poor
man's country. It ought to belong-and it
will belong-to every man, rich or poor, in
proportion to his honest earnings and his
character in their management. But it is-and
it will K-the country of the honest man, the

man who obeys the laws, which are made alike
for rich and for poor, and the man who regards
his neighb:sr's rights as sacred as his own.

CHANGING METHODS OF CORPORATION LAWYERS

Ir ANY man ask for proof of the change
that is taking place in the management
of corporations, let him investigate the work
now being done by the best corporation lawyers.
A few years ago, they had no hesitation in
using dummies in making organizations, not
dummies for merely technical reasons but for
the very structure of corporations. They
guarded their clients chiefly against the dangers
of internal dissensions and the dangers of
technical violations of the law. Now there is
a great change in the practice of corporation
law. The advice that you will receive is that
the directors must really direct; that the stock-
holders must be considered; that the issues
of stock must bear rigid investigation; that
expenses must be charged where they belong;
and your corporation lawycr's mind is fixed
on the possibility that the corporation may
at some time be investigated. The practically
complete disappearance of thc non-directing
director is another noteworthy change.

Now these changes, and many more like
them, did not come of themselves nor did they
come from the inner grace of corporation
lawyers. They came because of the pressure
that is everywhere felt for the cleaner and more
scrupulous conduct of corporate business. This
pressure com through the national govern-
ment, or through the state goverment, or
merely by the general awakening. The main
matter is, that there is such a pressure and
that such a change is taking place.

THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

HE fhest act of the new Public Utilities
Commission of New York was the inves-
tigation of the traction situation in New York
City, beginning with the subway, the elevated
roads, and the surface lines of Manhattan
Borough. The Commission went swiftly to
work. Within a few weeks of the taking of
office, Chairman Willcox and his committee
were probing into the affairs of the so-called
Interboro-Metropolitan Company.

Under the skilful questioning of Mr. W. M.
Ivins, the counsel of the Commission, there
have been revealed to the public many dark
secrets. Almost every financial wrong-doing
of which a corporation is capable has been
