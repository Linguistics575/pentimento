T this time of the year, when men begin
~25 many as can-to put aside their
routine work ic: l few weeks' rest, it

is pleasant to look about and see what great
forces are at work to lift living to a little higher
level and give inspiration to nobler endeavor.
The task is the more pleasant this year because
"d fair inventory of the activities and of the
good fortune of the pcoplc of the United
States must show a cheerful total.

There is one fact in particular that must
make a profound impression on any student
of contemporary events. For a year or two,
tinancial trouble has been feared and by many
well-informed men it has been' repeatedly
predicted. Many have firmly belicvcrl that
the National Government’s efforts to restrain
corporations would check investments and
hinder industry; many have felt sure that the
restrictive and in some cases violent legislation
of some of the states would so drive capital
to cover, that legitimate industry would halt;
and others have feared that the im'itlious
emphasis that has bcL-n put on wealth during
this long agitation would encourage a riolcnt
class feeling by the poor against the rich and
would bring an era of dangerous economic and
social experiments.

Nothing of this kind has happened. The
public has refused to be frightened by the
fears or by the threats of the great corporations,
and the great corporations hare not been
hurt in their legitimate activity by any rising
tide of popular anger. There could hardly
be better proof either of the safe foundations
of our prosperity or of thc (:ssontiztl soundncss
of the pcoplc's judgment.

b of Events

Doubtless we shall have more fhrcmriil
panics and more pani s of popular thought
(which are closely akin); but for the present,
at least. we are keeping our balance prettywcll.

A CONSTRUCTIVE INFLUENCE

HE continual prosperity is proof that the

great economic laws which (lctcrminc
production, distribution, and consumption art-
far too fundamental to bc serious . offertud
by restrictive legislation and inrcstiyption.
Incidentally, our continued prosperity proves
also that the general tcndency of (‘orporzttc
regulation is rather toward business security
than toward disturbance. Some foolish local
laws do dumage as far as they go. But tlw
main tendency of the whole gi tion of the'se
last two or thrcc years is rt‘assuring and
constructive.

Proof of this is easy to lint]. Consider, for
instance, the prohibition of railroad passes.
E cry railroad in the country hits pmlitutl hy
it; and they have prolited not only hy thr
receipt of increased revenue from farce but own
more by relief from a vicious system of srcci:d
favors, which was a system of putty hhu'kmniL
Again, in every case whom a rclxltc has hmn
stopped, not only has the railroad vccvivcsrl n10ru
mum'y for its sct'viro but it Ms given the min
pctitorh of thc rvlxrtcx-rcrvircr a greater su'ut ity
in thuir business.

A lurgcr result than all thvsc is tlu, gcnrml
awakening of the public cons< icm'c about tht-
mnnztgcmcnt of corporations. Not only haw
railroads and other pullV-swsrvict' mrpm-zttions
