stage of civilization, now long past the tribal
organization. And this must be done without

mere tribal organization that national strength
and race-strength originally came.

WORK FOR EVERYBODY

HE Bureau of Labor (at Washington)

has made a systematic inquiry about the

demand for workers in every part of the United

States, and one of its officers has given out this
statement:

"No man in this country, able and willing to work, has
any excuse for idleness. There is demand from practically
every state for labor, both skilled and unskilled. The
governors or other officials are calling on us to send them
men and women who want work, and giving assurances
that the work will be provided. The factories and farms,
the mines and mills, all join in the chorus of demand, while
from everywhere comes the note M insistence that more
domestic servants be provided."

The most insistent demand is for farm la-
borers, because theirs is among the least remun-
erative of all work done by men. So great has
become this demand that, in many sections of
the country, farms have been wholly or in part
abandoned and can be bought at very low
prices.
England, but something of the same condition
is coming in other parts of the Union also.
The Southern States are among the most insist-
ent for farm laborers, Louisiana offering, for
example, free houses and free fuel (bills for
fuel there are at most not enormous!). A man
who can and will work a farm can get land at a
profitably low price in most of the Southern
States. In fact, a man who can work the land
well, may anywhere become independent.

Mechanics-skilled labor of almost every
kind-are needed in most parts of the country,
except in the large cities, to which, of course,
they flock in the greatest numbers because
wages there are highest.

Yet in every city there are swarms of people
who, if they do not lack employment, lack pro-
ductive and lucrative work. Men and women
(and sometimes children) by the hundreds of
thousands are at work in sweat-shops and in
hopelessly uneconomic pursuits who, if they
would work the soil with intelligence or would
learn skilled trades, could become independent,
to their own betterment and to the betterment
of the whole community and especially to the
betterment of their offspring.

This is conspicuously true in New'

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

THE CHEAPNESS OP LIFE

IN MANY parts of the United States, in

the Southern States in particular, the
"unwritten law" is stronger than the law
against murder. There have recently been
two cases in Virginia. The kinsmen of
wronged women have been acquittal for killing
their betrayers. In one case there was no
evidence of crime done by the man that was
killed except the unsupported word of the
woman. Since the acquittal of the murderer,
women in that community have begun a move
ment to erect a monument to the young man
who was murdered, this being their way of
expressing their belief in his innocence. Again,
in Mississippi, Governor Vardaman pardoned
a woman who had been convicted of killing
a man who had done her wrong and told about
it when he was drunk. This was a sort of
extension of the "unwritten law" in a curious
way. It was as much as to say that if a man
may with impunity kill another man who has
wronged a woman, a woman herself may kill
a man who commits crime with her and re-
veals it.

It requires no argument to show that the
"unwritten law" is only one evidence of the
cheapness with which life is held, just as
execution by a mob is another evidence of the
same thing. If a man may kill another on
the unsupported evidence of a woman and be
sure of acquittal, we pass at once beyond the
reign of law and come into a social order where
private vengeance has sway.

There are other evidences of a different sort
of the cheapness with which we hold human life.
There was an accident a little while ago in the
Pennsylvania tunnel under New York City, and
a man was kilkd. There are many accidents
in these tunnels and there is a long list of
victims. In this case the man killed "was
known only as "Tony.' His number was 857.
Nothing was known of his address, his relatives,
or his friends. . The death of 'Tony'
was reported to the coroner's office and his body
was sent to the morgue." The foreman was
arrested. But in this case, as in practically all
other such "accidents," nobody is punished.

Of course, in many such cases where men
are doing hazardous work they lose their lives
by their own carelessness. But in many more
instances, the accidents result from the careless-
ness of somebody else. Yet, however stringent
the laws, they are seldom enforced. Incidents of
this sort show again how cheap human life is--
