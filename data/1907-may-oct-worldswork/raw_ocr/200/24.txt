engage his thoughts and his time-a farm, a
factory, a school, a craft, a family, his relation
to his neighbors, his duties to his community,
his enjoyment of an active and more or less
normal life. The big headlines in the news-
papers do not startle him. A sudden shrinkage
of values from the level of a great inflation
does not disturb him, for he has few securities
or none. The reports of a sensational criminal
trial in court neither entertain him nor disturb
him as much as the conductors of the "yellow"
journals seem to think. He cannot be made
to believe that the railroad trains will cease to
run because the legislature reduced the pits
senger fare to two cents a mile, nor that
President Roosevelt is wrecking the country.
Most of the subjects that are loudly talked
about in the newspapers seem remote to the
Average American Citizen. '

The daily press reports, and to a degree
creates, a sort of artificial life. The big men
in Wall Street are alarmed! The big men in
Washington are doing vast damage! Pre-
sently the women at Newport will be active
in great social affairs! But all these Great
Worlds are really remote from the everyday
thought of the millions of us who have little
power and much contentment with life that
moves in smaller orbits. We read the head-
lines and go on about our business.

A great financier, a great statesman, a great
leader of fashion, or a great anybody else,
would be startled and perhaps humiliated to
learn how little we really know or care about
him. If such a Great Person should step
from a train at a town in Kansas or in Texas
or in Georgia-without the blare of greatness
-and were to live there for a time inmgm'tu,
he would discover that the condition of the
road to the next town is of greater importance
than the fluctuations of Union Pacific stock,
that the building of the new schoolhouse is
an event of importance to more persons than
the last report about anybody's Presidential
"boom"; that the "stand" of wheat or of
cotton is watched with much more concern
than the latest investigation of any trust; that
the latest marriage in Smithville is talked about
by as many good women as the latest ball in
Newport.

Whether you be a Great Man or an Average
Man, it is a good exercise of your modesty to
go to Smithville, where nobody knows you,
and to make a study of life there by at least a
few days' observation in the town and in the

country about it. You may at first think life
there very dull; but, unless you are dull your-
self, you are likely to come away reflecting on
the narrow range of your own thought and
on the number of purely artificial interests
that you burden yourself with. The normal
man carries few worries, and such as he does
carry are his own-not worries about far-off
problems or about gigantic forces or about
great battles in finance and politics and society.
Nor does he himself get into the newspapers.
Those that live in the artificial world of the
noisy journals often forget the Average Man
in his modest life, his quiet contentment, and his
steady industry. And, when the "great centres"
of these artificial industries become excited, it
is well to recall him; for if he is well, we are
well; and if he is happy and reasonably
prosperous, we shall all fare likewise; for he
is the United States, because he is one of the
millions-the millions who are the steady
base of our democracy.

THE DANGER OF AN INDUSTRIAL SETBACK j

EVERAL railroads have announced that
they think it expedient to stop new con-
structive work and to husband their money;
and this is one of the chief reasons of the feel..
ing of uncertainty in the financial and indus-
trial outlook. There are many other reasons,
but they lie deeper. We saw a setback to our
industry in 1903, but it amounted to little as
we view it in retrospect. It might have
amounted to much more had Europe not then
had funds a-plenty, and rushed them to our
assistance when the terms became good enough
to tempt them.

At present, if a crisis should arise, Europe
could hardly help us, because Europe itself is
in need of more money. There is a scareity
both here and abroad. A crisis would, there-
fore, test our own strength far beyond the
test of 1903. The situation to-day is much
more like the situation in 1892, which was
followed by the disasters of 1893.

Let us balance the threatening features
against the steadying influences, seeking to
measure the situation as it stands. Primarily,
we are short of funds. The New York banks,
upon whom the stock-market burden falls
most heavily, have allowed their surplus
practically to disappear, and have been com-
pelled to use the most drastic means to streng-
then it. All over the country, the demand for
money has been urgent for the last six months,
