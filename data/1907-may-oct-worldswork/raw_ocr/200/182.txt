A NEW SCHOOL OF HISTORIANS

Most notable has been the work done in
historical writing. That the American His-
torical Association should have met in New
Orleans in 1904, that four of the American
Nation series should be written by South-
emers, and that a score or more of specialists
in history are now, either in leading univer,
sities or in their own colleges in the South,

pursuing definite lines of historical research,,
As a result'

are matters of prime importance.
of the excellent work in history at Johns Hopkins
University inaugurated by the late Herbert B.
Adams, and the later interest in Southern his-
tory manifested by the departments of history
at Columbia and Harvard, there has come a
change in the point of view and in the style of
Southern historians. In spite of excessive
hours of teaching and of meagre libraries for
research work, and in spite of a constant de-
mand on the part of many Southerners that
history should be written to substantiate pre-
viously formed opinions, Southern scholars
have made rapid progress in the study and
interpretation of Southern life and history,

Much of the work up tothis time has been in
the form of monographs, which are often lacking
in literary charm and in philosophical grasp;
but such foundation work has been absolutely
necessary. Such writings as Houston's
"Nullification in South Carolina," Garner's
"Reconstruction in Mississippi," Bruce's
"The Plantation Negro as a Freeman,"
Fleming/s "Civil War and Reconstruction in
Alabama," and the volumes in the American
Nation series already referred to, take rank
with the best work of the kind done by Ameri-
can scholars. The works on a larger scale
by McCrady, Hannis Taylor, and Woodrow
Wilson show how far we have come from the
work of Pollard, Stephens, and Gayarr√©.
A singularly impartial study of the causes
leading to the Civil War is "The Brothers'
War I' by Mr. John C. Reed, of Atlanta, who
has given even the New England abolitionist his
due. Mr.William Garrett Brown, in his "Lower
South in American History," and his Atlantic
Monthly articles on the decade after the Civil
War, has so combined scholarly research with

THE SOUTH'S INTELLECTUAL EXPRESSION

literary charm and philosophical perspective
as to give promise of being one of the great
American historians.

Of less historical value, but of more popular
interest, has been the publication of Southern
memoirs and letters and reminiscences. Gen-
eral Gordon's "Reminiscences of the Civil
War" is a distinct advance on earlier books,
which were often written by Southern generals
without proper study. "Ihe Letters and Recol-
lections of Robert E. Lee," by his son, Capt.
Robert E. Lee, give better than any previous life
the story of Lee's last years at Lexington. The
book reveals Lee as--in spirit and in work---
the leader of the New South, as well as the con-
summate flower of the civilization of the Old
South. There are scattered throughout the
letters golden words that should be the in-
spiration of every forward movement in the
South to-day, for Lee was with the forces that
make for progress rather than reaction, for
constructive effort rather than futile obstruction,
for nationalism rather than seetionalism.

We have had a rather noteworthy lot of
sprightly, entertaining books by Southern
women who have touched with charm some out-
of-the-way nooks and corners of history. If
they have lacked the scientific point of view of
the studies already referred to, they are in-
teresting as human documents. Mrs. Avary's
"A Southern Girl During the War," and
"Dixie after the War,"Mrs. Clay's "A Belle of
the 'Fifties," and Mrs. Pryor's "Reminiscences
of Peace and War" have conveyed to a large
number of people the humor, pathos, and
tragedy of eventful times. Of distinctly better
quality is John S. Wise's "The End of'an
Era," which is perhaps the most vivid picture
of life just before and during the war that has
yet been written. Chapters in a most inter-
esting autobiography-yet to be completed,
one may hope---may be found in the files of the
Forum and the Atlantic Monthly. I refer to
the sketches by Professor Gildersleeve of his
early life in Charleston and of his experiences
as a teacher in the University of Virginia and
as a member of Gord0n's staff.

ESSAYS AND LITERARY CRITICISM

The fine literary flavor of "Essays and Stud,
ies" by the same author suggests a kind of writ-
ing in which the activity has not been so great as
in the field of historical writing. The South has
an honorable record in suggesting the lines along
which the teaching of English has proceeded.
