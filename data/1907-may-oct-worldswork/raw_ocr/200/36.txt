and is unusually well-informed. In travel he
is enthusiastic, and has penetrated most of
the corners of Europe. In golf he is a devotee.
In organized religious effort he has always been
interested, and has rendered most valuable
assistance to the church. In music and art
and scientific invention he has been a wide
and constant reader.

These broad ranges of interest give him a
genuine human quality, which grapples his
friends with hoops of steel. He does not,
indeed, clap a friend on the back with that
impertinent breczincss and effrontery which
in some circles take the place of real esteem
and human kindness. But a better story-
teller, or a more wholeesouled companion
on a journey, it would be hard to find. I
have heard him read the effusions of "Mr.
Dooley" to scores of friends with fuoe dramatic
power, and keenest delight in the humor of
the book.

HIS VIEW OF PUBLIC LIFE

But what chiefly concerns us today is Mr.
Hughes's conception of public life as simply
public service. He regards himself, in his
own words, as "trustee of the people's con-
fidence." To abuse that confidence would be
to him the depth of periidy; to deserve and
honor it is for him the supreme ambition. He
is immensely democratic in his principles,
believing in the people as heartily as did
Abraham Lincoln. The higher education and

a friendly acquaintance with great financiers
have not changed in the smallest degree his
faith in popular government. He does not
crave political office, and gladly looks forward
to the time when he can resume the practice
of his profession. But, having been summoned
against his will into the arena of public life, it
must be confessed that he enjoys it.
confront opposition with as much zest as he
can face a precipitous Alpine summit. Heartily
he believes that "aggressive fighting for the
right is the greatest sport in the world." He
is faithful to his trust, not because he has
determined to be heroic, but because to be
unfaithful seems to him stupid and inane and
inconceivable, He moves from task to task,
not so much under pressure of the "New
England conscience," as in the light of a clear
intelligence which shows him that no enduring
achievement is possible, except along lines of
truth and righteousness.

When a noted politician recently tried to get
Governor Hughes to support him in a certain
personal scheme, he came away utterly crest-
fallen, saying: "That is the strangest man
I ever met. You can't make any sort of trade
with him; you can't approach him on the side
of personal advantage; you can't seem to
touch his political ambition. He is beyond
me; the fool simply does right the whole
time!‚Äù Of such noble folly the country
may safely expect Mr. Hughes to continue
guilty.
