cent. In a tablespoonful of tomato ketchup,
one would cat 0.16 of a grain. From I to 10
grains of benzoic acid are eliminated through
the kidneys every day by human beings, largely
in the form of hippuric acid. One grain of
benzoic acid in a "helping" of a given food is
safe and harmless-but suppose we get it in
a dozen foods at one meal?

A CATALOGUE OF FOOD INIQUITIES

The following examples show the most
common substitutes, adulterants, and pre-
servatives employed:

Jams and Jellies. Adulterants: Apple juice
is the "stock" for all the jellies and jams.
It is mixed with "commercial glucose" (not
unhealthful), flavored with an artificial essence,
and colored with a synthetic dye or cochineal.
Gelatine is often used to "icll" the mixture;
also a "coagulator" of citric or tartaric acid.
About 10 per cent. of jellies and jams on the
market are pure.

Ketclmps. Adulterants: Skins and refuse of
canning factories (cheap, but not necessarily
unhealthy); sometimes fermented, when sali-
cylic or benzoic acid becomes needed. A bad
article. Colorings: Standard ketchup should
be dull, partially bleached red. Aniline dyes
or cochineal are used in more than 80 per cent.
The bright magenta stuff should be refused.

Milk. Adultcrant: Water. Belief in the
use of starch, chalk, glycerin, etc., may be
discarded. Skimming, and both skimming
and watering, are frequent. Coloring and
preserving: Skimmed and watered milk is
given a rich, creamy appearance by adding
annatto, azo-colors, or caramel. Formalde-
hyde, boric acid, borax, and sodium bicarbonate
are used to check or conceal fermentation.

Butter. Adulterants: Coloring matter-
carrot juice, annatto, turmeric, azo, or coal-tar
colors. Uncolorcd natural butter is best, and
artificially colored butter should be rejected.
Renovated butter is made from rancid material;
it is water-heated to remove the curd, brine
and scum; then it is air-blown to drive off the
bad odors, mixed with milk (often skimmed
milk), "ripened," worked, salted, and packed.

Oleomargarine, or butterine, is made from
oleo oil as the main base, and variously mixed
with neutral lard, milk, genuine butter, color-
ing matter, and small amounts of cottonseed,
peanut, or sesame oil. Olco oil comes from
beef fat, lining the intestine and "caul," a
Mc, pun: article, hashed, melted, and pressed.

The oil then contains stearine, from which it
is strained. Adulterants; Not likely, but fat
from diseased animals may be used. Stand-
ard oleomargarine is as healthful and nutri-
tious as pure butter, and better than reno-
vated butter.
It is always colored.

Detection: Pure butter boils quietly in a
spoon; renovated butter and butterinc sputter.

CONFLICTING LAWS ABOUT FOODS

To secure food safety, there should first be
a national standard to arbitrarily state what is
wholesome and what is not; second, the iinal
buyer should know exactly what he is
purchasing.

There is at present no standard authority
on foods. The so-called "Pure Food Law"
makes the United States Pharmacopoeia the
standard authority for all drugs. This pharma-
copoeia may have errors of omission, or of
commission; but it is the safest possible author-
ity. It is the consensus of our national drug
knowledge, constantly undergoing elimination
and addition with further experience. There
is no such standard for foods. What is good
food at Crossroads Corners may be outlawed
across the border. Michigan says "X" straw-
berry jam shall be labeled "imitation";
Wisconsin says it shall be labeled "glucose
preserves"; Minnesota says it shall be labeled
"imitation preserves, mixture adulterated."
If any of the jam labeled inNinnesota got
across the Duluth bridge into Wisconsin it was
outlawed; and if the Wisconsin jam slipped
over into Duluth, it went legally bad. When
a manufacturer put the labels of all three states
on the peripatetic cans, they were all thrown
out. And one of these labels gave the exact
formula of the jam: Apples, 15 per cent.;
granulated sugar, 45 per cent., and "fruit" as
indicated.

It is more difficult to determine the values
of foods than of drugs. The use of preserva-
tives is rapidly extending, for it is cheaper to
preserve than to pasteurize, and foods can be
sent further. But while oneÂ»tcnth of one per
cent. of benzoic acid with one article of food
may be absolutely harmless, if the drug is put
into a number of foods we may get an overdose
at a single meal. Yet it may be wiser to use
preservatives in some foods than to run risks
of ptomaine poisoning, but the use of preserva-
tives should be limited by necessity. Some
