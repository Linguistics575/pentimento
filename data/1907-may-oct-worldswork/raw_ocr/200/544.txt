THE PERIL OF JAPAN

ITS CRITICAL CONDITION CAUSED BY INCREASED TAXES AND WAR-DEBTS

JAPAN stands to-day at the parting of the
ways. Neither its statesmen nor the
students of iec0r10rt1y who study it

from foreign lands can clearly tell its future.
Briefly, Japan of to-day dates from April, 1868,
the year after the beginning of the reign of
the present Mikado. In that month was pro-
mulgated the "Imperial Oath of Five Articles,"
which is the basis of Japanese civilization. The
substance of these articles may be outlined:

(1) Public opinion shall decide all measures
of government, through the deliberative
assemblies.

(2) All classes shall unite to carry out the
Government plans.

(3) All the people shall be allowed to fulfil
their proper desires, so that all shall be happy.

(4) Uncivilized customs shall be broken
through, and everything shall be based on the
law of nature.

(5) Knowledge shall be drawn from all the
world, that the Empire may be built up.

It was in the next year that the great change
was made. Hitherto, Feudalism had been the
law. The Daimios, or leaders, had held power
over their people, even to life and death. They
had also held the lands. They gave up the
lands to the crown, and surrendered all their
power over the people, and also their respon-
sibility for the lives and persons of the people.
The nobles received, in return, one-tenth of
the revenue formerly accruing from their lands;
and the soldier retainers received pensions,
afterwards funded into national bonds.

It was that change that made modern Japan.
Within little more than half a man's lifetime,
practically the last trace of Feudalism has gone.
To-day, justice, legislation, administration, and
political power centre at one capital. It has
been forty years of centralization and organ-
ization. If one take the latter-day evidences
of Japanese life, and study them in close con-
nection with the Five Articles, it becomes
evident at once that those articles have been
no dead-letter. They have been the vitalizing
principle of the Government at every one of
the difficult and dangerous steps that have

been taken to bring the nation to its present
position.

It was the Feudal system that made Japan
light-hearted, gay, and happy. The depend-
ents of the great nobles lived in the day that
sped, worrying not at all over the prospects
of to-morrow: for was not the Daimia great,
and rich, and generous? Food, when the
harvests failed, came to them from his largess.
His power protected them in their rights, gave
them the law, left them free to amuse them,
selves, to labor happily abroad in his fields,
or to follow joyously the gentle arts of manu-
facture that they loved. So it was that their
children were always happy, and laughter
lay upon the land like sunshine.

At first the change was barely felt by the
people at large. Solid pensions were granted
to the old retainers. Between 1872 and 1878,
the Government issued more than $90,000,000
of bonds to fund these pensions, and the bonds
paid from 5% to 10% interest. The pension
granted to the old Samurai, or retainer, was
quite sufficient to keep him in comfort, and to
keep his children happy. But the pension
did not increase as his descendants increased.
To-day, the Samurai of 1870 and his little
family are represented by dozens of people,
their children and their children's children.
The principal of the pension has been scattered,
so that no single one of the family has enough
to live upon.

And it has all been fearfully sudden. France
and England faced the same problem six
hundred years ago, and solved it; but in each
case it took two hundred years in the solution
and, even so, entailed upon the people much
suffering and left a heritage of poverty and
misery. Japan does nothing slowly. In edu-
cation, for instance, it was not content to
take a generation for transition. The Samurai
youths, whose education in former days was
about equally divided between the gentle arts
of fencing, swimming, jiu-jitsu, archery, and
reading, wcre plunged into a full-fledged West-
ern school. We are told by a great Japanese
educator that such authors as Mill, Spencer,
