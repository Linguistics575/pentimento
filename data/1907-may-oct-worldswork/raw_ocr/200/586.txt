of the people. Nor is there going to be any
less capital in the world nor any less owned by
Americans than there is now. In fact, the total
of real wealth every year becomes greater.
Why, then, is there a feelingr that the tide of
prosperity may slacken? Why do men ap-
prehend a change from good times to bad?

The Only Change That Can Come

There is but one change that can come to
slacken the tide of prosperity, and that is a
change in the freedom with which money flows
into productive industries. If a large amount
of capital were to be hoarded or to be locked
up in undertakings that did not pay and from
which it could not be withdrawn without great
loss, then that much capital would, for the time
being, be lost to productive industry; and, to
that extent, useful and profitable work would
be checked or suspended. Money would, to
that extent, become "high" and "timid."

In fact, this very thing has taken place, to a
degree. Money that would otherwise have
been available for productive uses was spent
or consumed in the Boer War (English con-
sols have, therefore, fallen lower than they have
been in recent times), in the Japanese-Russian
War, in the destruction of San Francisco, or
has gone into the rehabilitation of Japan and
into a hundred lesser and similar diversions
from the customary channels. For these rea-
sons, money is high and certain classes of
securities are low in all the principal countries.
The phenomenon is not confined to the United
States.

But this result may also be caused, or
augmented, by a mere state of mind. It is
not necessary that great sums be spent in war
to cause an apparent scarcity of money.
Suppose that men in the United States who
own only a few million dollars, and who have
for ten years been actively using this sum-in
railroads, in factories, in banks, keeping it
going all the while and allowing, it to flow
freely into all sorts of enterprises-suppose
these men become afraid and withdraw their
money from general use; suppose they sell
their interest in thousands of small industries
and put these millions into lands that yield
nothing now or into government bonds and
other low-yielding securities; in other words,
suppose they invest their wealth in less produc-
tive ways and withdraw their money from a
thousand paying industries, simply because
they become alarmed-what happens then?

MARCH OF EVENTS

The owners of this capital of course receive
reduced incomes. But they can afford that
loss, for they save their principal. But the
multitude of working producers lose more or
less of their productive business. Money
becomes too high. They cannot go on making
their accustomed profits; and very soon the
weaker among them fail; and presently we have
"hard limes" or a panic-all because men who
control capital become afraid.

This is one way in which panics come. It
is practically the only way in which a stop in
our present prosperity can come. The whole
question, then, narrows itself to this: Is there
any good reason why men should become
afraid and withdraw money from productive
uses? There is no sound reason why they
should. Any comprehensive survey of the
industrial condition of the world, and particu-
larly of the United States, will fail to disclose
any sound reason for fear.

But fear may come without sound reasons--
may come for insufficient and even silly reasons.
There are as many such reasons as there are
superstitions or prejudices held by men; and
short-sighted men manufacture reasons for fear.

Financial Machinery Al Fault

The worst of it is that our financial machinery
is so constructed as to cause any fear, whether
it be reasonable or not, to spread; for it is too
much under the control of a non-productive
class of men, or men who can afford to be non-
productive, and of men who can, by the aid of
this machinery, use not only their own capital
but the money of the productive classes as
pawns in a game. If a man could withdraw
from industry only his own money, the country
is so large and wealth is so distributed that
perhaps no very serious damage could be done,
even if many men should become panic-stricken.
But our financial machinery is such that men
who control it can practically withdraw from
industry not only their own money but parts of
yours and mine and our neighbors'; and they
can use much of it, when money becomes
high, in their own games of financial thimble-
rigging-use it as gamblers or misers use
money. It is not the real wealth in the country
that these men can directly control, but the
surplus wealth, the ready money, the liquid
capital; and that is enough to disturb values.

The one great weakness in our fmancial and
industrial life lies in this weakness of our bank-
ing and corporate machinery, and in the
