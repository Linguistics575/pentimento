I I tHE recent dedication of the McKinley
monument in front of the State House
at Columbus, 0., not only disrlosud

to public view a superb work of art and a faith-

ful representation of the late President; it also
brought again to public notice Mr. Hermon

A. MacNeil, a young sculptor whose previous

work had received wide recognition. Innepa-

rubly associated with Mr.MacNuil, in the minds
of all who know him and his work, is his wife,

Mrs. Carol Brooks Marl [eil, herself "ct sculptor

artist family also includes two handsome boys
who play about the studio and sometimes pose
as models.

him at th ation tlielirst time he czime home
from Wa 1ington." It was this quality of

the general public when his Farragut was
unveiled; and it is the chief characteristic of
that sculptor's statues of Lincoln and Sherman.
A foreign visitor brought face to face with the
McKinley statue would feel instinctively that
here stands a great American statesman.

In securing this result, Mr. MacNeil had no
easy task. McKinlcy’s figure was essentially
unhcroic; his head was good, but not striking;
nor were his features salient or picturesque.
But the artist went to his work with an energy
that overlooked no representation of the late
