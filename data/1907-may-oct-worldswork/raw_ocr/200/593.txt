had shipped its products over all three of them,
paying one road six cents, another six and one
quarter cents (because of some greater advan.
tages at the point of delivery), and paying the
Alton road six cents. The other roads had
published the six-cent and the six-and-one.
quarter-cent rates and filed them with the Inter-
state Commerce Commission, as required by
the law. The Alton road had openly quoted
to the Oil Company its six-cent rate, but it had
failed technically to publish this rate and to
file it with the Commission-a purely technical
omission of duty by the railroad, for there was
no concealment of the rate and no discrimina-
tion. The last rate on these products properly
published and filed by the Alton road was an
old "class" rate of eighteen cents, which was
never used. There was no dispute of these
facts; and the crime, if crime was committed,
was (as every layman would suppose) a crime
of the Alton road.

But Judge Landis refused to admit these
facts in the evidence. He held the testimony
rigidly to the facts that the last rate filed by
the Alton road was eighteen cents and that the
Oil Company had paid only six cents. He
declared that the presumption is "that the
honest man who tenders a commodity will not
be fraudently misled by the railroad company
into allowing it to haul his property for less than
the law authorizes it to collect." In a word,
the shipper must ascertain whether the railroad
has complied with the law before he accepts
a rate quoted to him-must make sure that the
railroad is charging him enough. Judge Lan..
dis ruled that the Oil Company had not used
"due diligence" to determine whether the
railroad was disobeying the law.

The Standard Oil Company of Indiana was
therefore found guilty of shipping 1,462 car-
loads of oil at an unlawful rate; the Judge
imposed the maximum fine of $20,000 a car-
load, which is forty-four times as much as the
oil was worth.

The defendant was the Standard Oil Com-
pany of Indiana, a corporation of $1,000,000
capital. Judge Landis held an inquiry to
ascertain that much (or most) of this stock is
held by the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey, a corporation with a capital of
$100,000,000. When this was ascertained,
he imposed the colossal fine, regarding the New
Jersey corporation, which had not been in.

But the fine cannot by process of law be

collected from the New Jersey corporation.
Most competent lawyers know, too, that so
large a fine against the Indiana corporation is
confiscatory, and therefore in violation of the
United States Constitution; and it is practically
certain that the Supreme Court will so decide.
This conviction, secured by the Judge's
extraordinary rulings, and this fine, which it
is practically certain cannot be collected, there-
fore work great harm in arousing the suspicion
and the fear that a United States judge is
$b playing to the galleries." The probable truth
is that Judge Landis is a " hopelessly academic "
judge-that is to say, in plain English, lacks
common sense-and that he pursued a purely
technical course of reasoning to an absurdity.
But the impression made on the public mind
is that he made these extraordinary rulings and
imposed this extraordinary fine (larger than
any court ever imposed in any case in any
country) because, consciously or unconsciously,
he felt that, having at last convicted the arch,
criminal of all the trusts, he would make the
punishment fit the public clamor.

But whatever be the "psychological" explana-
tion of Judge Landis's reasoning and action,
the whole movement to bring great corporate
offenders to justice has been harmed; for such
sensational action by a court smacks of vin-
dietiveness. Public opinion may become vin-
dictive, as it often does. Even prosecuting
ofticers may, under provocation, become vin-
dictive, as, no doubt, they do. The press and
the public mood become sensational in their
judgments. Sensational suits are brought in
the courts. But when a United States court
becomes sensational and even provokes the
suspicion of showing vindictiveness-then (so
far as that court and that judge are concerned)
we have forsaken the calm method of exact
justice and taken up the method of judgment
by a public mood-mob judgment, in a word.
It is better that the worst criminal should
escape than that vindictiveness or attention
to public clamor (whether conscious or uncon<
scious) should affect the administration of
justice. Courts then become the instruments
of mob-opinion. This is a case of mobbing
a corporation. The fact that it is the most
unpopular of the great corporations makes the
matter worse rather than better.

The Standard Oil Company issued a pam-
phlet to its stockholders and employees (and
to the public) in explanation of this trial. The
body of this explanation was well conceived,
