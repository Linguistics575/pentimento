MORE OPERA AND MANY MORE PLAYS

HIS past season of grand opera in New
York has proved that classic music is
appreciated by a far wider range of people than
the purveyors of opera' had supposed. The
performances, under Mr. Heinrich Conried's
management at the Metropolitan Opera House
have been conducted on the theory that opera
is a luxury of the rich and an adjunct of fashion
and can be supported only by their patronage.
Mr. Oscar Hammerstein, however, proceeded
upon the theory that most of the musical appre-
ciation is found in the galleries. Thus, when
he opened the Manhattan Opera House last
winter, he had no subscription list for boxes,
and he set the price of seats at a lower average
than that of the Metropolitan. The quality
of the music and of the productions he has
offered has been generally considered equal to
that of the Metropolitan, in spite of the more
distinguished names of the singers at the older
house. The great success of the Manhattan
has justified Mr. Hammersteinâ€™s faith in his
theory. His house has become the centre of
the best popular opera in the country. And
the fact that the Metropolitan has suffered
little from the competition indicates that the
healthy growth of musical appreciation has made
another opera house a necessity in New York.

A similar condition exists among the theatres.
The two large theatrical combinations and the
many smaller managers have barely succeeded
this year in supplying the demand for theatrical
amusements. There are more than seventy
theatres in New York City alone, and these
have all been crowded.

This enormous public demand for music
and the drama argues a great increase in pros-
pcrity. With this must come, let us hope, also
higher standards of taste, and-perhaps--
better American plays.

THE JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION

HE Jamestown Exposition will empha-
size Virginia history-will, in fact,
inform a large part of the people that there is
such a thing as three hundred years of Vir-
ginia history. For the historical part of the
Exposition will be its most attractive feature to
the thoughtful visitor. To the larger com-
pany of sightseers, the almost continuous
naval pageant, in which the_ships of all the
principal governments will take part, will
make the strongest appeal. Beautifully sit-
uated directly on Hampton Roads, compact,

MARCH OF EVENTS

and easy of access, this fair is likely to be
visited by great throngs of persons during the
six months that it will be open; for it will
have the attraction of a seashore resort for the
inland millions.

Drawn by an historical interest, the descend,
ants of the Virginians are expected from every
part of the Union. The streams of them that
come may suggest for the first time to the
present generation the great part that the
colony and the state has played in our history.
How prolific a mother Virigina has been, is
even yet an untold chapter in our history.

THE RISE OF THE SOUTH

AT ONCE the most cheerful and important

fact of the time is the development of
the Southern States which is now going on at a
most gratifying pace-and with it, of course,
the multiform development of the people.
This takes its place in importance alongside
of the settlement and development of the
Middle West, which was one of the most
important social and economic facts of the
last century. It was this that made the
United States a great and rich country and
saved to mankind the benefits of free institu-
tions and applied them over a large area.

Now the long-looked-for time is come--
almost suddenly-when the rich and vast
area of the South is coming under similar
conquest, by the very people, too-or their
descendants-who have dwelt there since this
region became American. Industrial forces
have come into action, after a long period of
waiting and hindrance, that are fast making
these states realize the riches that have awaited
development. Wealth, cheerfulncss, and energy
are bringing the land and the people out of
isolation and into the full current of American
life. This is the great social and economic
fact for us, at least, of this decade-perhaps
of this half-century.

For this reason, THE WORLD'S WORK for
June will give most of its space to a description
of this progress; for we believe that thus to re-
port it and to emphasize it is as great a public
service as a journal given to the interpretation
of well-directed activity can do. The story
is so large that only specimen chapters of it
can be told in any magazine. But these speci-
men chapters, it is hoped, will be enough to
show that the most interesting great move-
ment now going on in our country is this rise
of the Southern people.
