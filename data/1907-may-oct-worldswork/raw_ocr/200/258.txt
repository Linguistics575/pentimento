and the following are some of their interesting
replies sent to this magazine;

"We are making our raw matcrialsinto finished products

ple's wares to a community of producers; and we are
eliminating, as fast as possible, the credit system in busi-
ness."-Macon, Ga.

"From ultra-conservatism and close ties to long-
established traditions to a conservative but broad spirit
of exploitation which has given a great impetus to every
phase of industrial devclopmcnt.''--Lyuckburg, Va.

"From a very general credit system to a practically
cash basis."-lcksov, Miss.

Some of the answers to the question, "What
have been the most noteworthy changes in
public opinion in ten years?" are:

"Influential man are becoming more practical about the
training of their sons, paying more attention to the trades
and agriculture,-getting away from the idea that a man
could not be a gentleman unless he were a lawyer, a doctor,
cr a preacher-econ, Ga.

"Political reform and independent voting are observed,

ownership idea has grown, and the city has voted $7oo,ooo

THE FUTURE OF CUBA

ITHIN the last nine years, American
and British capital to the extent of more
than $300,000,000 has Mwed into Cuba. The
movement appears to be in equilibrium at the
present moment, having been checked sharply
by the late insurrection. That it will resume

OF EVENTS

within the next year or so is the confulent hope
of those daring capitalists who have already
broken the field. If it does resume, and if it
continues uninterrupted for the space of a few
years, the future of Cuba is assured. It will
become a highly important commercial factor
in the world, in a sense in which it has never
had a right to be so considered hitherto. The
two "if's" at the beginning of this sentence
might seem sufficient qualification of a roseate
forecast for Cuba, yet they are but a part of
the limitations that beset the student who tries
to understand the position of that island.

To-day the United States has a provisional
government in the island, and all is well-
on the surface. Beneath the surface, the
Cubans and the financial powers that advanced
that $300,000,000 of capital are exerting
influences that may make or mar the coming
days in Cuba. The capitalists, of course,
want the provisional government to last for-
ever. The Cubans want it to last only long
enough to give the Cuban government the
power to cope with and regulate the capital-
istic power in Cuba in such a way that the
island will remain the birthright oi the Cubans.
The two aims are so entirely opposed that no
man may see the fu1al result.

By maintaining the "army of pacification"
in Cuba, the Government of the United States
is playing into the hands of the capitalists,
but at the same time it seems to be doing the
right thing for the Cubans themselves. Prob-
ably there will come a time when our Gov-
ernment must ask itself whether a continued
occupation would not be more for the capitalists
than for the Cubans. That time may not come
before the same question has to be answered
in respect to Britain in Egypt, but it may come
much earlier. In fact, the less responsible
element in Cuba is asking it today, just as the
srrcalled "Nationalists" are asking the similar
question in Egypt.

In any event, the one happy conclusion that
seems inevitable is that Cuba will not be al-
lowed to lapse into anarchy, nor to acquire the
weakness for chronic and dangerous revolution
that af0icts the republics of South America.
If the Cuban Government is not strong enough
to hold the country, the United States must
always stand ready to step in. If the Cuban
Government really gets that strength, the
United States should be ready to step out.
Of course, capital could stir up a revolution
of some sort if it were necessary, but such
