9088 A LIGHTHOUSE
mention particularly the south-bound vessels
because they labor under a great disadvantage
at the Cape, as they have to sail between the
shoals and the Gulf Stream, while those bound
north can go broad off in the Gulf Stream with
a fair tide.

"With a westerly wind, it is of great impor-
tance, to sailing vessels especially, to turn the
corner or elbow of the coast as near to thc shoal
as is safe, but at present they have no means of
knowing in the night or thick weather when
they are at a safe distance from this shoal.
In a clear night, under the most favorable
circumstances, many captains run their vessels
until they sink the light on the mainland at
Cape Hatteras below the horizon, but this
carries them twenty miles at sea into the strong
tide and rough water; in many instances, this
sweeps them back to the north and east, and
the vessels often lie off Hatteras for weeks in
trying to round the Cape. After this point is
passed, a vessel can sail with safety nearer the
shore and inside the influcnce of the tide.

"In thick or stormyweather, here is the home
of storms, with nothing to mark the shoals but
the foaming breakers; the vessels are tossed by
this peculiar Hatteras sea and swept back by
the ever-changing, rapid tide, into the vicinity
of the dreaded shoals. The greatest loss on
Hatteras Shoal is caused by having to give it
too wide a berth, there being no light and
whistle to guide the captains. It has been
supposed impossible to put even a buoy on
Hatteras Shoal, since the saw-teeth (as the
peculiar sea is called) chafe the chains off in a
short time. My plan (which I have placed
before the most competent engineers of the
country and which is by them pronounced
practical) is for an iron structure to be built on
shore, launched, ballasted, towed to place and
sunk, forming an immense diving-bell in which
the sand pumps can be worked to sink the
structure into the sand, forming a solid
foundation.

"After working on these plans for a number
of years, I went to Washington and made
application for a patent, but it did not go to
issue at that time. When I finally found that
my patents could be allowed, I showed them
to the engineer of the Lighthouse Board, and
am sorry to tell you that he looked at me as
though he considered me a mcddler, inter-
fering with the work of the Lighthouse Board.

"I then went to see Governor Dingley, he
being then the Representative from my district,

FOR HATTERAS

and he wrote me a letter of introduction to
Commodore Greer, who was the chairman of
the Lighthouse Board. He received me
very kindly, promised to do all he could, and
then introduced me to the Engineer Secretary,
Mr. John Millis.

"I went to see Mr. Millis at his office, and
said to him:

"'I have a plan for building a lighthouse on
sandy foundations, and a letter from Repre-
tative Dingley.'

" 'Mr. Eells, I would rather you would not
trouble Hatteras,' he said, 'as there are other
movements being made at that point. Is there
not some other point where you could plant
your structure? If there is, I will be glad to
cooperate with you.'

" 'Yes,' I said, 'on Pollock Rip, at the em
trance to the shoals off Monomoy, near where
my captain lost my vessel, and who was drowned
with another man who came from my home.
What is the usual procedure in establishing a
new lighthouse? Is it necessary to get a
petition signed ?'

" 'I think something of that kind would be
wcll,' he replied.

"I then got a petition signed by nearly every
commercial interest along the Atlantic coast
and by ship-owners in New York, Boston, and
Baltimore, for a lighthouse to be built at Pollock
Rip. I laid this petition before the engineers,
but never heard anything more from it.

"I finally took the drawings to New York
and showed them to Abner McKinley, the
President's brother, and through Mr. McKinley
I met Admiral Schley, who was then chairman
of the Lighthouse Board.

"He looked the drawings over, spoke well
of the plans and said, 'I will do what I can for
you in having this idea carried out.' All the
naval men whom I met during this effort were
strongly in favor of, and very much pleased with,
my project; but, to counteract this, I am sorry
to say that I had continuous opposition from
the army engineers, who were the engineering
officers of the Lighthouse Board.

"Admiral Wilde, whom I had previously met
when he was Naval Secretary of the Light-
house Board, always showed great pleasure
in promoting my project. I consider him to
be my first friend in the Government employ
to endorse this project.

"I used a great deal of time in getting
signed this petition for the appropriation of
$300,000 for a lighthouse at Pollock Rip,
