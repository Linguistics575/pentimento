of the Western Pacific, are just as were the
"roaring" camps of the last generation, save
that they lack Bret Harte. The engineers
still lose themselves in the deep snow, perish
by falls from the cliffs, are swept away by the
strong rivers. The "company boarding
houses" along the Sierra still serve their patrons
with bacon, beans, and hard black bread, the
only noticeable difference being that nowadays
the weekly charge for the same is $5 in-
stead of $1.50. The den, the dance-hall,
the saloon still cast their lurid lights across the
midnight camp in the rift of the snow-capped
Rockies, where the army of "jim" Hill is
fighting the cliffs of the Columbia to build that
anomalous "water-grade" through the very
heart of the great mountains.

But, with all their crudity and cruelty, the
forces gain their end. There is no mountain
range on the whole American Continent that
can to-day strike terror to the heart of the man
with the transit and the level.

Though ropes will break, men will take long
chances so long as the world endures. A one-inch
rope once frayed out along the verge of the Gum.

ness, a misstep, a tumble, a cry from the black
ravine-and the songs in the camp are hushed

against the rocks and swung a bridge to cmy the line"

that night. But the spirits of the pioneers are
elastic, and the work brings swift forgetfulness.
