that has ever expressod itself, perhaps, at any
state capital, this is truly an historic event.

The new law gives two commissions, of five
members each (one for New York City and
the other for the rest of the state), as complete
regulative power over all public-service cor-
porations, except telegraph and telephone
companies, as any law, state or Federal, has
ever given. It is fair to call it the most com-
prehensive and ,serious effort at state regulation
yet made in any of the older states. If its
intent is carried into effect, as there is every
reason to suppose that it will be, the era of
franchise-built politics and tyranny, as well as
of diseriminations and of imperfect public
service, will close. The agitation for the
regulation of public-service corporations has
produced no other result so definite and
promising.

The fundamental principle of the law is
that the people must at all times and in all
places be superior to the creatures of the
pcople's making. No corporation must be
able to snap its fingers in the face of the people
who created it. That is a principle. eternally
right, and upon which no compromise should
be possible. Because the state of New York
has compromised upon it in the past many and
many a time, the present Public Utilities law
was necessary.

Now enters the second consideration-the
question of how this control is to be exercised.
The legislature of the state has again and again
demonstrated beyond question that it has
neither the ability nor the honesty properly to
exercise a duty so complex. In fact, no lcgisr
lature in the land is so constituted as to be a
proper body to undertake direct supervision
over a huge, complex, and stubborn machine
such as, for instance, the traction system of
New York City.

What is to be the result? If one asks the
financial powers, they frown and look signify
cant, and point out that Mr. Ryan has sailed
for Europe after trimming his sails-or rather
stripping his poles completely-in preparation
for the storm. Their attitude, in fact, recalls
the attitude of the railroad powers when Presi-
dent Roosevelt came out against the Northern
Securities Company, and, later, in favor of
rate regulation. But these "radical and un-
safe" policies of Mr. Roosevelt have been fol,
lowed by tremendous advances in the prices of
railroad stocks, even those directly attacked.
Wall Street, in truth, is a discredited judge.

THAT FAILS

The people rejoice that at last there is to be
some semblance of an effort to see that when
the people give life to these great corporations
the companies shall live up to their part of the
bargain. And in the hope that practical
results will be obtained, the people smile at
Wall Street and its walls, and go about their
business well content with Governor Hughes
and the triumph that he gains.

A LIGHT THAT FAILS

THE railroad companies and other great
corporations used, as a rule, to ignore
"the making of public opinion." But, when
the agitation began for rate-regulation, must
of the great railroad companies created " literary
bureaus" or contributed to their support.
All kinds of periodicals were flooded with
articles and with arguments. â€˜f Special writers,"

"economists," "experts''-all sorts of men
became active with their pens, at the railroads'
expense.

Then other large corporations followed this
example. Nearly every one now has its "press
agent," a man, or a pair of men, who are kept
in its service to give out information to public
journals. There come to this desk almost
every day neatly typewritten or printed pieces
of information from such men. Most of this
is olTered free and some of these news-firms
frankly say that they are paid by their " clients."
But articles are offered also by writers who are
not so frank-men who were paid to go to
Cuba or to some part of the country through
which a new railroad runs. They also have
their "clients." And there are "news-firms"
who send correspondents or reporters any-
where or everywhere to describe anything if
their "clients" pay the bill-ideal life in a
manufacturing town, the failure of municipal
ownership in some Western village, the cleanli-
ness of a canning factory, the kindly rule on
the Congo-anything, anywhere.

Much of this ready-made, or "tainted"
news and description and argument is pub-
lished in some journals, some of it because it is
interesting, more of it because it is cheap.
Some of it is true, some of it is false, most of
it is neither true nor false but merely "molly-
coddle" stuff without character. You read
it in many newspapers and in some magazines.
You probably do not know that it is "tainted,"
but you do know that it is inane.

The truth is, a writer who writes for a "client"
can never earn his fees, however small they
