THE SECRETS OF THE MOSQUITO

boring ship in a fog, was familiar with this
gnat mechanism? With perpetuation of his
kind insured, the male mosquito shortly dies;
the widowed female, within a couple of days,
will deposit her quota of posthumous eggs in
the form of an "egg-boat" on the placid sur-
face of some neighboring pool-and so the
vicious circle of mosquito perpetuation is
complete.

Clear knowledge of the divisions of this
cycle of mosquito life, the time spent as egg,
larva, pupa, and mosquito, is necessary in our
efforts at extermination of the pests; and the
face of a clock affords a simple mnemonic.
Consider each hour of the clock as representing
one day in mosquito development. From
XII around to XII will be twelve days,
divided as follows: From egg-laying at XII
to II o'c'is--Cwo days, hatching of the larvae;
from II to VU-five days, change of the larvae
into pupae; from VII to X-thrs days, birth
of the mosquitoes; and from X to Xu-two
days, deposit of eggs by the "new" mosquitoes.
This division of time represents an average,
there being many variations; warm weather
and abundance of food hasten development,
while their opposites retard it.

Such, in brief, are the conspicuous family
secrets of the great little enemies of man-
the mosquitoes. Far more interesting and
important from our human standpoint are the
why. and wherefore of malaria and yellow fever,
now known to result from mosquito bites and
only from them. Suspicion began to fasten on
mosquitoes in general as responsible for human
malaria back 2,000 years ago. But since
only two branches of this great family of over
a hundred clans could inoculate man, because
the microscopic tools were lacking; and
because the peculiar problems of bacteriology
are the most difrscult in the world to solve, it
took centuries to reach a verdict-tho) it
required but six years when modern methods
of investigation were applied. Why the anophelcs
only can given us malaria, and the stegomyia
holds a similar monopoly on yellow fever, is a
question that involves the fundamental fact
inbacteriology-immurlitr And the simplest
answer to this is, that-just as cows grow on
grass, tigers on meat, vultures on "high"
carrion, and man on every conglomeration
under the sun-so certain spores, bacteria,
micro-organisms, and fungi can thrive on certain
foods only; and when an anophelina mosquito
bites a man whose blood is at a certain stage of

malarial fever, it will take in and hold in its
stomach forms of malarial germs which will
thrive because they will find food in the anophe-
les only on which they can develop. There
is thus a difference in the nutritive material
between one family of mosquitoes and another.
Then, in from one to two weeks, this anopheles
rascal, if he bites a healthy man, will insert the
malarial parasite; this will multiply in the
manâ€™s blood until, if a healthy anophelese
innocent bites him, there will be yet another
mosquito armed with the germ. And this is
the "vicious circle" of give and take. Which
side started it we know not, but man must get
his malarial inoculation from some member of
the anopheles family, which has in her turn
been foolish enough to draw blood from some
human being whose blood, was in active ferment
from the disease.

Yellow fever yields similar facts-the Sieg-
omyia fasciala being in this case cup-bearer to
King Yellow Jack. Along the Atlantic coast
the most common variety of mosquito is the
Culex solicitatss, which breeds in swamps.
The little fellows who can "osmose" through
the meshes of mosquito netting are the Culex
pipiens, who much affect rain-water barrels
and rooi-tanks, water which cannot be treated
with antisepties, as it is used for drinking pur-
poses. Any kind of mosquito may cause blood-
poisoning by accidentally carrying septic mat-
ter on his "hypodermic needle," but the
anopheles and stegomyia are the old families
holding proprietary rights in the distribution
of definite parasitic diseases in our part of the
world.

EXTERMINATION OF THE PESTS

Three brief clauses will just about state the
whole method of destroying mosquitoes whole-
sale and efficiently. Drain all standing waters
or iill in depressions; screen all waters kept for
domestic uses; and keep crude petroleum on
all cess-pools. Mosquito larvae can develop only
in water, and the time-clock shows how long
the water must stand to breed from eggs to
flying mosquitoes. The great mosquito fae-
tories--the swamps-are not difficult to render
sterile. They can be drained at a cost of about
$1.50 an acre. Mosquito larvae cannot thrive
in rapidly running water, their hold on the
surface in breathing being broken until they
suffocate; and they cannot survive in tide-
waters flowing in and out of inlets and ditches.
