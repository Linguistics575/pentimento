Europe, until recent years, was an amusement
of the lid] or the business of merchants or the
amLition of students. Now men who have
no "busincss" to transact go as a recreation;
teachers in the public schools go-evcrybody
goes. Perhaps a million passengers (exclusive
of the steerage) have gone from all the ports
of the United States and Canada to Europe
during the last twelve months, or about one out
of every 160 of our total population.

An English man-of-letters recently wrote:
"The time is coming when a large part of
Europe will become the play-ground and a
large part of the business of the people of our
old countrics will be to amuse and to instruct
visitors from iiehcr and newer lands."

While this stream of American travel to
Europe flows strong, stronger than ever flows
also the stream of immigration from Europe.
Italy and some of the Scandinavian countries
are bewailing the drain of their population and
are trying to forbid it and are talking even of
trying to reverse it. Still in almost all parts of
the Lnited States the cry for men becomes more
insistent. The number of abandoned farms
--n0t in New England but in New York-has
become so great for the lack of farm-labor that
a convention is to be held to discuss remedies.

In the meantime, too, Mr. J. Pierpont
Morgan and other men of taste and fortune are
buying great collections of artistic things in
Europe for the enrichment of American life.

A PROBABLE CURE FOR MENINGITIS

HE announcement-premature, perhaps---
that a cure for cerebrospinal meningitis
has been discovered by Dr. Simon Flcxncr, of
the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research,
is especially gratifying. Since 1905, when
there were something like 4,000 cases of menin-
gitis in New York City, three of every four
proving fatal, Dr. Flexner has been experi-
menting in the hope of developing a serum
that would do for this disease what the diptheria
antitoxin has done for that disease. That he
succeeded has for some time been the belief
of his associates, but it is not the custom of the
Institute to publish its hopes, or even its beliefs.
Though no official endorsement of the report
has yet come, it is reasonable to hope that a
cure has been found.

However well-founded the report may prove
to be, it is well for the public to be conservative
in its expectations. Until Dr. Flexner shall
himself announce to the medical profession

THE MARCH OF EVENTS

that a cure has been found, there must remain
a measure of doubt. A serum of this kind is
the product of development, and is not a mere
"discovery"; time must therefore elapse before
we may expect it to reach perfection.

Even then, we must recognize the difficulty
in the way of its universal application. In
the case of diphtheria, the injection of the
antitoxin is such a simple operation that any
physician of ordinary intelligence may admin-
ister it successfully. But meningitis attacks
the very citadel of life-the lower part of the
brain and the spinal cord. If rumor be correct,
the Flexner serum must be injected into the
area affected-and only an expert or a reckless
physician thrusts his needle into the spinal
cord or the meninges of the brain.

But cerebro-spinal meningitis is such a
terrible disease-both in respect to its death-
rate and the sufferings of its victims-that we
welcome any method that brings even a promise
of cure. Physicians the world over have
experimented with every drug that might
logically do good, only to fall back on the treat-
ment of its worst symptom-the horrible pain.
The main hope in every case has been that a
mistake may have been made in the diagnosis.
The chief hope now is that the patient work
of Dr. Flexner has been rewarded.

At any rate, here is reason for public apprecia-
tion of scientific medicine, as represented by
the Rockefeller Institute.

It is a curious and most hopeful fact that
while hospitals are becoming larger and more
numerous and while the medical colleges are
turning out more doctors every year, scientific
medicine is working along lines that logically
limit the physician's field. Smallpox, once
so dreaded, now makes small demand on his
time; one physician can quickly give immunity
to an entire village. Diphtheria is usually cut
short in a community by the use of its anti-
toxin. Yellow-fever is largely reduced to the
simple enforcement of medical regulations.
Malaria also seems to be on the way to exter-
mination; it has fed many a physician's family
in certain sections. Tetanus, sleeping-sickness,
and a number of other distressing maladies
have reached the same stage as meningitis,

But tuberculosis and cancer yet persist, in all
their fearful ravages. Typhoid fever, when sani,
tation fails, is still mainly a question of careful
nursing. And yet, there is not a physician of
middle life who does not expect some day to
administer a specific cure for these diseases.
