9354 TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

border to border. One morning there rushed
in upon the Judge's secretary a haggard and
feverish man. He was attorney for the ap-
pellants, and he wanted to see the Judge. He
had not slept, he said, because just too late he
had remembered that he should have filed his
papers for an appeal the day before. His
time had expired, and he almost knew that for
his negligence his case would be thrown out,
though it was at the discretion of the Judge to
extend the time. Judge Taft, whom he had
never seen, had not yet come. But what kind
of a man was the Judge, he asked anxiously.
The secretary smiled and asked him to wait
patiently. He waited, but not patiently. He
did not dare expect leniency. At last, the
secretary heard a whistling down the corridor,
someone whistling "My Country."

"That' s the Judge now," said the secretary.
"He always whistles that. "

Then there entered Cincinnati' s lovable
citizen, smiling and happy, as he always was.
The uneasy attorney stammeringly intro-
duced himself.

"Why," exclaimed the Judge, "I was afraid
that you were going to let that case go by
default. But I'm glad you came, sir. Got
your papers ready?‚Äù

The dumfounded lawyer did not know his
papers from his hat. He could not believe his
cars. But in less time than he would have
taken in explaining, his papers were accepted,
the case set, and the lawyer's mind set at rest.
On his way out he stopped at the secretary's
desk. "What a man he isl" he murmured.
"Another judge would have thrown my case
out. Oh, what a man he is!"

A JUDGE UNAFFECTED BY INFLUENCE"

Once, in a bank case, Judge Taft decided
against ex-District Attorney Herron, his father-
in-law. It is said that the old gentleman was
exceedingly wroth over that decision. He was
positive that he was right. But Judge Taft only
laughed, and Mr. Herron appealed. And his
son-in-law was sustained.

Judge Taft as serenely went against his own
party. During the Goebel troubles in Kerr
tucky, suit was brought in his court by the
Republicans to get their man declared Gover,
nor. But Lawrence Maxwell, on the other side,
raised the point that the Federal Courts had no
jurisdiction. Judge Taft found the point well
taken, and sent the case back to the Kentucky
state courts. There were many Republicans

who thought that Judge Taft might have
strained this point for the sake of the party.

Perhaps the hardest task of all was for a man
of Taft's sensitive delicacy to maintain his
independence on the Bench even against the
seeming exactions of hospitality. In 1897-8,
before the present good times, five or six Ohio
railroads were in receivers' hands. Judge
Taft heard that some of these receivers were
permitting rebates, and he summoned them
before him. Among them was Myron T.
Herrick, later Governor of Ohio. Mr. Herrick
and Judge Taft were old friends. It was
Taft who had appointed Herrick to one of the
receiverships. On arriving in Cincinnati, Mr.
and Mrs. Herrick were most cordially enter-
tained by Judge and Mrs. Tait. The next
day Mr. Herrick went to the Judge's office on
the business in hand.

"Myron," asked the Judge, "have you been
rebating?"

Herrick laid down a statement showing
some $80,000 that had been paid to shippers.

The Judge was visibly shocked. He looked
so stern that Herrick quaked before him.

"Myron," he said, "if you have done this
thing, you cannot be permitted to csrape."

On the Bench, he was no longer "Bill"
Tait. He sustained the dignity of the Court,
and it is declared that he was hardest on his
friends. Luckily for Mr. Herrick, the $80,000
had been paid because of a moral obligation
to the shippers, an obligation inherited by the
receivership that could not in justice be evaded.
For Mr. Herrick, it was a manner of paying
off a debt that had been contracted, and was
not rebating at all.

The Judge gave a great sigh of relief.
"Well, that is different," he said, and after a
little there was his jolly laugh again. "Please
hereafter let me settle judicial questions," he
added. "I will enter an order for the payment
of these claims, which are unquestionably just.
You have taken a great load off my mind, for
I should not have liked to convict you of
rebating."

When the receivership of this railroad was
applied for, Judge Taft declined to appoint
anyone connected with the road, or interested
in it even, though a certain man was urged by
ex-President Harrison. It was then that Mr.
Herrick was named. This indicates an abso-
lute impartiality when dealing with public
questions.
