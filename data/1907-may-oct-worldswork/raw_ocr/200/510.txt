THE UNITED STATES IN PORTO RICO

of it, are fitting up their homes with more of
the comforts of modern timcs, are buying
machinery and tools that will increase their
productive power. The figures show that the
people bought more breadstuffs, twice as much
codfish, twice as large a quantity of vegetables,
more than twice as much meat and dairypro-
ducts. It suggests a happier state of existence,
for example, in the case of a poor tenant I
once saw on the trail northwest of Coamo.
It was Sunday morning and he had evidently
been to a small country store a mile or two
from his hut, to get supplies for his Sunday
dinner. He was bareheaded, barefooted, and
clothed in garments of cheap cotton cloth. In
one hand he carried a small piece of codfish;
in the other was a large yam potato. Ex,
perience had already taught me that this food
supply was for no ordinary occasion.

In the last five years, Porto Rico's clothing
bill has increased about fsfty per cent. and
much of the clothing has gone to the classes
that needed it the most. The people have
bought four times as much furniture, more
than four times as much of things made of
iron and steel, and nearly every ship brings
over one or more automobiles.

When we turn to the things which the island
has produced and sold, the facts are equally

encouraging. Dr Willoughby says that the
value of the exports for last year was nearly
three times as much as in 1901, so it is easy
to see that the income of the farmer is incrcar
ing, and this means a rise in wages for the la-
boring class. The best year the island ever had
under Spanish rule was 1896, yet Porto Rico
did twice as much business last year. And
it is somewhat gratifying to know that most
of this business came to us and that the pro-
ducts were shipped in American bottoms.
We sent to Porto Rico last year eight times as
much as we sent in 1898 (troops excepted),
and one-fourth as much as we sold in all the
markets of South Amcrica.

TEACHING THE PLANTERS NEW TRICKS

The American in the role of a teacher of
tropical farming seems an anomaly, but the
results of his teaching speak for themselves.
Take the sugar planter first, since sugar is
king in Porto Rico. We have taught the large
planter the economy of using steam-plows
instead of oxen; he has thus increased his
acreage. New methods of irrigation have
opened up districts that once were unprofitable
for cane. Great sugar "centrals" costing
millions of dollars, with machinery for grinding
the cane of a thousand acres, have shoved into
