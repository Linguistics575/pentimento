In the foreground, on the right, are Isaiah "I'. Montgomery and the town constable

returned to the plantation and in 1866 put
himself in communication with Mr. Davis.
Very soon they had perfected plans with him
for the purchase of the Hurricane and Brier,
held plantations, containing something like
4,000 acres of land, upon which the elder
Montgomery and his sons, under the name of
Montgomery & Sons, conducted the third
largest plantation in the state.

It was the desire of Joseph Davis, after the
war, to keep together as far as possible the
slaves who had grown up on his plantations.
His notion was, no doubt, that the interests
of all concerned demanded that there should be
just as little break in the old relations as
possible and that the transition from slavery
to freedom should be made gradually, with
the idea that the freedmen should, however,
eventually become the owners of the land
upon which they had previously been slaves.
The plantations were conducted with this entl
in view until 1880, when it became apparent

to the Montgomerys that unless there was a
modification of the terms upon which the pro-
ject had been left to them after Joseph Davisâ€™s
death, it would be impossible to succeed. The
heirs could not agree to an alteration in
terms, and so the scheme was tinally aban-
cloned,

It was with the same notion of carrying out,
under new conditions, the plan which his
father and his former master had formed
years before, that, in 1887, Mr. Montgomery--
as he says in a brief autohiogruphy-"sought
to begin anew, at the age of forty, the dream
of life's young manhood," the dream of doing
something to build up the fortunes ofhis race.
It thus appears that the history of Mound
Bayou is deeply rooted in the past, and is,
in a certain sense, a carrying out ofthe scheme
formulated by the elder 11ontgomcry and his
former master for the welfare of that master's
former slaves. Others than were inttndetl

have become heirs to the plans of these men,
