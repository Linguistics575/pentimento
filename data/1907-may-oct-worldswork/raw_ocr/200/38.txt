late Shah taking a water cure in France, of
the Queen of Roumania, of the steamship
Panto, of a steel magnate and his tiancée, and

reproduction of it, three and a half feet high
by two feet wide, the following Sunday. To
get a certain view of the East River, a photog-
rapher walked, with an outfit of cameras
and plate boxes, up a cable of the Brooklyn
Bridge to the top of one of the towers. Another,
