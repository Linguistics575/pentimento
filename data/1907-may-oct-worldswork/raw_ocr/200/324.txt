appreciative of noble sentiment wrought into
marble and bronze, or made luminous upon
canvas, or infused into exquisite handicrafts.

Perhaps, though, the work of husbanding
the legacy of the past gives us a still more
practical suggestion. Throughout the country
the Government prevents the decay of beauty.
Witness its guardianship of the ramparts of
Aigues-Mortes, the mediaeval city from which
St. Louis set forth with his Crusaders. Witness
also its restoration of the towered walls of
Carcassonne. You might name scores of other
cases in which relics of bygone ages arc saved
from ruin, notably the work now in progress
at Avignon, where the palace of the Pope is
re-assuming its ancient glory. And the Gov-
ernment's campaign finds allies in associations
of private citizens, especially in the Touring
Club of France, which is at once a rebuke to
our heedlessness in letting old landmarks pass
away and to our inability as yet to make those
that remain as accessible as they ought to be.

Several years ago, the Touring Club under-
took to teach Frenchmen to know France.
Wherever there was an ancient town or a his-
toric site or a magnificent bit of scenery, it
insisted upon its preservation and upon an
easy and agreeable excursion to it. At vast
expense, it repaired out-of-the-way roads and
bridges, cut paths where none had been, built
railings where desirable, and courted the
response of the tourist. But he, having al-
ready some knowledge of country hotels,

replied, "The only outs are the irms"; where-
upon the Club set about improving those
delinquent hostclries. When a proprietor de-
clared it would not pay to modernize his
establishment, since guests were so few, he
was met with an assurance that if he would
do his part the Club would send guests in plenty.
And it did. By crying up the charms of the
place, it made good hotel accommodations
profitable-why should they not be, when you
remember the Touring Club of France has
100,000 members? If we had an organiza-
tion like the French. Instead of crossing
the ocean for our vacation travels, we should
begin to know the lovely scenery, the historic
landmarks, and the quaint and curious nooks
of our own country, most of which are at
present neglected because accessible only at
the price of extreme discomfort.

Such, then, are the practical lessons, big and
little, that France can teach us. A further
lesson, of purely sentimental value but im-
portant for all that, is the lesson of under-
standing the real Franco-of seeing the best
elements in the nation arrayed against alcohol-
ism, against pornography, against vice, and
against the many follies and weaknesses we
have so shallowly and unjustly called French.
They exist in France, just as they exist here
to a greater or lesser degree, yet they no more
represent the true genius of the country than
the aberrations of Pittsburg millionaires repre-
sent the genius of America.

corporation and the law do not interfere with

the work he performs is high-grade service,
and it commands a high price.

a corporation, a well-trained specialist should
