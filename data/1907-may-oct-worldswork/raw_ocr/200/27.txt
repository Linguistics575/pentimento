tested these forty years-his wisdom in leaving
the fund to be administered by a board of
public-spirited men, without conditions except
his indication of the general use to which it
should be put; and the members of the
board have, of course, served without com-
pensation. They have administered it more
usefully than the donor himself could have
spent it for this purpose in his lifetime; for a
self-perpetuating board of high-minded men
can fit their action to changing conditions,
year by year, decade by decade.

Mr. Peabody's example was followed in
1882 by Mr. John F. Slater, who gave
$1,000,000 to be used for the education of
Negroes. Of this fund, the income, which
has now exceeded the principal, has
been wisely applied-much more wisely ap-
plied than it would have been if it had been
given by any one man for whatever specific
institutions he could have thoroughly in-
vestigated in his lifetime. The unexpended
part of this fund is now about $1,700,000.
Its increase is due largely to the efficient ad-
ministration of Mr. Morris K. Jesup, the
treasurer.

This example was, in turn, followed by Mr.
Carnegie when he established, by a gift of
$10,000,000, the Carnegie Institution for the
promotion of research. Again a board of
distinguished men was found to give their
time and thought to discover most fruitful
uses of this money.

Then Mr. John D. Rockefeller adopted the
same plan when he gave first $1,000,000 to be
used in furthering education in the South; to
which he added $10,000,000 for furthering
higher education throughout the United States,
and subsequently (in February of this year,
just forty years to a day after the gift of George
Peabody was made) $32,000,000 more for the
same large purpose-making a total of
343,000,000, the income of $42,000,000 of
which is administered for education by the
General Education Board, without restrictions
or conditions; and members of this self-per-
petuating board, of course (as of all the similar
boards), do this public service without corn-
pensation.

Mr. Carnegie made another foundation-
following the same plan of administration-
of $10,000,000 for the compensation of college-
teachers of long and honorable service. The
latest of the now lengthening list of these
munificent foundations, made on this same

principle, is the fund of $10,000,000 for the
betterment of conditions of living made by
Mrs. Russell Sage.

Not to speak of many lesser gifts, these
make six great foundations which comprise
an original principal of $75,000,000 devoted
to the public welfare, released on the instant
the gifts were made from all control or in-,
fluence by their donors and administered by
men who give their time and thought to the
work from love of their fellows; and all these
great bcnefactions are unaccompanied by any
conditions except an indication by the donors
of the large purposes for which they are to be
used.

These important boards are, in a sense,
a new sort of the machinery of civilization.
They are neither political nor ecclesiastical.
They exist, each for its own purpose and for
nothing else, without obligations or entangle-
ments; and they are all sclf-pcrpctuating.
They have, in varying degrees, as the purpose
of each requires, thorough organizations;
and they go about their work of bettering the
conditions of life, of broadening human
knowledge, and of strengthening and extend-
ing education as systematically as the best
business organizations do their business tasks.

A POSSIBLE NEW ERA IN MEDICINE

IGH hopes are held by an increasing
number of distinguished physicians of
what promises to be a rcvolutionary system
both of curative and preventive treatment
of a large number of diseases. Sir Almroth
Edward Wright, a distinguished English in,
vestigator and physician, who has had much to
do with its application, has declared that
"we have, in the power of raising the anti,
bacterial power of the blood with respect to
any invading microbe, out of all comparison
the most valuable asset in medicine."

For that is the mcthod-to increase the
resisting power of the blood against the. in-
vading disease. The philosophy of the treat-
ment is simple-delicate and dillicult as its
application is. The white corpuscles of the
blood devour invading disease germs -that
is their function. When they are equal to
this task, the attacked person escapes the
disease. When the disease germs overpower
the white corpuscles, the attacked person
"takes" the disease. The new treatment is
so to fortify and strengthen these white cor-
puscles that they shall be equal to the task of
