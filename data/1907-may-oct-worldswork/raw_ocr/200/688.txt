are professional politicians. The Lords are
not, and the people are not. What subtle
sympathy exists between this pair of sluggards
as against their virtuous brother is too deep a
matter to examine. But that the Lords are
strong, that the professional political attack on
them is failing to make way, that their glamor
attracts, their sober virtues flatter, their stolid
obstruction secretly gratifies the hidden in
stincts of Englishmen, are facts which anyone
can see. They do not share the enthusiastic
popularity of the monarchy, but it could safely
be said that their abolition would be felt by

common Englishmen to be rather like the
abolition of the game of cricket. It would
be, first, "a pity," secondly, "ashame."

These observations must be taken to refer to
those rare occasions when the Lords assemble
in their hundreds and assert themselves as a
chamber of veto. Only then is the hereditary
element in particular evidence. At other
times, the second chamber drifts through a
smooth existence, a very honest group of politi-
cal experts, more useful than harmful, precisely
what the English Constitution demands and
makes convenient.

WHEN TO USE A LAWYER

LEGAL ADVICE AT THE RIGHT TIME TO AVOID SUITS AND TO LESSEN COST

, I IHE average man consults the lawyer at
the wrong time. Not so the ex-
perienced business man. He knows

that good business principle requires that no

unnecessary chances of loss should be taken,
and that prevention is far less costly than
remedy. The captain of industry embarks on
no undertaking, however slight, without secure
ing the services of a skilful counsellor as his
pilot. In fact, he has under retainer at all
times one or more attorneys who are familiar
with his business affairs and interested in his
success. He makes no agreements and signs
no papers until approved by a legal expert.

This is exactly the course that every one should

pursue.

Business has to-day become an art, and in,
vestment has become an art; without special
knowledge, no one should expect to succeed in
either, and part of this knowledge consists in
the ability to correctly use legal services. The
lawyer is to-day a factor in everyday life. His
main business is not to get people out of trouble,
but to prevent them from getting in. Business
and personal relations have become so complex
and the boundary between one man's rights and
another man's duties is so indistinct to the
average person that, with the best intentions in
the world, he or she may cause considerable
loss to himself, herself, or somebody else. The
individual-as employer, employee, director,
trustee, executor, guardian, husband, wife, land-
lord, tenant, buyer, and seller-has assumed
obligations unknown to earlier times. To

properly fulfil these obligations, usually im,
plies the assistance of good counsel or of good
fortune.

It is the business of the lawyer not only to
ascertain the Jaw but to attain skill in applying
it. He has before him a very complete record
of past success and past failure, running back
through many centuries and compiled from the
decisions of all the state and Federal courts, as

well as the courts of Great Britain, not to speak.

of the Roman and Continental law whose appli-
cation to this country is remote. All the im.
portant cases decided are reported by experts
and digested by experts. These reports and
digests are published at frequent intervals and
form the bulk of the practicing attorney's
library. From these he gains by the experience
of his profession at many times and in many
places, and naturally can foresee the contin-
gencies that usually arise on any cour√©e of
conduct. In no science are more careful and
numerous records preserved, and in no lines
of action are more skill and care according to the
circumstances applied to the production of
desired results, than in the law.

WHEN BUYING REAL-ESTATE

It would seem superfluous to remind a pur-
chaser of real-estate that the title should be ex-
amined before conveyance. Experience, how-
ever, shows that this rule by some 'will always
be neglected. Carelessness in this respect is
sometimes appalling. In one case on record,

a tract of land was divided into blocks and city'
