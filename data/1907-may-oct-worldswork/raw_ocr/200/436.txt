THE CONTROL OF DESTRUCTIVE FERMENTS

Every vital process, whether it be the ab-
sorption of oxygen by the blood corpuscles in
the lungs, or the digestion of starches, or the
abstraction of urea from the blood by the
kidneys, or repair of the body in any way, is
secured through the action of ferments. Ordi-
narily, ferments arc destructive; but brilliant
discoveries have shown the existence of con-
structive ferments. Every one knows that a
large dose of certain drugs will poison, while
small amounts stimulate. Ferments behave
in the same way. Add malt to starch and it
will become glucose. Add sugar to this and
it will change back to starch.

The nature of these physiological ferments
is largely a mystery at the present time; but
some of them are being chemically imitated,
and the next step will be to learn how so to
balance the constructive against the destructive
ferments in the body that, instead of pro-
gressive decay of the upbuilding cells by de-
stroying ferments, they can continue equalizing
loss and repair. Aside from the destructive
iniluence of certain ferments, there is apparently
no limit in the years of growth capacity of
cells, which is another great mystery. Possibly
the gradual weakening of the body is not due
to an increase in the amount of destructive
ferments, but to a weakening production of the
constructive ferments. The lines of attack
will not materially change. Nature is nowhere
so prodigal as in her supply of reproductive
cells, and for every being created there are
thousands of such cells destroyed. Under wild
conditions, a large percentage of fruits and
berries produced fall in early decay, or remain
stunted. The skilful horticulturist can work
such adjustments through ferments as greatly to
avoid such failures and add to the quality of
the total crop. What could be accomplished
with man, if he could be bred and trained under
the same "controls" that are so successfully
applied with fine stock?

It is evident that one of the pivotal points
is the meaning of the word fermentation, for in
it lie many of the fundamental problems of
Physio-chemistry. A whole page might be
filled with dufinitions of the word. We might

say that it is the perpetual quest of matter for
an equilibrial rest that is never sustained-
naturally not sustained, for equilibrium is
never a state of rest. The crane can sleep on
one leg, but his muscles are in constant tension.
All particles of matter are very positive in their
tendency either to unite, or to ily apart. That
is probably the ultimate electrical status of all
matter. These particles are more or less bound
up in temporary wedlock, but constantly sub-
jected to temptation to divorce through the
machinations of the ferments.

Ferments hold somewhat the same relation
to combinations of matter that a trigger holds
to the charge in a gun. Just why a given
element, that which acts as a ferment, should
so act-we do not know. Hydrogen and
oxygen will dwell together in perfect harmony,
work together, sleep in the same bed; but the
instant the slightest bit of platinum sponge
crawls into the bed, there is a violent explosion.
Why? As the honest pupil says: "Teacher,
that's as far as my lesson goes."

In the world of living matter the development
of ferments is universal, and it is caused either
by bacteria-them/es created by it-or
through the specialized secretions of various
glands. Bacteria hold this unique relation to
our lives, that too much of them means death,
and too little of them means death. Evi-
dently the delicacy of the situation calls for
much tact and diplomacy in adjustment.

CAN THE LIFE PROCESSES BE REVERSED?

We cannot conceive of time running back-
ward, but many machines can do so; and,
strange to relate, certain living creatures have
shown the whole process of upbuilding reversed.
Likewise, it was discovered by Hill that the
ferments are reversible and can make a given
process retrace its ground. Here is another
"basic principle" discovered. Now, from this
shall we picture the old man looking less
wrinkled, to-morrow, straightening up in his
walk, brightening in his dull eye, steadying
in his quaking hand, filling the hollowed cheek
and neck, discarding the past for the future
tense, moving from year to year backward
into the bloom of elasticity, hopefulness, enthu-
siaim, and freshness of youth; and shall we
run riot in our imaginings and follow this
glowing youthdom into the perspective of
babyhood until it passes out of focal gaze?
Or shall we run yet more riot and picture the
lever thrown to its centre-life change brought
