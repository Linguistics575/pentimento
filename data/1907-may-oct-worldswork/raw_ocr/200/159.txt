THE RAILROAD ENTERPRISES OF THE SOUTH

management of the interests represented by
Mr. Thomas F. Ryan and Mr. James Blair, has
recently announced an intention to spend in
the next few years many millions of dollars for
improvements, but there are few important
extensions now under way. In Florida, the
aggression of the Atlantic Coast Line has
forced this road into one important line, and
there is another small spur under contempla-
tion. The money that is behind the Seaboard
Air Line is what is called in WallStreet " canny
money," which means that the system will
proceed very slowly in its development, with,
out taking any unnecessary risks.

Mr. Harrimanâ€™s Illinois Central is carrying
on one important extension begun under the
Fish administration. It is a new line from
Corinth, Miss., to Haleyville, Ala., where it
connects with the St. Louis & San Francisco,
which lets the Illinois Central into Birming-
ham, Ala. The new line is about eighty miles
in length. Its importance lies in the fact that
it adds another railroad to the big group that
centres about Birmingham, which has had a
wonderful growth in railroad life as its iron and
coal industries have advanced. The railroad
kings are trying to read the future of Birming-
ham, and each of them concludes that he must
have a line into that city, no matter what it
costs.

In general, the work of the big systems is
not of striking importance. It will be seen
that it consists mainly of building only what
the roads are practically forced to build. It
is not too much to say that there is not a single
one of the big roads that is now trying to expand.
The effort is rather to build up the present lines
to a condition that will make it possible for
them to handle the traffic which now swamps
them. The biggest work going on in the South
is the revision of grades, the double-tracking
of crowded divisions, the buying of new ter-
minals, the purchase of new equipment, the
building of new bridges in place of old. If
some good genius were to place at the disposal
of the five big systems of the South $xoo,ooo,ooo
each, they could spend it profitably on these
works without building a single mile of new
railroad. The roads of the South are more
urgently in need of such improvement than
are the roads of any other section of the United
States.

An interesting piece of railroad work being
carried on by one of the smaller lines is the
extension of the Florida East Coast Railway

8957

from Homestead, Fla., southwest, 125 miles
down the Florida Keys to Key West. At the
last report the work had been carried thirty-
seven miles, to the southern end of Key Largo.
The route is designed to shorten the run to
Cuba, and in the mails it will save a great
many hours. Of course, the right of way is
interesting, consisting of a series of short lines
on land connected by long bridges across the
inlets.

The Atlanta, Birmingham, and Atlantic
has been pushing work on its new line from
La Grange, Ga., to Birmingham, 165 miles.
The project also calls for a 77-mile extension
from Chalybeate northward to Atlanta. It
is the formation of a new trunk line from the
two important inland cities to tidewater at
Brunswick, Ga. The enterprise is backed,
largely, by Boston capital, and the financing
has been done, of late, in short-term notes.
This proposition amounts to a new railroad
to rival the Central of Georgia in carrying to
the sea the products of the big manufacturing
towns of the uplands, and to draw down also the
tonnage from the West coming in over the
Southern, the St. Louis & San Francisco, and
the Illinois Central. Relations between this
road and the Y oakum lines are friendly.

By far the most interesting railroad project
in the South, from every point of view, is the
line that has recently been consolidated under
the name of the Virginia Railway. It pierces
a rugged, mountainous country. It crosses
the Pocahontas coal-fields, which produce the
finest grades of bituminous coal for the markets
of the East. It was not expected, at the out-
set, that the new road would be anything but
a logging railroad in the interest of the lumber-
men in that region. As time went on, however,
other interests came in. They decided to push
the road through the mountains and run
alongside the Norfolk & Western to tide-
water, making a new coal railroad from the
Pocahontas fields to Norfolk, Va. The whole
project finally became known as a project
backed largely by Mr. H. H. Rogers, of the
Standard Oil Company.

The western section of the new road is a
heavy bit of work. It twists its way through
the serrated ranges, following a stream here,
plunging through a long tunnel there, climbing
across a giddy trestle over a roaring river to
avoid a mile or so of twisting climb. When
they began to build it, in 1894, they followed
the river course, seeking only such grades as a
