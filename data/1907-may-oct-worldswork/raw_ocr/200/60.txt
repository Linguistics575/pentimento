and that of Mr. Carnegie dominate the business
life of the city that few men there will talk to
you about him. Much of this reticcnce is due
to sheer ignorance, for Mr. Frick has kept his
own counsels most discreetly. 'But much of it,
as one may see from the faces of those one
questions about him, is due to an uneasy sense
of insecurity in talking about a man whose
power penetrates so nearly to every phase of
life of the city. He is in most of the financial
institutions of the city, he is the largest owner
of the city's real estate-his holdings are worth
many millions-he is powerful in steel, he is
one of Pittsburgâ€™s two "great" men, and the
more active of the two.

years, hardly more to him than a branch office,
his shadow falls heavily upon Wall Street.
His tremendous power is known, his intimate
alliances with the other great power of Standard
Oil and with the terrible energy of Harriman
are recognized.

But Mr. Frick has yet the aloofness
of the great commander, of the man able to
stand alone. And there is something of dread
in the mental state of Wall Street regarding
him, for no one knows the final reach of his
ambition, nor the direction of its course. He
is the Silent Man, a mystery. He is a He

THE HONOR OF THE RAILROAD MAN

THE CLEAN-HANDEI) LOYALTY OF THE EMPLOYEES TO THEIR ROADS

BY

C. M. KEYS

EARLY a million and a half of the

N citizens of the United States are in

the employ of the railroads. Out of

every twenty adult males in the country, one
is a railroad employee.

Against these men has arisen in the last two
or three years a general accusation touching
closely upon the personal honor of the entire
class. In every economic text-book concern-
ing the railroad problem, there has been in-
cluded an insinuation-in many cases a direct
statement-that the whole railroad business
is honeycombed with "graft," and depraved
by the lust for personal gain.

The accusation arises out of the long-
continued exposure of the methods of high-
finance in the exploitation of the railroads, the
equally damning evidence with regard to the
unearned increment that has accrued to the
promoters of the railroads, the established
facts with regard to money paid by the rail-
roads for political iniluence, and the equally
well-established charge of favoritism shown
at all times and under all conditions, lawful
and unlawful, to large shippers.

Yet, a very eminent economist has-lately
made the statement that if one scratch the
railroad service anywhere, he reveals "graft."

It is echoed in almost all the magazine and
newspaper comment on railroad matters
throughout the United States. It is there-
fore interesting to note that just at this
moment the "railroad man" has received
a vindication at the hands of a commit-
tee thoroughly well-qualified to issue sucha
vindication.

About a year ago arose a general outburst
of invective directed primarily at the men who
handle the railroad business of the Penn.
sylvania Railroad. It was based upon an
examination made by the Interstate Commerce
Commission into the conduct of a few minor
officials of that railroad in the matter of dis,
tributing cars to shippers. The indictment
spread far beyond the range outlined for it by
that investigation. It became, in fact, a
general indictment of the personal honor of the
American Railroad Man.

The Pennsylvania Railroad appointed a
committee of fwe men to carry on an investiga-
tion. They have just handed down their
report. The committee consisted of Messrs.
C. Stuart Patterson, William H. Barnes,
Effingham B. Morris, Thomas De Witt Cuyler,
and Rudolph Ellis. All are men of a social
and business standing that makes it beyond
