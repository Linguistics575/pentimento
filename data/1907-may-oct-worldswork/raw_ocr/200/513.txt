Belt and label his description "The Southern
People." It may be that the Pprto Rican is
called a "trickster" in other parts of the
Caribbean; the natives from other parts of
the Caribbean are sometimes called by worse
names in Porto Rico. My own experience
has been that the native Porto Rican is, as a
rule, more honest than many classes with
which he has to deal. Half a dozen regiments
landed on his island in 1898, and gave the native
his golden opportunity for trickery. The
soldiers knew nothing then of the value of
Porto Rican currency; they bought things to
eat, handed out an American coin, and took
what change was offered. Gradually the men
learned the proper rate of exchange and were
in a position to recognize any attempt at
cheating. That there was some cheating must

be taken for granted; yet I mingled for months
with the men of these regiments and I cannot
recall a single instance of that kind. The
soldiers trusted the natives more implicitly
than they trusted each other.

There is much more that might be said of
the work of the United States in Porto Rico,
but it would be only a prolongation of the same
note of progress. Just among ourselves, we
may say with some degree of satisfaction that
we have administered the island honestly, in
the interest of its people rather than of our-
selves. And if some non-office-holding native
now and then fills the air with his discordant
wail, there is an abundance of undeniable
records that will show what Porto Rico was
when the Spanish went down beyond the hori-
zon and what it is in this year of grace.

[The author of this article made a prrsanal investigation of the conditions of labor in the

stores of New York City. She questioned the girls themselves, the proprietors and managers of
the stores, and for some time lived in the "homes" for working girls in various parts of the

city, where she came into intimate relations with them. Her story of conditions is, therefore, a
careful and authentic record of facts obtained at frsl hand.]

City-Fifth and Sixth Avenues and

Broadway between Thirty-fdth Street
and Eighth Street, and Fourteenth, Eighteenth
and Twenty-third Streets between Fifth and
Sixth Avenues-there are between twenty and
thirty thousand girls and women employed
in the dry-goods and department stores, and
nearly three thousand more who are employed
in the smaller shops and in the dry-goods and
department stores of the outlying districts of
the city. Between two and three thousand
girls and women are employed in each of the
larger department stores, and in the smaller
department stores between three hundred and
eighteen hundred.

Much has been said of the inhuman con-
ditions under which this great body of young
women labor. But fairness demands the state-
ment that most of the employers make a com

scientious effort to preserve the health, happi-
ness, and character of their employees. They
do this not so much from humanitarian motives,
perhaps, as from sound business principles.

"The welfare of the help is the welfare of
the business," is the motto of one of the stores,
which, in a quiet and unostentatious way, is
doing a great deal for the bcneftt of its
employees.

In one large department store, where fifteen
hundred girls and women are employed during
the slack season and more than two thousand
during the rush season, a school is maintained
on one of the upper floors for the younger girls,
who receive free tuition in the English branches
during certain hours of each day. Proficiency
in school work is made a reason for more
rapid promotion, and many of the present heads
of departments received most of their education
in the store-school,
