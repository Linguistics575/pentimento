SAFEGUARDS FOR INVESTORS

-its clients. I have in mind a banking house
that, at one time in recent years, did a very
large business for the so-called Harriman
clique. On the day that the Union Paciac
dividend was increased to 10 per cent., the
head of this house turned back to his people.
In the afternoon, he sent out to every customer
' a letter full of the most solemn warning not to
follow the speculation in the stocks of the
Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific. He
advised, without qualification, to sell all stocks,
of all sorts, and either to hold the proceeds in
cash or to invest in only the best kinds of bonds.

"It is my opinion," he wrote, "that it will
be many months, and it may be some years,
before the public will be justified in trading
in this market with any confidence that they are
not mere tools for the use of the great
speculators."

That letter, followed as it was by many
others of a similar tone, practically destroyed
the commission business of that house. The
biggest individual account was withdrawn
almost immediately, and transferred to a house
that is still advising its clients to buy Union
Pacifsc and Southern Pacific at all times.
The old clients of the house did as they were
advised, and their trade in stocks since August
last has been very small indeed. The banker
who wrote the letter knew that his commission
business would be cut down to a minimum
because his clients are not of the class that
trades heavily on what is called the "short
side," hoping for a decline. He did it with
his eyes open, holding that as an honorable
banker worthy of the name, the interests of
his customers came first and his own interests
second.

This is not an isolated case, by any means.
In some measure, every old-line banking
house in Wall Street is trying to do the same
thing, though it does not always succeed.
Individuals have added their assistance to the
warning movement. Mr. Stuyvesant Fish
and Mr. Jacob Schiff are two men whose
voices have been raised to warn the investment
public not to be too sanguine. The warning
came at the very moment that it was most
necded-at the moment when the directors
of the Union Pacific, of the Baltimore & Ohio,
of the Atchison, of the Pennsylvania, of the
Southern Pacific, and of the New York Central
had hung out new lures in the shape of in-
creased dividends. The slaughter that fur.
lowed is a matter of history; but it would

undoubtedly have been a hundred times worse
had not the old-line Wall Street houses, a few
daring individuals, and two or three unhar-
nessed newspapers and periodicals been shout-
ing their warnings from the house-tops for
two full months.

Before passing to another phase of this
subject of public safety and the returning safe-
guards, a word must be said about another
kind of alleged "banking house." There are
three hundred firms below Park Row, New
York, who call themselves by this honored
name, then drag that name through the slime
of dishonesty, deceit, and fraud. They do
not owe allegiance to any of the great financiers.
They are the merest prostitutes of finance.
These firms are formed hurriedly, in most
cases, to sell to the hungry public little blocks
of mining stock, oil stock, cheap and miserable
industrial stocks, stocks that represent a pro-
moter's hopes for the future of some new in-
vention-anything at all, intact, that the poor
public might be induced to buy. They have
no standing. Neither Dun nor Bradstreet
knows them. If they are members in any
exchange at all it is one of the four or fwe self,
organized, lawless, loose, and unholy exchanges
that exist merely to give a weak semblance of
respectability to just such firms as these by
allowing them to call themselves members
of an "exchanged'

The advertisements of these firms are ac-
cepted by three of the great daily newspapers
of New York, and paraded in the Sunday
editions without shame. They do most of
their advertising, however, outside New York,
where the public might be supposed to be
â€œeasier picking." Their cards appear in nine
out of ten of the Wall Street papers, being
refused only by a little handful of clean men
in that delectable branch of the journalistic
profession. Four of their cards appeared
a few weeks ago in a journal devoted to women,
with the alluring statement in one form or
another that "Special facilities are afforded
to ladies desiring to invest." Two of these
firms offered to the widow and the spinstcr a
glorious opportunity to sink their savings or
their life-insurance funds in l cobalt mine
that has not yet disclosed a single ounce of
silver or of cobalt.

These "bankers" have no right to live. In
order to safeguard oneself against them, it is
now necessary to make a rule never, under any
circumstances whatever, to have one single
