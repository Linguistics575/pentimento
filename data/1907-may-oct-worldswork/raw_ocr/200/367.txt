THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULA lâ€˜ION

wrong relation to life and to work in this year
1907 and in these United States of America.
Such unions are throwing away the help and
sympathy and cooperation of other working
men-of the owners of this shop, for example,
who themselves are working men or noth-
ing.

Of Course, such an etTort is " foregone failure.
Else who could conduct shops with any hope
of success? But for the moment even as pitiful
an ctfort to reverse human progress as this is
causes some trouble. For instance, a part of
the edition of the july number of THE WORLD'S
WORK was delayed for a few days, to the
annoyance of some subscribers. There are
very few pardonable reasons for delay in issuing
a periodical. But, if any delay be pardonable,
the publishers hope that this is.

To those who have been patient or sym-
pathetic under this annoyance, the publishers
wish to express their hearty appreciation. The
union feeders and pressmen hare done them
good service by making this publishing house
an open shop from the top Mor to the basement;
and it will remain an open shop.

Most questions that arise in the conduct of
life or of industry are debatable. But this is
not one of them. The conclusion was reached
before the controversy was begun. The owners
of this publishing house might conceivably
shut it up and earn their livings in some other
way-a contingency, however, that is not
imminent; but, as they regard their duty to
themselves and to society, they could not con-
ceivably' conduct it at the retrogressire and
uneconomic dictation of other persons, espe-
cially when this dictation is based on a plan of
work that makes for inefficiency and weakens
manhood.

THE CONFLICT ABOUT PUBLIC LANDS

HERE is, of course, a body of laws to

govern the care and the use and the dis,
position of government lands in the Western
States. But marty of them have been so sys-
oematically disregarded, evaded, and violated
that in many communities they have become
a dead letter. Public opinion has become ad-
justed to evading them. Important enterprises
are conducted in disregard of them, and
large investments made. Many men ceased
supposing that they would ever be rigidly en-
forced; and the "moral sentiment" of many
communities approved their desueturle. Yet
in the main these are wise laws, necessary

for the proper use or for the preservation ot
forests and water-supplies.

When the present Administration began to
enforce them, many prominent men were in-
dicted and some were convicted. But the
sympathy of a large part of the public in the
West was with the violators and not with the
enforcers of the law. At the recent Public
Land Convention in Denver, the Colorado
delegates were badges denouncing "inter-
ference by Government bureaus iinder auto-
cratic rules and regulations"; Senator Hey-
burn exhibited a map of Idaho showing the
large areas of forest reserves and spoke as if
the Gorcrnment had forcibly and wantonly
taken this land from people who had titles to
it; and the drift of the addresses was against
the enforcement of the law.

The whole subject is in a chaotic state.
Congress stopped some executive orders touch-
ing land-administration while they were in
process of execution. .The Western sentiment
--a strong part of it at least-is opposed to
the proper preservation of these forests. The
Administration is, of course, in favor of their
preservation. The public opinion of the coun
try (except so much of it as is more or less
sclfishly interested or has suftered hardship
because of the recent enforcement of laws long
disregarded) demands that the policy of the
Administration be carried out. The conflict
will continue in Congress, as it is all the while
appearing in the courts, where land-thieves
are brought to trial. 1f the general purpose
of the existing laws and the policy of the Presi-
dent prevail, as they are likely to do, Mr.
Roosevelt will receive the thanks of the next
generation, which will be more earnest even
than the opposition of the present. The
Western trip of Seereta ry Gas lield, Mr. Pinchot,
of the Bureau of Forestry ,and Mr. Ballinger,
Land Commissioner, was a wise use of the
summer. These capable and ouragcouspublic
servants can have no aim but the public goo: -
of this generation and of the next; and they will
be able to present the problem and to execute
the laws and to frame policies with first-hand
information.
