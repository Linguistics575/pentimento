agitating the whole civilized world. Scan-
dinavia has hit upon a rational solution. A
Swedish association, "Art for the Schools,"
not content with decorating schoolrooms with
what Mr. H. G. Wells calls "canned art"--
casts and photographs-has set about covering
the walls of secondary schools with mural
paintings by the best artists in Sweden. They
do not choose improving subjects, but those
easily within the children's ken. The largest
school in Stockholm boasts a great wall
decoration by Carl Larsson-a school excursion
in which the figures of the rector, several of
the teachers, and a number of the actual pupils
of that particular school are done from life.
For a Gothenburg school, the same artist has
painted a procession of flower-laden children
on their way to decorate the schoolhouse for
the midsummer festival. After this fashion
they bring painting into the child's own world.
Prince Eugen (himself at painter of ability)
and Andreas Zorn are both warmly interested
in the movement and have more than once
donated the proceeds of their annual exhibitions
to the cause. Here is a plain hint for us.

Moreover, in Scandinavia a dozen societies
have attacked that stronghold of bad taste-
popular fancywork. What has been done in
Old Deerfield, Mass., and a few other isolated
places in America, is done by wholesale among
the peasants of Norway and Sweden. It is a
two-edged campaign. Toward city folk it
exercises the functions of an Arts-and-Crafts
Guild, inculcating a love of what is good and
native rather than for what is mcretricious or
foreign. Toward the peasants, the work takes
on an economic aspect and the Government
lends a hand. Old hand-industries are revived,
fine old Scandinavian designs are collected and
scattered free among peasant craftsmen;
tapestry weaving, wood and metal work in the
splendid dragon style of the vikings are freely
taught to countryfolk, who are encouraged to
make soft vegetable dyes after ancient recipes.
Salesrooms in town dispose of the artistic
peasant work. It means death to the Gibson
pillow, or whatever takes the place of such
atrocities in Scandinavia.

Some people think that the American public-
school child gets too much for nothing. But,
on the theory that the citizens are the State
and have a common right to the public things,
Sweden dowers the school children more lib-
erally than we, sure that what makes for the
welfare of the youngsters makes for the future

welfare of Sweden. There are more free baths,
free dinners, free school books, free doctors,
free dentists, and free oculists. And they are
not abused.

Swedish school excursions are no mere day-
trips. They extend over a fortnight and the
children are sometimes carried over the line
into Denmark or Norway. City children
learn of rural industries, and country children
learn of city mysteries, at firsthand. When
there is an exposition, these excursions assume
mammoth proportions. Fourteen hundred coun-
try children were personally conducted about
the Stockholm Exhibition of 1897 and more
than 3,ooolittlepeople went free to Helsingborg
in 1903. Sweden believes that it pays.

They believe in the pupils' lending libraries,
placed in almost every school in Sweden by a
benevolent conspiracy between publishers (who
remit half the cost of each volume), school
boards, and a society called Common School
Friends.

Small wonder that Sweden is progressive,
for the germs of progress are carefully planted
in little Swedes before they are out of their
'teens. No chance for them to grow up narrow-
minded, accepting the antiquated notions of
their fathers. As soon as they are old enough
to understand, the school children have the
most advanced theories of so-called Social
Science presented to them in simplified form.
The labor problem, defects in local legislation,
the legal position of Swedish women and the
history of the woman movement, problems of
settlement work, poor-relief, housing, coiipera-
tive house building-thes things are set be
fore every Swede before he has time to fossilize.
Therefore, the crust of conservatism is very
thin in Sweden. Would it come amiss if we
preached civic duty and the crime of political
fatalism before the young people of our high
schools?

REACTION TOWARD COUNTRY LIFE

Perhaps the supreme social achievement of
Scandinavia is the glorification of the pastoral
life. There is actually a strong tide setting
from the slums to the farms. The movement
is at its height in Denmark. It is not due to
any colonization schemes or other artificial
devices. The Government and the cities turned
to help the countryfolk; and the countryfolk
responded by displaying an undreamed-of
ability to help themselves. In America, some-
how, many good things skip the country. Public
