HEyear 1893 saw in England a conflict

I between one of the most venerable

statesmen and one of the most vener-
able institutions in existence anywhere in the
world at that time. Mr. Gladstone passed a
bill for Irish Home Rule through a House of
Commons just elected to support him, and that
bill was rejected by the House of Lords. Two
years later, an enormous majority of British
voters endorsed this action of the Lords in
thwarting their own representatives. The
people had declared the hereditary chamber
to be right and the popular chamber to be
wrong, and after an eclipse of sixty years the
House of Lords had become a decisive power
in the state. In 1906 and 1937 the confrict of
the two houses was renewed. For Englishmen,
the matter is of great practical importance; for
constitutional theorists, it is intensely interesting
and suggestive; on the part of those anywhere
who are living under representative institutions,
it may perhaps arouse some curiosity as to the
nature, composition, faults, and merits of the
oldest legislative chamber in the world.

The British legislature possesses from day
to day an unlimited authority over the
whole of the public and private law of the
Empire. It can do anything. To limit its
legal powers there would be need of an inter-
position of Providence. No written constitu-
tion, no referendum, no ancient custom hampers
its full power to turn its lightest or wildest
fancy into the law of the land in a single day.
Of this legislature, together with the King and
the Cornrncns, the House of Lords forms a
co6ttlinate part, whose consent is necessary
to the passing of any act. Sitting at West-
minster on red benches iv a gilded chamber,
down a not very long corridor from the House
of Commons,it is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor of Great Britain, an official who
is at once a judge and a Minister and who-
after the Archbishop of Cynterbury-ranks

highest among British subjects. Six hundred
and twenty-two persons have the right to sit
and vote as members of the House; 549 of these
are hereditary peers, whose rights pass down
from father to son subject to the same law that
regulates the intestate succession to landed
property. Twenty-eight are pccrs elected by
the peerage of Ireland; sixteen are elected by
the peerage of Scotllnd; neither of these bodies
come to the House of Lords in their full comple
ment like the peerage of England. Twenty-six
are Bishops of the Church of England, and
three are Princes of the Blood Royal. But of
this multitude, there are not many to be seen
by him who goes to the gallery and gazes on
the House of Lords at work. Considerably
more than a hundred peers have never been in
the House in their lives. Large numbers
attend but rarely, A great occasion will bring
together good numbers, and more than 400
came to vote against the Horne Rule Bill in
1893. It would not, however, be fair to put
the attendance on days of ordinary importance
at more than fdty or sixty; and the homely
informality of this little band would much
surprise people used to other assemblies.

THE HOUSE OF LORDS AT WORK

From a seat in the gallery the visitor sees the
thrones of the King and Queen at the far end
of the chamber, well protected from dust and
light by dark-red coverings. On the steps of
the throne will be sitting a youth or two, perhaps
a boy in an Eton coat, whose right to loll about
on that distinguished ground is a privilege
granted to the eldest sons of peers in order to
familiarize them with the work of the chamber
where they may one day sit. Sitting or stand,
ing in the same place will be also a Minister
or an cx-Minister of the Crown, who has
strolled along the corridor from the Cbmmons'
House to hear the debate or watch the fate of
some bill that concerns his department. In
