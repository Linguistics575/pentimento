 

THE MONEY-KINGS

You think, perhaps,-that this is hardly true;
but that the man of many millions may with,
draw as easily as you or me. Let us look to a
time when he tried to do it. In the autumn of
1902 this country had arrived at a pinnacle of
prosperity. Tremendously capitalized trusts
by the dozen were declaring dividends, arraying
themselves in the silks and satins of prosperity.
I saw it; so did you. Six months later, the very
rich took fright. If only one, or two, or three
had done it, it would have mattered very little.
But hundreds of them did it all at once. You
saw a million men thrown out of work; you saw
grim poverty sweep down upon the valley of the
Monongahela; you saw a dozen great steam
yachts offered for hurried sale in the daily
papers of New York; you saw bankruptcy fall
upon half a dozen trusts, and you felt the pinch
of poverty in your own little bank account. And
why ?. It was, in part, at least, because the rich
had sought to turn their backs upon their
responsibilities, had sought to escape the web
that they had woven.

Then, what is this subtle, volatile, sensitive
thing, credit? Most men use it; but I have yet
to meet the man who can define it. Most
economists say that it is based upon ownership
of money or of property. Thus, a man who
owns a mill which will produce for him, in the
next six months, wealth amounting to $10,000
can get credit for that amount, payable in six
months. Well and gotxS. But another man
owns, we shall say, nothing. His name is good,
and he enjoys a steady income. He, too, has
credit, perhaps quite as good and extensive as
that of the man who owns the mill. Credit,
then, is not based merely on tangible property.
It is also based on honor, good name, or some
intangible, yet fairly secure inflow of money.

CREDIT, THE BASIS OF BUSINESS

Now, in the business world, it is to-day quite
impossible to keep pace with the times without
making the earnings of to-morrow pay the
debts of to-day. For instance, the Milliken
Steel Company, of Staten Island, has immense
orders on its books for steel, to be manufactured
and delivered to the merchants within the next
year. But it is necessary to spend a lot of
money before that steel can be made and deliv-
ered. Raw material has to be bought, trans-
portation charges must be paid, labor must be
hired and paid by the week or day, rents and
taxes are falling due. The future earnings
are there, on the books, but how can the orders

be filled unless these intangible future orders
can be made tangible, can, in fact, be made
into money?

Perhaps the manager of the plant may go to
the dealers in iron, from whom he must buy
his raw material, and say to them:

"I want 10,000 tons of iron. It will cost me,
to-day, $140,000. I shall take it from you, if
you will take my note for six months."

The dealers know the firm. They consider
the promise perfectly good. He gets the iron.
They get his note. That is one transaction.
But, later in the year, the dealers themselves
find themselves pressed for money. They look
over the notes they own. The Milliken note
looks like good paper. They decide to sell it.
Perhaps some private buyer takes it from them,
but much more likely they take it to a bank.
The bank does not know Milliken Bros., but
it does know the dealers. So the dealers write
their names across the back of the note, turn it
into the bank, and are credited with so much,
on the bank's books, namely the $140,000, less
the discount to correspond to the interest for
the time the note still has to run. That
"credit" at the bank is just as much good to
the dealers as so much cash. They can draw
checks against it, or get it in cash, if they please,
and put the money wherever they like.

Meantime, Milliken Bros. have wages to pay.
The credit they got from the dealers on their
iron did not help them to pay the weekly wages.
Men who work cannot take notes for their
wages; they must have cash. The frm of
Milliken Bros. has not, of course, exhausted
all its future resources in buying that iron.
The money it will receive for its steel will not
only pay off the debt to the iron dealers, but
also all the expense of making the steel. The
manager goes to the firm's bank, explains the
matter of the orders for steel, and asks about
borrowing some money. The bank scrutinize
the business pretty closely, measures up the
contracts for steel, then makes a loan to Milli-
ken Bros. A note is made out, promising to
pay $25,000 to bearer in six months. The
bank takes it, and credits the firm on its books
with that $2 5,000, less discount for six months
at whatever the rate may be. Usually, it is
6 per cent., or thereabouts; but it runs very
high at times, and at other times it is lower.

Now, here are two separate transactions in
credit; and each is performed through a Ixynk.
