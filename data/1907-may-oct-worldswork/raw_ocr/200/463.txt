sewing. They have also succeeded to some
extent as travelling salesmen and agents. There
is opportunity for them in news-stands, tobacco-
and candy-shops and other small businesses.
No doubt other occupations and industries
will be found for them.

But even a few occupations are sufficient for
them all, if the trade and the man are fitted
one to the other, and both are propeil advanced
in the hurrying market-place of life. lhe
practical failure of many graduates of our
schools for the blind is rooted in the entire
problem of education. But in addition to these
there is a class whose problem is not strictly
educational-those who have lost their sight
in mature years.

DlF'F'rCULTrkS IN GETTING WORK TO DO

The lot of an idle graduate of a school who
has learned how to be blind is hard enough.
He leaves school flushed with hope and courage.
He thinks he can brave the world and conquer
it. Perhaps he hears of Fl position as teacher
and makes the necessary application. His
application is refused because he cannot see.
He learns of another position and applies for
it in person, passes all the tests and exam-
inations successfully, and is praised for his
ability. Still his services are not accepted
because it is not thought possible for him to
teach even music as well as a seeing man. Yet
he has been f1tted to teach music. He has
even studied under masters.

If a young blind man, educated and trained
in the dark, loses courage after repeated failure,
what must be the feelings of one who is sud,
denly stricken blind in mine or factory?
Blighted ambitions, sorrow, bitterness and
despair. "What will become of me? Who
will feed and clothe my little ones? Must I
live useless always, an object of charity?"
These are the questions that rack him. He
may try to be cheerful; but happy he cannot
be, unless he finds occupation. His unused
faculties will rust. The light of intelligence
fades from his countenance. His hands grope
for the tool that accident has snatched away.

What shall we do to alter this condition of
the blind in America? First of all, it is neces-
sary to awaken public interest in matters con-
cerning the sightless. An enlightened public
sentiment is the only power in a democracy
that can bring about and maintain the better-
ment of any class. When the public under-
stands the blind man, his needs and capacities,

there will be an end to the more special causes
which we find partly responsible for present
conditions in this country-lark of enthusiasm,
intelligence and cooperation on the part of
those who have charge of the institutions for
the blind.

The superintendents of these institutions,
dependent on boards of trustees who know
almost nothing about the needs of these institu-
tions and the clNiculties of the hliml, trusted
by it public which is not informed, are often
men of indifferent attainment, wedded to petty
theories, and unprogressive. They are gener-
ally kind, and believe that they have the best
interests of their charges at heart. But the
existing condition of the sightless throughout
the country bears sufficient evidence to their
incompetency.

CONFUSION IN PRINTING FOR THE BLIND

An obvious illustration of their incompeteney
and the absence of cooperation between the
schools is the confusion in the prints for the
blind. One would think that the advantages
of having a common print would not require
argument. Yet every effort to decide which
print is best has failed. The Perkins Ir1stitu-
tion for the Blind, with a large printing fund,
clings to Line Lcttcr-cmbosscrl characters,
shaped like Roman letters, in spite of the fact
that most of the blind prefer a point sysLem.
The Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind
offers its readers American Braille, a print in
which the letters are composed of raised clots.
This is tr tt1odification of the system which
was perfected by Louis Braille threc-quarters
of a century ago and is still the system used
throughout Europe. The New York Institution
invented, controls and advocates New York
Point,another species of Braille. The money
appropriated by the national government to
emboss books for the blind is used for ull the
types. The new periodical, the Jfatilda ff eg/er
Magazine for the Blind, the boon for which
we have waited many years, is printed in
American Braille and New York Point. The
same book, expensive to print once, has to be
duplicated in the various systems for the differ-
ent institutions. Other prints illâ€˜C yet to come.
They are still in the crucible of meditation.
A plague upon all these prints! Let us have
one system, whether it is an ideal one, or not.
For my part, 1 wish nothing had been invented
except European Braille. There was already
a considerable library in this system when the
