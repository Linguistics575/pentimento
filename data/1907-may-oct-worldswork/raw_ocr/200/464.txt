9262 WHAT MIGHT B E
American fever for invention plunged us into
this Babel of prints which is typical of the
many confusions from which the blind suffer
throughout the United States.

We Americans spend more money on the
education of defectives than any other country.
But we do not always find the shortest, easiest
and most economical way of accomplishing
the end we have in view. We desire to bring
the greatest happiness to the largest number.
We give generously as earnest of our desire,
and then we do not see that our bounty is
wisely spent.

THE WORK OF TWO WOMEN

Three or four years ago, in New York, two
cultivated women became interested in the
blind. They observed how much pleasure
some blind persons derived from a musical
entertainment, and they thought how many
hours the sightless must spend without diver-
sion. They set to work to establish a bureau
for the distribution to the blind of tickets for
the theatre, the opera and other entertainments.
This brought them into contact with the blind,
and they soon perceived that their efforts to
entertain them were but to gild a sepulchre.
The blind said to them: "Vou are very kind
to give us pleasure. But it is work we need,
something to do with our hands. It is terrible
to sit idle all day long. Give us that wondrous
thing, interest in life. Work wedded to interest
gives dignity, sweetness and strength even to
our kind of life."

The two noble women determined to see
what could be done. They went for infor-
mation to the New York Institution for the
Blind. They asked why the blind were un-
employed. They received courteous assurances
that everything possible was being done for the
blind, that their hard lot was the inevitable
result of circumstances. The fact that they
were idle was deplored, but there was no help
for it. In a world of machinery, specialized
industry and keen competition the blind man
could not expect to find profitable occupation.
He must, it was urged, ever remain a public
charge to be treated kindly, and the young
women were heartily commended for their
efforts to supply them with entertainment.
Indeed, it was argued, it would be cruel to add
to the burden of infirmity the burden of labor.
It would be quite as cruel to expect them to
eam their living as to compel a disabled horse
to earn his oats. (The same kind of specious

argument was being disseminated in Massa,
chusetts and other states.) But the ladies were
too intelligent and too earnest to be convinced.
Their visit was the beginning of a new move-
ment in New York toward the betterment of
the sightless.

AN ADEQUATE CENSUS OF THE BLIND

Soon afterward an association was formed.
Meetings were held. Men of ability and elo-
quence spoke in behalf of the work and drove
the truth home to the people that the heaviest
burden upon the blind is not blindness, but
idleness. The institution raised its head in
protest and self-justification, and tried to
prejudice the blind against the association.
It opposed an adequate census of the sightless.
The association appealed to the Legislature for
an appropriation to carry on the census. The
Legislature made the appropriation and estalr
lished a commission. The Commission appoint-
ed one of the two ladies Director of the Census,
with the result that a complete registry of the
blind of New York State will soon be available.
This census will not be like the United States
Census figures, which are vague and inconr
plete, but will tell how many blind there are,
where each lives, and in what circumstances,
what occupation he has, what trade he has
learned in school, how old he is, how long he
has been blind, and from what cause he lost
his sight. The New York census and the
Massachusetts census will tell with scientific
definiteness what has been left undone, and
will enable us to deal more intelligently with
the problems of the sightless.

The Massachusetts Commission for the Blind
grew out of a volunteer organization which
carried on investigations and experiments. At
the experiment station a few blind persons
learned to weave rugs, fabrics suitable for
curtains, table-covers and sofa-pillows and
other things useful and beautiful. At this
station industries and processes were tested
with a view to increase the number of lucrative
occupations in which the blind, especially
women, might engage. After it had demon-
strated to the state that they are capable of
higher efficiency than they have generally
reached, the association asked the Legislature
for an appropriation to extend the work. The
appropriation was granted, and a commission
was appointed by the Governor to be respon-
sible for the welfare of all the blind in Massa.
