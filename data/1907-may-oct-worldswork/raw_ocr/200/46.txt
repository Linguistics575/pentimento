to rain I had gone out a little way from the
trail and pooled the bark from a couple of
small trees to cover over my camera and the
can of batteries, to keep them from getting wet.
The flash-pan was Mted with a loose cover
easily thrown off when the powder ignited.
Then I put on my rain-coat and crawled under
a thick-limhed umbrella-like tree and waited
for the storm to pass. Right in the middle of

crouched on a limb, rolled himself into a small
ball with his nose resting between his feet, and
