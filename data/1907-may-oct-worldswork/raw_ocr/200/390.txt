a road has ever had. Cotton, sugar, rice,
cocoanuts, cacao, chili, indigo, tobacco, coffee,
hard woods, cattle, and hogs, all await the
freight car in this sixty-mile strip of the west
coast. And off to the sky-line are the moun-
tains, the fabulous treasure houses of Sonora,
of Sinaloa, of Guerrero, and Michoacan, where
copper and gold and silver abound and where'
the peaks are of iron.

"For years," says Moderm Mexico, "the only railroad in
Sonora was the line running from Nogales to Guaymas
known as 'The Burro' . . . The fireman and
engineer often iound themselves short of wood, and it was

their custom to get out and cut a lot at the head of agrade,
and then, after steaming up, to rush pell-mell down the
grade, in the wild hope that Providence and momentum
would lift them up the hill again. It is said that burros
were employed occasionally to haul the engine to the top of
the grade while the conductor played monte with the
passengers and the engineer took a nap. Now this
jerkwater railroad is becoming part oi an enormous iine
stretching from British Columbia to the City of Mexico."

This is the work of Harriman, who is

dollars in Mexico. His Southern Pacific
extension-soo miles now in operation-will

eventually connect Guaymas on the Gulf of
California with the capital. His interests
have so far appropriated $50,000,000 for the
work already outlined, and more than 5,000
men are on his pay-roll in the construction
camps. One million tics are coming from
Japan, and the rails will come from Europe,
since American concerns cannot promise satis-
factory deliveries.

Everywhere engineers are laying out more
roads. There is the loudly trumpeted Mexican
& Orient, also heading for the west coast,
besides two or three shorter lines. Both the

 

    

National and the Central are extending their
network of feeders. The Central is building
from Tampico to the capital, on which it spent
nearly half a million dollars for locating alone.
One bridge, that over the PÃ©nuco, will cost a
million. There is also a million-dollar ship
canal being dug by the Government from
Tampico to Tuxpan. Last of all should be men-
tioned that part of the mythical Pan-Ameri-
can railroad that is not talk, but track-laying.
A few miles further, and Mexico will have done
its part. By September the rails should touch
the boundary line of Guatemala-possibly to
