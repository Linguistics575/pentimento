icans have a lot to learn about the therapeutic
value of exercise. It keeps off fatty degenera-
tion; it keeps off age. Look at the Swedes---
their clean skins, their fresh color, their freedom
from overplus weight. Look at their mortality
rate-the lowest in the civilized world!

Even on the curative side of the health
problem, Sweden can give us points. The
Government believes in fresh-air as medicine
to the children of the slums. Instead of two
weeks in the country, Sweden gives them two
solid months. The ailing, the puny, the weak-
chested among the children of the common
schools go for the summer to vacation colonies
in the mountains. Great benevolent societies
bear the expense, and the government railroads
carry the “ferie barn" free. The colonies
do not cost much because the children them-
selves (under the eye of a matron) do all the
lighter sort of house and garden work, learning
thrift and hygienic methods while they drink
in the mountain air. By actual physical
measurements and tests, Sweden has proved
how much two months of happy, well-ordered
country life will do for under-developed child-
hood. Can we say as much for our fortnight of
free sunshine?

The rational management of doctors might
also be learned from Sweden. The very system
which is raising such a hubbub in America
there flourishes, but flourishes under control.
I mean the taxing of the sick rich to pay the
medical bills of the sick poor. As a matter of
fact, there is no such thing as a doctor's bill in
all Sweden. Once a year every man sends
his contribution to his physician according
to his ability. If his purse is long, he may
send as much as $125. If he is straitened,
he makes it $25. The poor pay a pittance,
paupers nothing at all. If a ductor's patients
are mostly of the unmoneyed class, the Govern,
ment subsidizes him to make up. And for
country districts, where the scattered popula-
tion could not support a good physician, the
State either adds to the practitioner’s stipend
or salaries him outright. Everybody must
have a doctor; that is axiomatic. And he
must be good. There are no fledglings among
the medical men of Sweden, for it takes a man
eleven years to win his diploma. The essential
beauty of the system is that patients do not
neglect small ailments from motives of frugality,
since public opinion forces them to pay their
doctor his yearly stipend whether he has treated
them or not. It's health insurance. You lay

DANISH PROVISION FOR POVERTY AND AGE

Turning to Denmark, we shall pick up some
suggestive hints about the care of the poor.
Destitute Danes do not starve in their pride
rather than come upon charity; and Danish
vagrants do not commit petty crimes in order
to board for a little while at the public expense.
For Denmark is all things to all men. It
draws a sharp line between the man who cannot
support himself and the man who will not.
The second it brands with the accursed name
of pauper, and proceeds to put him through a
regenerating course of sprouts. The first it
shields from the very shadow of disgrace.
Every Danish town has a free fund to tide
working-folk over temporary trouble. No
shame attaches to the acceptance of this sort
of public aid. It is a life-preserver which a
man would be a fool not to catch. To honest
working people in distress, the Danish poor-
law officer is a sort of special Providence. He
not only provides funds to put the embarrassed
on their feet; he helps them find work and
cheap lodgings. If landlords are extortionate,
he can compel them to come to terms. All
things are made to work together for good to
the man who is trying to pull himself up.

On the other hand, once the poor-law officer
has convinced himself that a man is a ne'er-do-
weel, society turns toward that man quite
another face. It will support him, and his
wife and children, too-but on its own terms.
The day he accepts the name "pauper," by
taking am he ought to do without, that day a
man signs away his personal independence.
Society sets out to sicken him of his choice.
At one stroke, she takes from him his right to
vote, his right to marry without the poor-
officer's permission, and his right to pawn his
own goods. He can no longer choose his own
occupation or his own dwelling. Stricter laws
apply to him than to honest men. If he is
disorderly, beats his wife, neglects his children,
or teaches them to steal or beg, to prison he
must go. So long as he remains an "out,
pauper" he is bound to work, and of course
the longer he works the more surely approaches
the day when he can no longer pretend to
need public aid.

And what if he won’t work? Then he finds
himself speedily imprisoned in a workhouse
upon indeterminate sentence. Insubordina-
