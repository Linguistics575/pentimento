THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA

without pay. It was but natural that this state
of affairs, continuing throughout many genera-
tions, should bring the native to a point where
he demanded his pay in advance.

Prepayment for labor was, of course, out of
accord with modern methods, but ingenuity
solved the problem. A box of brass checks,
like those commonlyused in factories, was found
and every native went to work with a check
hung about his neck. The natives were told
that this new money must be kept until pay-
day, when it would be changed into dollars.
After a few weeks had gone by the Filipinos
realized that the checks had no real value,
but that the American firm was treating them
fairly; then they became reconciled to the
ordinary system and it has continued in force.

As soon as it was understood that the Amer-
icans were honest, contractors in and about
the larger cities had no trouble in securing
labor in sufficient quantity. But another
difficulty arose-one more or less common to
all tropical and Latin countries. There are
only about four months in the year when work
of any consequence can be acaomplished-
January, February, March, and May. During
the rainy season construction work in the
country is out of the question, for even the roads
are impassable. Throughout other parts of
the year frequent saints' days and festas
depopulate the camps. It is probable, how..
ever, that these festas will be blotted from the
calendar one by one until only the more impor-
tant feast days remain.

But the native likes to gamble, and the cock-
fighr and pony-race wring from him the last
cent of a week's pay. If he is lucky in his
gaming, he will probably buy a pen of birds,
and then he is supremely happy. When he
travels, he may leave his family at home but a
bird is tucked under his arm; this queer pair
is a common sight on the railroads of northern
Luzon and on the electric lines of Manila.
The Filipino is especially fond of music and
gaiety, but he is devoted to his home and
family. Although not naturally fond of work,
he is willing to work for good food and pleasant
surroundings. Money is not an object to him,
but a little is necessary to enable him to pay
taxes and gamble. In some parts of the
Islands coins are used only as ornaments, and
labor can often be paid for with trinkets. A
shirt of army pattern constitutes a full suit of
clothing for a native and often becomes his
most prized possession. A blanket satisfies

the longing of a lifetime, and an old derby or
silk hat marks the owner as a man of affairs.

In the time that has elapsed since the Amer-
ican occupation, the Filipino has justified the
confidence of those who argued that he needed
only tactful and helpful supervision to develop
him into a valuable workman and a useful
citizen. About five years ago American inter..
ests joined in securing a franchise for an electric
railway and lighting system in. Manila. Three
years were required to build the machinery
and equipment in American shops, to ship it to
Manila, to lay forty miles of track, erect miles
of "feeder Wires,‚Äù and put into operation the
finest electric property west of the Golden Gate.
The tall chimney of the power house is the first
object sighted from an incoming steamer, and
it was erected entirely by natives. Moros and
Tagalogs joined in excavating for the power
house; Igorrotes dropped the ties into place,
spiked down the shining rails, and lifted the
steel poles into position; Iloeanos soon learned
the art of heating iron rivets and deftly tossing
them to a fellow workman high up in the steel
structure of the power house.

TEACHING THE USE OF TOOLS

At first it was difcult to instruct the men in
the use of such simple tools as the pick, shovel,
and wheelbarrow. This had to be done
through an interpreter, but the men were quick
to learn. But the wheelbarrow was a mystery.
Any one with a grain of intelligence could see
that the barrow was to be filled with earth,
stone, or whatever was to be moved. Ordi-
narily it would be filled with the hands, but they
saw that this new tool of the Americana, the
shovel, would do it quicker. But when full,
the barrow was balanced on the head, as are
all bundles in the Philippines, and carried to its
destination! Then "the big boss" showed the
interpreter how to roll it. It was difficult for
them, at first, to balance the load on a single
wheel, but with a little practice it became easy.
That, in a nutshell, is the story of the appren-
ticcship of the Filipino. If the foreman swore at
Miguel for "loaiing" instead of shoveling sand
into the barrow, ten to one Miguel would drop
the shovel and begin to scoop up the sand with
his hands. This reversion to primitive methods
when confused or frightened is only natural
to one who has a lifetime and an ancestry of
primitive customs behind him and only a year
of training in the use of modern tools.
