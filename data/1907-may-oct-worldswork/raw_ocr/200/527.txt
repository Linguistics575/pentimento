party, under Mr. I. W. McConnell, who is
new project engineer, then made a detour of
150 miles to get to a point immediately across
the river. There they crawled down another
fissure. In one of these gulches they scared up
a band of mountain sheep. In this way the
river survey was made, some of thc dcscents
being accomplished by the use of ropes over
cliffs hundreds of feet in height. The work
had to be extremely accurate, for a very small
mistake in so long a tunnel would result in a
failure of the two ends to meet.

The building of the tunnel was at first under,
taken by a private construction company, but

it gave up the contract. It was a much
larger job than anyone hurl supposed. The

Government engineers took over the work,
and they have made records which are believed
to bc unsurpassed. In the west tunnel 809
feet were excavated in one month; an average

of 750 feet a month was made for three months;
and 8,300 feet were removed in a year.

The work has presented great difficulties.
(The famous Hoosac tunnel is the only longer
one in the United States.) In the west end the
workers tapped a subterranean stream and a
cavern charged with carbonicmcid gas which
drove everyone hcltcrskelter out of the hcarl-
ing. The ventilating machinery was turned
off until the tiour subsided, when operations were
resumed. But the engineers soon found that
the tunnel was too hot and that it could not be
properly ventilated, so a new shaft more than
four hundred feet deep had to be sunk to ven-
tilatc the heading. This took three months of
hard work without a foot of progress in the

veins and subterranean streams, cut through
treacherous water-bearing gravel, through a
