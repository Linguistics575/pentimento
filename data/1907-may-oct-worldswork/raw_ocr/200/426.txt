TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS
II. THE BEGINNING OF PUBLIC SERVICE

BY

EUGENE P. LYLE, JR.

F ONE phrase can describe a man's
career, then the career of William H.
Taft would likely be described by

the two words: "Useful Citizenship." Almost
since the day he left college in 1878, during the
thirty years that represent the most active
period of a man's life, he has given practically
his whole time, thought, and effort to the public
service. He has made no money beyond a
moderate living. When he returned from the
Philippines to enter on the expensive duties of
Secretary of War, he had $1,500. The thought
suggests itself that the nation owes this man
something.

It is characteristic of a man like Secretary

neighborhood better." -

but he did have family influence; so there was
required of him the moral courage, "much
greater than that of the poor man," to scorn
idleness and win for himself a useful place in
the community. He began his preparations
in the Cincinnati Law School, and on gradur

Later he was the youngest Yale alumnus to
get the honorary degree of LL. D. Like his
father, he also became a member of the Yale
Corporation. He worked for his father's law
firm, Taft & Lloyd, and did court reporting
for The Times-Star, the paper owned by his
half-brother, Charles P. Taft. Murat Hal-
