I confess that here my courage quailed a bit
and I thought that a few distant shots were all
I should succeed in getting. But by throwing
meat to them, they were kept at it safe distance
and the long poles were a great protection if
they tried to come too near. Two days I
visited the place and, after many hours of
manoeuvring, I managed to get such pictures

and not a moment too soon; before the men
