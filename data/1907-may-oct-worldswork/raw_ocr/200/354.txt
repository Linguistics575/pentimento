annum has an income equal to an income
from $30,000 of 5 per cent. bonds or stock, and
so on through the list of railroad employees.

The railroad employees are an intelligent
class of citizens; and, as the railroad ques-
tion, now being so vigorously discussed by the
legislatures and the people, is a campaign
of cducation-whkh is the only true method of
solving such a problem with fairness to all
interests-l believe the voice of the employees,
individually and through their organizations,
will be steadily heard against unjust laws,
or laws that will unjustly injure their pro-
fession and retard the proper development of
the country, which means constant and in-
creased employment to a greater number of
men, and which furnishes safer tracks and in,
strumentalities in handling the passengers and
the commerce of the country.

In point of fact, the thing that the shippers
and the people of this country now desire is
not so much reduction of rates as it is better
service. The people have a right to insist
that their service shall be constantly improved.

TRANSPLANTING A CITY'S POOR

I do not believe that the railroad managers
of the country will refuse to treat with the
people, through their representatives in Con-
gross, opsnly and fairly on the question of how
the best result may be brought about, nor
hesitate to endorse a legislative policy that
promises better conditions.

Railroad managers will not stand in the way
of just legislation merely because such legisla-
tion might have an adverse effect on railroad
securities in the market. We all recognize
that the true function of Wall Street is of
supreme importance to every section of the
United States. Without its agency we can
neither build, extend, nor improve our great
railroad properties to any large extent.

The leading financial inte"ests, in New York
and other money-centres, are coming to realize
that the only true basis of public confidence
in us and our securities must be found in closer
and more cordial relationship between the
people and the railroads and that the strong
arm of the Government is necessary to accom-
plish the most satisfactory results.

TRANSPLANTING A CITY'S POOR

THE SALVATION ARMY'S PRACTICAL METHOD OF RELIEVING THE
CONGESTION OF ENGLISH CITIES AND PEOPLING A NEW LAND

BY
ELIZABETH A. HUNTER

Sir F rederick Young, had been watching
his gardener transplanting the rank
growth of seedlings from the greenhouse to the
field. Suddenly he saw in that greenhouse a
picture of the modern city, with its congested
population, and in the wide ficlds all those
thousands of acres which still may be found
lying idle, even in England. From that year
dates the cry, "Back to the land." Men began
to see that the solution of one of the world's
great problems lay in "transplanting human-
ity." But how could this be done? The
Salvation Army is answering the question.
Some twenty years later, General Booth
began to give the question consideration. In
1890, he made an experiment with a "back-to-
the-land" colony at Hadleigh, near London.
In 1898, colonies were established at Fort

IN 1869 an English political economist,

Romie, Cal., and at Fort Amity, Col. The
sum of the instruction furnished by these three
transplantings amounted to this: Save for
rare exceptions, the habitual pauper cannot be
made to support himself, even on a treadmill.
But the man who is honestly willing, despite all
inexperience, can support himself several
times over when given his chance on the land.
The question was how best could he be given
the chance.

The "Army's" Transportation Department
watched its experiments for five years longer
and then decided that it had found out. It
could not, perhaps, transfer the man-willing-
tom'ork directly to the land, but it could
transfer him to a country where there was land
by the million acres to be had. In 1903, it
began to move selected emigrants from England
to Canada. By the end of 1905, it had brought
