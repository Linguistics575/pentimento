A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES

as capable as any other class. Witness the
results of Miss Berry's school at Rome, Ga.
Witness the cities of Atlanta and Chattanooga,
where many of them have already made for-
tunes and become important forces in industry.

The Southern people who have dwelt here
from the beginning on the slopes of this upland
South-from the blue-grass farmers of Virginia
and Tennessee and Kentucky, to the upland
cotton planters of Georgia and South Carolina
-hare been among the sturdiest of the Amir-
ican people. As most of the manufacturing
industries in the South are naturally in this
region, so also naturally most of the great men
in Southern history have come from this region
-from jefferson, Madison, and Monroe to
the present generation of industrial captains
in the South. This upland South will become
the home of a population ten-fold as great as
it now contains-perhaps within the life of
living men; for there are are all kinds of chances
for making homes and building fortunes there
-in town and from the soil.

This is the part of the South, too, that le;
not only a less troublesome rave problem than
any other part, but a more democratic struc-
ture of society. There is less class distinction

and there is, of course, the widest variety of
industry. White men work hcru-lrave always
worked at all trades and callings.

MOUNTAIN CITIES

Glance at this growth of these cities. The
population of Knoxville in 1000 was only32,637
but the building permits of last year require the
expenditure of a million and a quarter dollars;
bank deposits grew from 4:} millions in 1900
to 9} millions last year; manufacturing invest
ments from 5 millions to nearly 9 millions;
the number of employees is half as great again,
and wages have nearly doubled in six years.
The number of telephone instruments increased
from 2,300 to 4,500. It offers manufacturing
opportunities in iron and steel, wood, marble,
clay, and textiles. "All these are at our doors,"
and most of them are now carried on with
good profits and call for extension-all 1,000
feet above the sea, where there is abun-
dant water-power and the river runs between
walls of marble. The schools, including the
University of Tennessee, have half as many
more students now as they had in 1000.

On the eastern side of the mountains, some-
what similarly situated, is Lynchburg, origin-
ally chiefly a tobacco market but now the home
