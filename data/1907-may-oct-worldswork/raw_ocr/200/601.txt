INVESTING MONEY BY SMALL
INSTALMENTS

"Some months I have $50 of savings, and other
months it is as low as $10. There is only one savings
bank in town, and I have as big an account in it as it
will take. It pays me sy per cent. I cannot buy bonds
because they are too large. I am afraid to buy stocks,
because I do not know anything about them. The amount
of money is too small to loan as it comes in. What
would you advise as a safe means of investing these
small savings as they accumulate?"

The above extract from a letter puts pretty
clearly the case of hundreds of savers and
would-be investors throughout the country.
Most bonds and notes are issued in blocks of
$1,000 and upward, which puts them out of
the reach of any man who desires merely to
invest current savings. Yet bonds and notes
are unquestionably the safest medium for sav-
ings of this kind. What has Wall Street pro-
vided to meet this demand?

Let us take the case of the man who will
have an average of $3100 every six months for
investment or for a savings bank. At the out-
set, good advice would be to leave it in the
savings bank until the limit is reached. In this
state, the limit is $3,oco, not for each family, but
for each individual. An account can be opened
for father, mother, and each of the children, if
one care to do it. In the case of banks that pay
4 per cent., in New York, this is good sense.
Not everyone is fitted to become an investor.

Failing this, and presupposing that the saver
wants to be an investor, there are half a dozen
ways in which he can do it with safety and with
profit. First of all comes the municipal bond.
New York City, for example, issues its own
bonds, or stocks, in lots as low as $10. The
saver can get them, to yield 4 per cent. or more.
They have some advantage in being tax-free
in this state. Similarly, in every state there
will be found plenty of strong municipal bonds,
tax-free, that can be bought in very small
blocks. Even Ohio, which taxes nearly every-
thing, is now exempting its municipals. I
believe that it will be found profitable in nearly
every case to get any bonds of this sort regis-
tered in your own name, rather than have to
collect the coupons every six months. Of
Course, that is a matter of preference.

The United States Government issues its
bonds in small blocks, usually from $50 up,
but the Panama Canal loan is from $20 up.
These bonds are so high in price, owing to
special causes, that they may not be regarded
as fit investments for savings. The new
Japanese 4 per cent. loan in this country is in
blocks of $50, $100, etc. One Mexican bond
listed on the Stock Exchange may be bought in
lots of $100 and multiples of that sum. These
last two issues are not suitable for every saver
of money, but they are fairly good all-around
investments for the average man to own.

Turning to corporation bonds, which should
naturally constitute the largest part of the
investment of the people, one finds only a few
of the big, popular, widely scattered bond
issues made in blocks of $100 or less. Some
of the very old bonds, such as the Alabama &
Vicksburg or the Atlanta & West Point issues,
created to attract the subscriptions of the
neighbors, were made in such small blocks.
In fact, the Southern railroads have always been
inclined to make their bonds smaller than the
Northern bonds, because popular subscription
has very often been essential to the building of
the smaller roads of the South.

The smallest listed railroad bond of which
I know anything was issued in 1877, and will
be paid off next July. It is called the Buffalo
& Southwestern first-mortgage bond. It bears
6per cent., and was issued in blocks of $50.
The road is a part of the Erie. There are two
or three other small bond issues on the old
branches of the Erie that have bonds in blocks
of $100, but all the well-known newer bonds of
that system are in blocks of from $500 upward.
If one go through the list of bonds, it will be
discovered that nearly all the issues in blocks
of $roo are dated in the twenty years from
1865 to 1885. It was a period in which the
builders of roads sought to enlist the sym-
pathies and get the help of the people through
whose land they built.

Nowadays, an occasional railroad makes its
bonds in such small blocks, but usually it is
only when the bonds are to be listed in Ger-
many, or France, or Holland. The new 41} per
