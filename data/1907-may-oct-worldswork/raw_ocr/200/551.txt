TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG

importance in my mind with that of thinking
out my to-morrow's schedule. I will stay and
potter about little things that do not need
attention. My sense of balance, of proportion
and perspective, is gone. I've lost my eye for
the cash value of things

A man whose mind is in good condition can
stand off from his work, look at it in the bulk,
and say to this item, "You need doing right
away;" to another, "You're unimportant, you
can wait;" and to another, "Somebody else
can look out for you." No fatigued person can
see things straight.

And the moral of that is: Don't make any
important decisions except when your mind
is fresh.

With the best intentions in the world, many
men commit an economic sin right here.
They come to the office in the morning with
a good bunch of enthusiasm and clear-headed-
ness to their credit. They feel it; and so they
say: "Come, let us be virtuous. Let us get

rid of these million and one small left-overs.
That will clear the way for the big matters on the
docket." There's nothing that uses up nervous
energy faster than a long series of fussy responsi-
bilities. When it comes time later for the big
thh1gs-the important decision, the diplomatic
letter-the seconscientious spendthrifts have
neither heart nor head left for them.

The big things should be done first.

Every man at his best is. a man of mark, if
he only knew it. When he is up to his top
range he is a man with a special power and with
a special opportunity. It is a pity that he
should throw away that special power on the
accomplishment of small, everyday respon-
sibilities that do not need special power-
drudgery that could be put through with equal
success when the first fine cutting edge of his
mind was dulled-for when he has done this
he has thrown away his special opportunity
as well. The big thing is the opportunity for
the big man.

TAFT: A CAREER OF BIG TASKS
Ill
HIS WORK AS A FEDERAL JUDGE

EUGENE P. LYLE, JR.

l N I HEN Secretary Taft, then Solicitor
General, was named for the Circuit
Bench, a party of his former class-
mates gave him a dinner at the Union Club in
New York. At any momentous turning in the
road, Taft never fails to come in for a heart-
giving God-speed from his old Yale friends,
and the Union Club dinner was an instance.
But the affair is mentioned rather because of a
very significant expectation that then took firm
hold in the minds of the hosts. They wore
imbued with the idea that Tait's star was now
definitely on the rise, and that henceforth
he would go ahead rapidly, and higher and
higher, to the very top. Their intuitions were
Correct. His work as a Federal judge was not
that which stirs the popular acclaim, but it
was history-making. And Taft was indeed
rising fast, even though for the next nine years
he was pleasantly enchained to the Bench.
But other friends, less discerning, perceived

only a throwing away of golden opportunities.
They cited the Solicitor General's renown in
winning all the big Government cases, which
renown might now be coined into riches in
'private practice. Law firms guaranteed him
splendid sums if he would join them as partner.
But Mr. Taft said very quietly, "There are
bigger things in the world than money." His
bent was judicial. He would rather be judge
than advocate, though one meant only $6,000
a year, and the other at least $30,000. He
left the battleground to others. Besides, he
was now in the line of succession for the one
absorbing ambition of his life, the Supreme
Bench. Accordingly, in March, 1892, at the
age of 35,116 accepted President Harrison's
appotntrt1cnt.
