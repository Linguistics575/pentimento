man will say, "It is a place to put your money
so that it will be safe." He means a savings
bank. Another, a learned one, replies, "It is
an institution established to certify credits."
He means a commercial bank. Yet another
declares that it is "an investment institution,
into which you put your money for safe-keeping
and profit." He probably means a trust com-
pany, or perhaps a private bank. As a matter
of sober fact, the term "bank" is now so
broad that it cannot be defined in a few
words. For example, a savings bank in New
York state is as different from a savings
bank in Maine as a steamship is from a
full-rigged ship.

The object of these articles is to bring out
some of the most striking facts about banks,
bankers, and banking. It is full time that the
people came to understand some of these mys-
teries. Whatever a bank may be, it will be at
once evident, from the introduction to this
article, that it not only holds the people's money,
but also that it is the most important of all
the agencies that make for prosperity or the re-
verse in the country. The time is coming, and
swiftly, when the bank will take the place of
the railroad as the centre of the popular interest
and the popular agitation. From a fair work-
ing knowledge of the ways of both the railroad
and the bank, I believe that the latter is not
only the more immediately important to the
people, but also the more worthy of public
attention on account of methods and manners.

THE BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES

Briefly, it is well to outline the banking
situation in this country. I prefer to do it in a
table, taken from the report made by the
Government last October. The table shows
the number of banks of various sorts, and the
amount of deposits in each. It is important
only because it is the basis of the whole series
of articles that is to follow.

NUMBER DEPOSITS

 

National 6,05 3 $4,056,000,000
State 8,862 2,742,000,000
Loan and Trust Co's 742 2,009,000,000
Savings Banks 1,319 3,299,000,000
Private Banks 929 110,000,000
Non-reporting 3,49! 413,000,000

Total 21,396 $12,629,000,000

Anyone who cares to revise the figures is at
liberty to do so. Later figures are available
for the national and savings banks, but not
for the whole list. At the worst, changes are

comparatively slight. This table is recent
enough.

Now, here arises a mystery. It was shown
earlier in this article that all the banks have
in their vaults only (h,rcxo,coo,roco of cash.
Then, you may ask, how is it that the Govern-
ment shows that there are $r3,ooo,oao,oao of
deposits in these banks? And if the con-
spirators of whom you write can get nearly the
whole of that billion dollars of real money,
what do the rest of us get?

You get credit, that is all. It is nothing to
be alarmed about, for the credit is good. Let
us say that the table shows $rr,ooo,ooo,ooo
of deposits against which the banks have no
cash to report. If not cash, what then? The
answer is simple. A very large part of the
balance is represented by first-class bonds--
government, railroad, municipal-or real estate.
An even larger part is balanced against the
trade of to-morrow. It includes notes issued
against the cotton crop, the wheat crop, the com
crop; or notes of the great manufacturers, issued
against orders that are to be filled within six
months; in fact, that balance which supports
your bank account means the commerce, the
industry, the business of this country. Is it
not good enough? In England, they figure that
if the combined banks show one dollar of cash
for every nineteen dollars of such credits the
banks are sound. With us, the proportion is
about one to ten. If the United States is not
good enough security, take your money from
the bank and hide it in a stocking.

The bank is just as sound as are the people
that run it. If your bank president is a burglar,
a thief, or a pirate by birth and election, then
it is not a safe bank, no matter under what law
it is organized. If the cashier is a gambler or a
race-track follower, your money, or some of it,
is in danger. In some few cases-or perhaps it
would be truer to say in many cases-you must
look to the law under which your bank is
regulated and inspected; but the point of first
importance is-the man that runs the bank.

THE OVERLORD OF CREDIT

Therefore, this study of the banks and
bankers of the United States begins with a
man. He is a man who has built up in the
midst of a presumed Republic of Banks
a little plutocracy. You will find the heart
and centre of this plutocracy in the middle of
the western edge of a fiat-ttwed desk located
in a small office in the southwest comer of the
