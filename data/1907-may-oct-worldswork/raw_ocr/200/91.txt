WHAT SCANDINAVIA CAN TEACH US

tion there lands him promptly in a penal work-
house, where he gets no dinner till he has earned
it, where he lives in a cell deprived of tobacco,
visits, and the privilege of free correspondence.
Six months is the shortest term he can hope for,
and then release means only return to an ordi-
nary workhouse, where he stays till the
authorities believe he has acquired the habit of
work. They say that when a man has once
been through the rigors of a term in a Danish
penal workhouse, he never wants to go back.
The system works; it regenerates confirmed
paupers. Why should it not work on our side
of the big pond?

Not satisfied with "making it hot" for
paupers, Denmark goes further and offers a
powerful incentive to a life of honest work.
Every working man and woman who has
lived blameless, neither committing crime,
nor being guilty of drunkenness or immorality,
nor accepting pauper aid, graduates at sixty
into the honor of an old-age pension. That is,
of course, in case they have no money for their
support.

Now the spectre of our aged poor is the poor-
house. But the Danish old-age homes do not
mean heart-break, but proud content. The
distinction of the pension draws the sting of
"coming on the State." The homes are de-
lightful places. with private rooms, prettily
furnished; military bands play in the gardens,
and a general air of cosy comfort prevails.
The pensioners are free to go where they
choose and to receive visitors how and when
they please. Under no unnecessary survel
lance, they are as contented as kittens.

These are the deserving old people. But
in Denmark even the undeserving aged get a
soft berth. They are called paupers, which
is in itself a terrible thing. But then they are
beautifully taken care of. In Copenhagen,
the "Almindelig" is like Elmira, divided into
three grades according to the respectability of
the inmates, and the aged paupers have a
chance to rise to greater privileges and comforts
if they choose to mend their ways. For Den-
mark never wholly despairs of reforming a
pauper until he is dead. The poorhouse is for
the aged alone; no insane, demented, nor
inebriate old folks are ever lodged there, and
110 infants nor human wreckage drift in to
complicate the problems of the institution,
which is managed solely for the good of old
people. There are libraries and smoking-
rooms and gardens. The inmates can work

if they like and sell their bits of knitting and
their hand-made shoes, keeping the money for
themselves. Were it not for the name "paw
pcr," they would be quite content.

Aside from its human kindliness, this system
has two striking advantages over our own
method of caring for the aged and indigent.
With us, the fortunate few are housed by private
charity in old-age homes where it is to be feared
they are altogether too much managed by
assiduous and philanthropically minded boards
of ladies. For the rest, there is nothing but
the poorhouse; and the muck-rake all too
seldom betrays the squalid misery of such. Not
only are the Danish old-age homes under
responsible official management, instead of
being subject to the whims and wranglings of
private charitable boards, but they are wide
open to visitors. The sunlight of publicity
destroys the germs of "graft."

HELPING PEOPLE TO SELF-HELP

In America, we are just learning that the
greatest gift you can give a blind man is the
ability to earn his own living. Denmark
extends that boon to the halt and maimed as
well as to the blind. A workman crippled in
a Danish factory knows precisely what to do.
He goes to the School for Disabled Workers
and learns to support himself without the lost
arm or leg or finger, as the case may be. The
school has made an exhaustive study of trade
chances for crippled folk. It provides tools,
food, medicine, and free orthopedic treatment
for its unfortunate pupils, buys their work as
soon as it is salable, and once they know a
trade finds them positions. Here is a prophecy
for the future extension of the American move-
ment for the industrial independence of the
blind.

Although not a public bencfacence nor a
private charity but a cold business proposi-
tion, the Danish Garden Union deserves men-
tion here. It leases garden plots to city people
cooped up in tenements. On the outskirts
of Copenhagen, great tracts of land are fenced
in and divided off into hundreds of tiny indivi-
dual gardens, each with summerhouse and
seats, where the pueblo dwellers may come
to delve in the soil to raise their own salad and
flowers, and to take tea under their own vine
and figtrce. We have tried the municipal
potato patch: Why not rent out the waste
lands in garden plots to the poor?
