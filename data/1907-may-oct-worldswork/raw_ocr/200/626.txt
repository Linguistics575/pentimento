of the worst injuries to the community, how-
ever, have been the result rather of stupidity
and incompetence on the part of the municipal
authorities than of dishonesty. Schools have
not been provided in sufrocient number or in the
right places; roads and bridges have been ill-
planned, ill-paved, and badly maintained;
water systems have been frequently polluted,
and even left polluted for long periods, as at
Pittsburg; the police department has some-
times been so corrupt and ill-disciplined as to
become in parts of great cities the ally of vice,
and the corruptor instead of the protector of
society; pay-rolls have been padded; inspectors
have been unfaithful; unreasonable wages have
been paid for a bad day's work and exaggerated
prices for street lamps and other city supplies;
trades unions have been allowed to introduce
their low standards of industry and good-will,
and with consummate sellishness to keep non-
union laborers out of cities which were in utmost
need of abundant labor; the term " city laborer"
has become a discreditable title instead of a
peculiarly honorable one, as it should be, and
valuable long-term franchises have been given
to monopolistic corporations without adequate
compensation to the city.

CITY GOVERNMENT BY COMMISSIONS

These evils have within recent years become
so deplorable that many efforts have been made
in a partial and detached way to remedy them.
One tolerably successful method has been to
take out of the hands of city governments large
portions of their work, and assign them to state-
appointed commissions. Thus, in Boston, all
the park work is in the hands of two commis-
sions-one city, the other state-appointed; the
police are governed by an appointed commis-
sioner; the water supply and the main intercept-
ing sewers are in the hands of a state-appointed
commission; the city library and the city hos-
pital are managed by appointed boards of
trustees; and the fire department is controlled
by a single commissioner appointed for that
one function, This means, of course, that a
large amount of municipal business has been
withdrawn from the mayor, aldermen, and
council, and placed in the hands of small
bodies organized each for a special part of the
city's work.

Another method lately come into successful
use is to replace the mayor, aldermen, and coun~
cil by a single body whose functions are wholly
administrative. Thus the city of Galveston

GOVERNMENT BY FEWER MEN

procured from the legislature of Texas, after
the tidal-wave catastrophe which almost de-
strayed the place, a wholly new city charter
which gave all city powers to a body of five men,
of whom three were originally appointed and
two elected, but all of whom are now elected
by the people. Each of these five men has a
large department of the city work to superin-
tend, and together they employ the needed
experts and conduct the city's business on
business principles. This venture of the city
of Galveston, entered upon under desperate
circumstances, has been so successful that it has
been copied in several other Texan cities,
always with good results. Moreover, much
older and larger cities than Galveston have
adopted that method for parts of the city
administration. Thus the public schools have,
in several American cities, been placed in the
hands of small boards which themselves do no
executive work, but only direct and organize
the experts they employ. A good example of
this method of accomplishing honestly and
efficiently municipal work has been set by Con-
gress in appointing a small commission to carry
on the whole municipal business of the city of
Washington, including the assessing of taxes
and the spending of all the money so collected.
To be sure, the case of Washington is unique,
because it is neither a manufacturing nor a
commercial city, and the motives which attract
to it a considerable population are peculiar.
The number of members of such a municipal
board would naturally vary with the size of the
city; but it never ought to exceed seven. The
ancient title of mayor might be kept in use by
giving it to the chairman of the board.

These modes of procuring an honest and
eff1cient transaction of municipal business, or
of portions thereof, resemble the ordinary mode
of conducting great industrial, financial, and
transportation companies, and they also recall
the original New England town government.
They have, however, been resorted to perforce,
and not by the desire of the people.

It has often been alleged that effective com-
missions of this sort are undemocratic, that they
escape from the control of the people, and be-
come arbitrary and inconsiderate in their
methods and manners. This objection requires
some examination. In the first place, every
commission, every small school committee, and
every complete city government, like that of
Galveston, acts under a state statute or charter
which defines its duties and powers. It there,
