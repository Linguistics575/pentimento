THE DAWN OF A

of this is concentrated so as to make the average
along the projected railroad lines from 2,000
to 3,000 per mile. A continuous line of villages
nearly twenty miles in length extends along the
survey line on Fanny, and much of the country
is so densely populated that a traveler is never
out of sight of a house.

It is probable that two classes of service will
be provided, the iirst differing but little in
appointments from the standard equipments of
America. The second, which precedent has
designated as third-class, will be less ornate in
finish and will provide fewer accommodations.

Of a million and a quarter passengers carried
over the lines of the Manila and Dagupan
Railroad for a given period, over a million were
third-class, and the equipment shows nine
third-class cars for every first-class coach.
Despite the small percentage of first-class
passengers, this service must be maintained for
Spanish residents and the better class of natives.

It is interesting to note that, on account of
the average small stature of the natives, narrow-
gauge cars will have practically the same
numerical capacity as standard-gauge cars
would have for Americans. Owing to the fact
that nearly all of the native shippers dispatch
goods in small quantities, freight cars having
a capacity of only four or five tons will be used.
The roads will be narrow-gauge but in every
other respect will be equal to the best American
railroads.

THE ROUTE Oh' THE SURVEY

The main line on the island of Panay will
be 110 miles in length, and will serve about
629,000 inhabitants. At lloilo, the southern
terminus, the harbor improvements are almost
completed. and the little white city will soon
become a busy port. From 1loilo to Passi,
the road runs through a succession of villages;
with the exception of some thirty miles, where
the road crosses the backbone of the island,
the entire distance to Capiz is one continuous
settlement.

Passi is a thriving city but suffers from the
fact that communication with 1loilo is limited
to the dry season, The backbone of the
island is a low range of hills, extending from
east to west, the divide being north of Passi
and south of Dao. Nearly all of this land is
suitable for hemp, coffee, rice, and fibre. Na-
tive pineapple fibres are woven into cloth and
nearly every house has a crude loom on which
the women and children weave sugar sacks

from the fibre of the palm. Millions of these
are shipped every year from Iloilo to Negros, to
be distributed to the great sugar plantations.

Dao is a junction point, the railroad branch-
ing to Capiz and Bataan, both seaports on the
northern coast. The land from Dao north is
exceptionally fertile and the population is
dense. The estimated cost for this part of the
system is more than $4,000,000. Owing to
the large number of streams to be crossed,
bridges will average $7,000 a mile. It is
remarkable that 3 per cent. of the entire mileage
will be composed of bridges, trestles, or culverts.

Concrete and steel alone will be used in all
bridge structures, and the line as a whole will
be more substantial than is customary in initial
railroad construction. Railroads are usually
built through sparsely settled territory and
require time in which to develop traific. In the
case of the Philippine railroads, the population
is already there and the inauguration of both
passenger and freight business will be simul-
taneous with the advent of the carrier.

Throughout the island of Panay the land
holdings are small, averaging about two acres,
sugar and rice being the chief products of the
lowlands. The high and rolling country to the
east and west of the trunk-line is adapted to
the production of coffee, cocoa, hemp, and other
vegetable fibres.

Negros, lying just to the south of Panay,
is probably the richest island, potentially con-
sidered, in the Philippine group. Its total
population is but 5 per cent. of the Archi,
pelago, and but 10 per cent. of the land is under
cultivation; yet it produces half of the sugar
grown in the islands. It is also an important
factor in the hemp industry. The island is
entirely volcanic in formation, the resultant
soil being cspccially well adapted to the growing
of sugar cane. Two large volcanoes, one active,
the other extinct, are striking features of the
landscape. From these the land slopes away
gradually to the sea. Practically all the sugar
produced is grown near the coast, but there are
enormous tracts of sugar land extending back
into the interior from which thousands of tons
of sugar can be taken annually when transporta-
tion by rail is possible. The present output
of 80,000 tons of sugar per year will rapidly be
increased to 400,000 or 500,000 tons when the
railroads are completed and the hacienda: can
be worked on a large scale.

The terminals of the Negros line are Hinm-
maylan on the west coast and Escalante on the
