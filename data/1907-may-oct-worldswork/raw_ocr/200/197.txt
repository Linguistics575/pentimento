sentiment is growing up that in time will force
all these children into the schools, and it is
largely on accountof the mill prosperity that the
school facilities are being made adequate to
attend to them. The mill presidcnts' con-.

Carolina has passed such a law and another

hours of labor. The age limit of these laws
is still low, but as public sentiment and the
school facilities grow the limit will be raised.

another mill 0 per cent. interest is allowed on all
money left with the company treasurer more
than six months. In some places the opera"
tives are beginning to save money. Many of
the people who work in the mill at Ramseur,
N. C., own their own homes, with gardens
about them. Some even own farms that they
rent and many have bank accounts. If people
come to work there who do not measure up
to the moral standards of the community, a.
delegation from the mill will notify the owner
and he dismisses them. They live as well as
any people of small means in a small town.
Ramseur has been a mill town for two or three

It has no "problems." And the mill there
has better labor and more of it in proportion
than most of the mills in the South. k The
