_C)PsoNINs--A NEW HOPE FOR HEALTH

A METHOD OF INOCULATION TO INCREASE THE RESISTING POWER OF THE BLOOD

BY

DR. EDWARD A. AYERS

F THE defences of the human body,
0 the skin is the outer wall, impenetrable
to all bacterial foes save a few. But
there are hordes ever ready at an iastant's
opportunity to rush in through a break in the
wall or to enter through an open gate. There
are natural gates to the fortress, such as the
eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth. Each
has its own peculiar guards-tears, wax, mu-
cus, and automatic gates; and many of these
entrance tunnels are lined with out-sweeping
brooms-fine hairs, similar to the "nap" or
"pile" of carpet or plush-which constantly
sweep back and forth like wheat stalks waving
in the breeze. You cannot see them with the
low-powered eye, but neither can you see the
germs. They sweep the mucus from lungs and
throat and try to keep the ventilators free from
dust and germs. Behind the scarf wall of the
skin and the broom-brigade of the mucous
membranes, the soldier corpuscles of the blood
march around the entire fortress every twenty-
eight seconds. But a cut, a bruise, a cold
draught, wet feet, a stuffy, germ-laden room
upset the routine and there is a rush of thou-
sands of white blood-cells to the break.

Within the bodyâ€™s protecting wall (the skin),
the blood maintains a standing army of white
blood-cells, some 30 billions strong. Disease
germs of various kinds, in varying numbers, are
constantly scaling the wall or entering the body
through its natural gates or through abrasions.
It is the business of the white blood-cells to
attack these invaders and destroy them before
they can multiply to the point of producing
illness. The defense of health is carried on
by the blood in four ways.

The blood covers some germs with a sticky
paste and makes them adhere to one another,
thereby anchoring them so that they become
as helpless as flies on fiy-paper. The paste
comes from the liquid of the blood, the plasma.
Another bloai-weapon (the "lysins") dissolves
the germs as lye does. A third means of de-

tense is the ability of the white blood-cor-
puscles to envelope and digest the living germs.
One white cell can digest dozens of germs but
it may mean death to the devouring cells.

The fourth and recently discovered weapon
of the blood is called the opsonins. This is a
chemical material present in all blood, but in
varying degree. Metschnikoff demonstrated
the ability of the white blood-cells to ingest
bacteria. Sir Edward Wright has shown that
these cells eat a larger number of bacteria when
the latter are soaked in opsonins; and also
that this appetizer can be made in a laboratory
out of a colony of hot-house bacteria and used
as a "vaccine," each variety of germ requiring
opsonic sauce made from juices extracted from
the bodies of its own species.

We must now stand back a pace, while
studying this battle picture of cannibal germs
and devouring blood-cells, and get the perspec-
tive of the whole scene. In the complex
mysteries of immunity lie our weapons for the
conquest of most of the diseases that kill thirty-
four out of thirty-five human beings before
they have lived long enough to die of old age.
Since the day when Jenner proved that vac-
cination so affects the blood that the small-
pox germ can no longer live upon it, it has
been the accepted tenet of physicians that,
since there is smallpox immunity, there must
be immunity from diphtheria, typhoid,, scarlet
fever, measles, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and
other diseases. Light began to penetrate this
mystery when Pasteur evolved the problem of
germ fermentation.

Immunity is a most complicated subject.
Why is it that A, having had smallpox, is safe
from it for a number of years? Why does B,
equally exposed with C to scarlet fever, retain
his health while C is stricken? Why is it that
D lies down and dies from pneumonia while E,
apparently in equally good or bad condition,
recovers? Why does cancer attack man but
pass animals by? Why does the malarial
