THE MONGOLIAN
I may be allowed to speak with some positive-
ness. For two years I was State Health
Officer of Oregon, and one of my first duties
was a thorough investigation of the Chinatowns
of San Francisco and Portland with reference
to the bubonic plague, which was at that time
smouldering in the former city. If there was
anything in these colonies that I did not see, it
was my own fault, as I was always courteously
accompanied by Federal, state or muni.
cipal officers. When in search of a suspected
case of plague, every door which was not
promptly opened on demand was smashed in
with an axe. In addition, I have been for
years keenly interested both in tropical dis,
eases and in the forms assumed by European
diseases in Oriental races.

I have no hesitation in saying that neither
the Chinese nor the Japanese has a single dis-
ease or vice which does not exist among white
men, except certain geographical infections like
beri-beri, nor is he subject to them in any
higher degree than white men of his grade of
intelligence. Leprosy, for instance, is no more
prevalent among them than it was in Norway
and Sweden fifty years ago, and in Scotland and
Ireland 150 years ago. More lepers have
actually come into the United States from
northern Europe than from all Asia, and since
the United States Marine Hospital Service
began inspecting intending immigrants in
Chinese ports, scarcely a single case has entered
by any Pacific port. Whatever danger threat-
ened from this disease is already abolished.

The same may be said of any further danger
from the bubonic plague. While both Chinese
and Japanese suffer severely from tuberculosis,
this is little more prevalent among them than
among Irish, Scandinavians, Italians, Russians,
or Hungarians, and can with equal readiness be
absolutely excluded by competent sanitary
inspection and quarantine regulations. Dis-
eases peculiar to men are neither more frequent
nor more virulent among them than among
white siren of the same class. Most cases have
been contracted since coming to this country.

The sanitary (or, more properly, insanitary)
conditions of Chinatowns are only such as
result from overcrowding. The chief diffi-
culty in the way of their complete removal is the
shameful opposition of the white owners of the
property, manyof them pillars of society and
of the church, whose enormous revenues from
the rookeries are in direct ratio to the number
of tenants they can crowd into them. Money

greed and the dishonesty of politicians and
police who blackmail its vices and necessities
are the sole hindrance to the cleansing of these
" Oriental plague-spots."

The Chinese contribute to the situation
simply by their patient submission to over-
crowding and their willingness to pay rent for
space in which a white man would suffocate
Contrary to popular impression, they are not
dirty in their personal habits. I have physi-
cally examined scores of Chinese and Japanese,
and they strip cleaner than any European im-
migrants of their class. Their bedrooms are
neatly kept and their kitchens are cleaner than
those of the average restaurant. In fact, they
must be clean, as a matter of stern survival
necessity. I have frequently seen inside-rooms
fifteen feet square, without windows or airshafts,
their only opening being a door into a dark,
narrow passage, in which cooked, ate, and
slept ten to twelve Chinese; and yet there was
little or no offensive odor.

Chinese and Japanese servants are models
of neatness and cleanliness and usually report
for duty in white duck jackets. They keep
both kitchens and bedrooms far cleaner than
the average foreign-born hired girl.

Any Chinatown can be kept in good sanitary
condition, merely by a little energetic and
honest health-policing and by enforcing the
building and lodging-house laws already in
existence. Make the owners of the property
pay a special licenseÂ»tax out of their enormous
rentals, use this to provide a special sanitary
inspector, and the thing is done. Chinese
stand in holy fear of the law and its offices, and
one or two lessons would be enough. They
take very kindly to overcrowding; if permitted
they will take a room or Mor, "split" it into
two stories, if the ceilings are more than twelve
feet high, by putting in an extra Mor six feet
above the original one. If the ceiling is lower,
they build tiers of bunks clear to the top, with
perhaps a gallery four feet below it. These
quarters are then sublet to a dozen or a score
of sub-tenants. But a fewurrests and a tear-
ing out of these "improvements" would soon
stop all this. They do not love overcrowding
and dirt for their own sake, but merely put up
with them to save money; the rooms of the
more intelligent and wealthy Chinese are often
light, airy, and spotlessly clean.

Many disgusting things are to be seen in our
Chinatowns, but nothing that cannot be
matched in any city slum or "tenderloin."
