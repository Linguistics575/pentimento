 

A NEGRO'S UPHILL CLIMB 0199

from my engagement with him. His reply
showed his feeling about colored boys going
North to work. He expressed his gratilication
that Hampton needed my services and said that
he had been afraid that I might become so
attached to Northern city life that I would re-
main there rather than stay in the South and
work among my own people, as he was anxious
that I should do.

I had never before taught Indians. I had
been with them for four years, in the classroom,
on the parade ground, in the dining-room, on
the playground, etc., and had some very intr,
mate friends among the young men; but I was
now for the first time to learn the Indian's
point of view and to note how different it was
from my own. It was surprising to observe
how hard it was for many of the Indians to
adapt themselves to the white man's civiliza-
tion, and many of them actually felt that the
old ways were better. This was a new ex-
pcrience for a Negro, fer my people think that
the white man's way is the only proper way,
and we had tried to adapt ourselves to the
white man's methods. I learned for the first
time to really sympathize with another race and
one, too, that was more nearly on the plane of
my own and whose difficulties seemed to be
much greater.

My duties included the clerical work in the
Commandantâ€™s office, the supervision of the
drills, and the instruction of the battalion in
tactics. Mr. Freeland was a man of remark-
able ability and very methodical, and this
year's experience was invaluable. My work
as Commandant of the school cadets for the
last sixteen years has been largely influenced
by my association with Mr. Freeland.

I went North with General Armstrong in
November as a member of the Quartet and also
as one of the speakers, helping to mise the
money necessary for Hampton's work. I had
gone the previous spring on a short trip to
Baltimore, Washington, and New York, but
this time we made a pretty thorough tour of
New England, going to Boston and many
other places that I had always wanted to see.
I used to argue with Mr. Frissell, who con-
ducted our news-items recitation during the
middle and senior years, over the relative im-
portance of Virginia and New York. While
the text-books spoke of the greatness of New
York, I believed Virginia was almost as great
and that Richmond and Norfolk, while not so
large, were quite as important as New York

City. During this trip we were returning on a
Sunday morning from Brooklyn. Mr. Frissell
pointed out Brooklyn Bridge, the elevated rail,
way and a number of the tall otlice-buildings in
New York and asked me if we had anything
like these in Virginia. Riding out one evening
to a meeting in Orange, N. J., I told Mr.
Frissell how interested I was in Central Park
and the Metropolitan Museum, especially the
Egyptain mummies and the Obelisk. He
asked me how these things compared with
those of Richmond and Norfolk! I finally
admitted that Virginia was not quite so great
as New York.

One of the most interesting incidents of this
trip was a dinner given in Troy, N. Y., by a
number of gentlemen who were members of the
first company that General Armstrong recruited
and took to the war. Their enthusiasm for
General Armstrong, who had been their cap-
tain, impressed me very much. While at
Stamford, Conn., we went to the beautiful home
of Dr. John Lord, where the Quartet was to
sing at an informal reception given to
General Armstrong. I remember being in-
troduced to Dr. Lord and how frightened I
was when some one whispered that he was the
Dr. John Lord who had written "The Old Ro-
man World" and "Beacon Lights of History,"
and how honored I felt at being in the home of
a man who had written books. He seemed so
simple and so much like General Armstrong
and Mr. Frissell that I was almost disappointed,
I had expected that a man so distinguished
would not think of shaking hands with me,
but he talked more with us than with any of his
guests and seemed very much interested in
what we had to say.

While riding with General Armstrong be-
tween Boston and Albany, he asked me if I
thought I could manage the discipline of the
school and if I could organize a battalion and
an oificer's court. He advised me to become
familiar with all phases of the work of the
Department of Discipline, and of the school
generally. I was much disturbed, feeling that
perhaps I had not been doing my duty. On
my return to Hampton, I consulted with Mr.
Frissell, and asked if he could give me any
idea as to what General Armstrong's advice
meant. He told me that Mr. Freeland had
resigned, that General Armstrong wished to
put a colored man at the head of the discipline,
and that they felt that I could do the work.
This was like a thunderbolt, for my idea was
