cities and adding to the horrors of congestion
which have already become so common-
place as to fail to make much impression upon
the more calloused of us. However sound the
arguments recently advanced by Professor
Willcox, of the Census Bureau, to the effect
that the herding of aliens in places like New
York and Boston is kept up only by new arrivals,
while the earlier comers gradually fuse with
the crountry's population at large, the fact
obviously remains that there is congestion and
that it does not automatically relieve itself
in any such degree as is desirable. Statistics as
yet give no evidence of an appreciable change
in the forces and conditions which have always
drawn our immigrant classes to the larger
cities and operated to keep them there.

Here are the cold facts, set forth graphically
in an accompanying, chart, for the past year.
Of the 1,100,735 aliens admitted, 374,708,
or over one-tld, claimed the state of New
York as their ultimate destination; 198,681,
or more than one-sixth, claimed Pennsylvania;

86,539, or about one-twelfth, claimed Illinois;
and 73,863, or about one-sixteenth, claimed
Massachusetts. A very large majority-how
large no one can say-of these people took up
their permanent residence in the four cities
of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and
Boston, or in the suburbs of these great popula-
tion centres. It is estimated that at least
seven-tenths of all immigrants admitted settle
in those portions of the country which are
already most densely inhabited. The move-
ment to deflect a considerable proportion of the
newcomers to the South and other sections of
the United States where white labor is in urgent
demand is interesting and not altogether url-
promising. Yet, granting it a large measure
of success, if the present enormous rate of
inilux is to be maintained, or indeed still
further augmented, it is difficult to see how the
cities and states of the North Atlantic coast,
so long the unrivaled haven of the home-
seeking and labor-hunting foreigner, will be
able to detect the difference.

LESSONS IN GOVERNMENT, GOOD HEALTH, AND THRIFT

HE last topic on which America is
looking for instruction is democracy.

On that point we hold ourselves pre-

pared to enlighten the world. Yet no one can
be long in Scandinavia without feeling that if
we ever thoroughly learned it, we are forgetting
the very first lesson in equality. Try it and
see. See if you do not catch your breath the
first timea shabby, humblu-mindcd Norwegian
cab-driver shakes you warmly by the hand when
you give him his fee. Theoretically, Amer-
icans are prepared to shake hands on equal
terms with the whole world, but in practice
there is a condcscension in the handshake we
offer to the man with the hoe. In America,
where the little stage-play of equality is under-
stood on both sides, we are unconscious of its
absurdity. But when you find yourself pat-
ronizing a Scandinavian-that touchstone of
sincerity-you fall suddenly ashamed. The

experience is tonic. The longer you stay on
the northern peninsula, the more you come to
feel that every one of the good things you
would like to see copied at home is based upon
that very creed which we are forever pro-
claiming to the whole civilized world. There-
fore, the first lesson you wish impressed upon
your own people is this; More honesty in
our democracy.

Because they really believe in equality as an
ideal worth struggling toward, the people of
Scandinavia have developed a quick and grow-
ing sense of social responsibility. Things we
here call privileges there pass as rights. They
are not afraid of names; "paternalism" and
"socialism" do not scare them. Everybody's
rights-the rights of women as well as of men,
of farmers as well as urbanites, of the poor as
well as the rich, get recognition. Much that
in America goes under the name of philanthropy
