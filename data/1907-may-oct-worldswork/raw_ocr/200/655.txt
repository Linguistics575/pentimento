OUR TOWN LIFE-WHAT IS IT WORTH?

notably Mississippians, Georgians, Tennessee-
ans, Kentuckians, and, most notably, Missouri-
ans. Our non-American population was mostly
Scandinavians, Chinese, and the remnant of
the Mexicans who had once held the state.
The "Chinks" and the " Greases" colored
our life the most: the former with their utter
foreignness; the latter with the words we used
that were not used in the East. We spoke of
a cowboy as a vaquero, we did things pronto
instead of quickly, and in many other common
words used the remnants of the once universal
language of the state.

In those days-fifteen years ago-were men
active in business who remembered when our
valley was desert, when the Indians had mas-
sacred one of the overland prairie schooner
caravans here, when vigilance committee law
was the only law, and when the first irrigation
ditch made life below the foothills a practicable
existence.

Our industries then were primitive. The
oldest fortunes in our town were made by men
who drove their flocks of sheep to the mountains
in summer and to the foothills and valleys in
winter, and who, for months at a time, had no
companions but a couple of dogs and some,
times a Bible. A few of them still sursrive--
soft-voiced, slow-spoken, black-tarmed by our
fervent sun, their eyes squinted with years of
shielding them against the glare. Today most
of their magnificent free ranges are under
cultivation or are closed against them by fenced
cattle ranges in the mountains.

Our other great industry in those days was
wheat-growing. Unfeneed miles on miles of
grain stretched out to the horizon on our level
valley floor-owned by the section (square-
mile), by the thousand acres, and in one or
two instances, ten thousand acres. Now the
wheat kings, too, have lost their kingdoms.
Orchards, vineyards, dairy farms, have broken
up the great estates into smaller ranches, which,
by the way, with the intlux of new population,
are gradually coming to be called "farms."
The expansive glory of our past is succeeded
by more intensive and diversi5ed industries.

Fifteen years ago we were beginning to feel
the change-especially in politics. The pioneers
remembered when the first Republican vote
was cast in the county, and that armed Demo,
crats had tried to find who cast it that they
might run him out. Now there were enough
Republicans to support a daily paper, and to
cast a respectable vote at elections. Our popu-

lation was increasing fast, but immigration from
the South was at a standstill. Our new
settlers were from Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and
most largely from Illinois. Their political
influence was changing the vote of the county
until to-day it is pretty evenly divided, with a
general leaning toward the Republican side.

Their influence in education, too, was soon
visible. Among them were many graduates
of Yale and Harvard and Ann Arbor-heirs of
the New England tradition of education in
public schools, with a grafting of Middle
Western ideas of pronunciation tacked on to it.
Where we youngsters had droned our lessons
in the soft, r-less speech of our fathers, we were
soon nervously calling a dog that unspeakably
atrocious d-Yankce o-g, instead of our old
friendly, euphonious "dawg." "Coffee" went
the same path, and our parents jeercd or
groaned. But when they were addressed as
motherrrr and fatherrr indignation took the
place of ridicule. But there was no help for it,
and the other luckless youngsters of Southern
parents who have succeeded us, both by precept
and by the example of their Northern play-
mates, have had torn from them their birthright
of the most pleasing speech this country knows.
Only some of the girls-like most women, more
conservative of habit and tradition-retain the
accent of their mothers.

But the methods of teaching generally have
changed with our pronunciation. We have
adopted all the latest wrinkles in pedagogy.
We have gymnasium work every day. We
teach manual training, as an elective study in
the grammar grades and high school. We
have nature study classes that go botanizing
or zoologizing about the edge of town, and that
dissect frogs in the class-room. Our high
school students talk glibly of the chemical
"lab." and the physical "lab." They publish
a school paper every month, written and
edited by the students. They have a "student
body," an organization that controls the paper,
school athletics, the school orchestra, and other
student activities. The town supports a
"parental school," which gives special attention
and instruction to truant, wayward, or back-
ward children. Our teachers attend summer
schools and teachers' institutes and otherwise
display an amazing activity and interest and
initiative in their work, compared to our
plodding teachers of fiftccn years ago. Verily
the influcncc of Massachusetts has done us
wondrous things.
