ARTHUR W. PAGE

WENTY-THREE years ago, Mr.

I William J. Hammer, an electrical engi-
neer, equipped his residence in Newark,

N. J., with electricity. On entering it, the
pressure of his foot on the first step lighted the
bulbs around the number over the door. The
next step rangthc front door bell, and the third
automatically opened the door. By putting his
foot upon a small rest and pressing a pendant
bulb, he set two small brushes at work cleaning
his shoes. When he reached the top of the first
flight of stairs, the light in the hallway went out
and the light in his bedroom was lit; and it, in
tum, went out when he laid his head on the
pillow. Part of the cooking in this house was
done by electricity and seven different musical
instruments were electrically played. Mr.
Hammer decorated a Christmas-true with thy
electric lights instead of candles. He sent up
rockets, Roman candles, and other fhvworks
by electricity. At a dinner given to the
Franklin Society, a phonograph inside a life-
sized figure of the philosopher repeated the
sayings of "Poor Richard," and a tiny circular

 

electric railway was employed to carry the
electrically cooked food around the table.

There are now many "clcctrical" houses.
