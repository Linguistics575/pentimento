thank those that save it." But the white man
takes up his burden as ever. Thanks from
those he saves he does not need; he demands
only the sympathetic attitude of his other
white brethren-and that at last Lord Cromer
won and hands down to his happier successor.
But England has educated the so-called
Nationalists in Egypt only to have them turn
against her, just as in India Britain has raised
the timid Bengali from dirt and oppression
only to see them lead the sedition and misre-
presentation of the peninsula against her.

THE OUTLOOK

But the pilot has been dropped and for a
moment men's interest centres round the new
helmsman. Strong as Cromer was strong,
strong as an elemental force, Gorst is not.
His strength lies in his gigantic knowledge of
every aspect of every question affecting Egypt
a knowledge, which, as was intended and
foreseen, has been solidified and extended by
his term of work in the Foreign Office in
London. Yet his lack of creative power is the
less to be deplored because Cromer has put
all things in such train that the exact policy
to be pursued at every point is for his successor
rather a tradition or a necessity than a choice.
For the future, it will be more a question of
manner than matter. The manner of Cromer
was superb. There was apparently no dis-
cussion: no one's name, not even the Agent's,
was put forward; unless it was advisable, there
was not even warning given, but the desired
end was secured. As we have seen, it was here
a case of closing elementary schools; there it
was a question of the spending of $30,000,000
and the destruction of Phila, to ensure the
permanent prosperity of the country. There
was scarcely a ripple on the surface as the
finances of Egypt were slowly pulled out of
the slough into which they had fallen; there
was no more advertisement than was inevitable
on the occasion of the publication of the
annual Budget.

Once and only once, there had to be a dis-
play. Egypt had lost the Sudan provinces
and bided its time for their recovery. The
time came, and Kitchener went up the Nile.
At a cost that was ludicrously small, the two
battles of the Atbara and Omdurman were
fought, the valley of the Nile was secured for
British influence, the Mahdi's supremacy was
destroyed, Gordon was avenged, and the upper
lands of the Nile returned again to be admin-

 

CROMER, MAKER OF EGYPT

istercd in Cairo. Yet, even at this time,
Cromer's name hardly appeared; and after-
ward, while the great schemes he has inaugu-
rated were coming to fruition, in silence he
moved strongly about the vast spaces of Egypt.
He has touched nothing from the Great Lakes
to the Alexandrian breakwater which he has
not helped most powerfully.

Yet there are few men who claim to know
him, and the secret of his influence is kept
even from them. Those who are best ac-
quainted with his methods will often bewilder
a listener in attempting to describe his per-
sonality. After using many words, there still
remains the apparent inadequacy of Lord
Cromer's means, however fully they may be
described, to the ends he obviously attained.
This is a secret which cannot be imparted,
though perhaps it is the most important
secret of these modern days. For the time
has gone by when outward show produced
respect and smoothed the path of achievement.
Lord Cromer's strenuous retirement from
public observation not only facilitated difficult
passages with foreign governments, but was
own cousin to that impenetrable veil which
hid the personality and baffled the critics of
Lord Salisbury. Immense industry, wide views,
and a determination to achieve the aim rather
than to get the credit for it laid solid foundations
for such work as Lord Cromerâ€™s, but do not
catch the eye. Now, as after twenty-four
years of unremitting work he resigns the govern-
ment of the collection of half-civilized families,
clans, and tribes which he has made into a
state, the personal modesty of the man has in l
measure prevented the imagination of common
men from being stirred by his achievement.
Yet it cannot be too well recognized that
among the great administrators and creators
of mankind, Lord Cromer holds a place which
no other living man can claim to-day, and which
in its worth, degree, and permanence is not
less than that with which Bismarck, Garibaldi,
Clive, and Washington are associated in the
minds of men. What the future holds it is
impossible to guess, but never was a ship
launched with half the certainty of her holding
her own against the worst violence of the
troubled seas, than must now gladden Lord
Cromcr's heart as he steps down from the
bridge of the stout ship of his own construction
and gives over his life's work to the use and
care of a younger and more vigorous man.
And that is all he cares about,
