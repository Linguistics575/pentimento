Real Estate Company," advanced $40 to a small
sweat-shop owner of the East Side, taking as
security a chattel mortgage of $48 for ten
weeks upon his furniture. Three hundred pairs
of trousers were turned out of his shop each
week, for which the sweat-shop owner received
25 cents a pair. When the ten weeks had
expired, he could not meet the mortgage. The
company demanded $8 interest, and a new
mortgage for $48. This went on for two years,
the sweater paying $8 every ten weeks, until
more than twice the amount of the mortgage
had been paid, yet he W" never able to pay the
$40 at once. A dull season finally made it
impossible for him to meet even the interest.
The company threatened to foreclose and
remove his furniture. The landlord, to whom
he was in arrears for rent, threatened to dis-
possess him, and the loan company threatened
a criminal prosecution if he removed his furni-
ture. His seven children were without food,
and would soon be without a roof. In his
despair, he deserted his wife and children.
The half-starved wife, with all seven children,
the oldest being but thirteen years of age, came
to the Legal Aid Society. The landlord had
locked their rooms and taken the keys, and the
company was about to remove the furniture.
They were absolutely homeless. The Legal
Aid Socicty's lawyer took the family to the
municipal lodging-house, and then turned his
attention to the loan company. He instituted
proceedings which saved the furniture. The
woman was unable, of course, to make a living
for all seven children. The lodging-house
authorities found homes for all but the two
youngest. The mother sold all the furniture
but her own machine, and with that she has
started life anew. She can support herself
and the two children, and she hopes ultimately
to have all the children with her. The husband
has not been heard from. The tenth ward of
the city of New York has over 700,000 Jews
living in an area of some 110 acres, and many
of them can neither read nor write, and must
inevitably become the victims of all kinds of
sharpers. It is only by the utmost care that
the Society, located in this section, can learn
the truth of the stories brought to it.

The West-Side Branch is located on the edge
of the great theatrical district of New York and
to it comes much of the flotsam and jetsam of
that profession. Their troubles are often very
hard to adjust. In one case, a man had been
engaged as a chorus singer at the beginning of

DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF THE POOR

the season by a well-known manager and had
worked through a number of weeks at rehear,
sals; for this, according to the usual custom of
the profession, he was not paid. He was then
discharged because a new stage manager
decided that the chorus would look better if
composed of taller men. By this time, it was
too late to get another engagement for that
season. Without going into court, the Society
succeeded in persuading the manager to pay the
man for one-half of the time he had put in at
rehearsals. Most of the cases do not have to
be taken to court at all; of the 3,349 cases
brought to the Harlem Branch in 1906, it was
necessary to bring action in only about 350.

Another Case which, although not directly
in the line of Legal Aid, gives an idea of the
many phases of this work, was that of a crew
of thirty-seven Lascar seamen who were found
shivering in Battery Park, clad in tropical
clothing in the severest of December weather.
They had appealed in vain to the master of
their vessel for clothing more suitable to the
climate. Abdul Rahman, their leader, found
his way to the office of the Scamen's Branch
and laid his complaint before those in charge.
An appeal to the agents of the vessel brought
an advance of wages which, with a liberal
donation of clothing from the Protestant
Episcopal Missionary Society, was sufficient to
clothe the coolies in garments more suitable to
the climate.

A girl called at the Philadelphia Legal Aid
office and said that she had been attracted by
the advertisement of a Newark concern which
promised employment at $10 per week for
addressing envelopes. Upon answering the
advertisement, she was advised that the address-
ing must be done on one of the company's own
make of typewriters, which would be fur,
nished her for $2.50. This sum, which repre-
sented almost a wcek's work, she borrowed
from a friend and forwarded. When the
typewriter arrived, it proved to be made of tin
and became entirely useless after a few letters
were addressed. The company then refused
either to pay the promised salary (on the ground
that the girl had not done the work specified)
or to take back the typewriter. The Society
succeeded in recovering the full amount.

One freezing day in February, a German
sailor, who could not speak English, landed in
Philadelphia after a long voyage; he was
promptly captured by a "crimp," and sold to
the captain of a most undesirable outbound
