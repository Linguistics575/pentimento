A NEGRO CO LLICC, r',

for the Xenia markets, has a farm of loo acres
in the neighborhood. James E. Smith, of
the class of 1891, a carpenter by trade, has a
farm of 100 acres near the school.

Among other homes are those of James
P. Maxwell, treasurer of the College, who has
lived here for tiventy-five years; Horace Tal-
bert, who has been for ten years secretary of
the College; Mrs. S. T. Mitchell, wife of a
former president of the College; James Mas-
teison, whose house is now occupied by Lieu-
tenant Davis, teacher of military tactics, and
Edward H. Clark, professor of physics and
astronomy. He is a descendant of a family
that came out to Cincinnati from Virginia at
an early day, members of which have been
connected with the University almost since its
foundation.

Among the other members of the cam snity
who have been attracted to Wilberforce by the
advantages that it offers as a place of residence
and the opportunities for education of their
children, is Thomas Perkins, a retired farmer
from Mississippi. Mr. Perkins is the owner of
a plantation of 1,200 acres near Belzona, on the
Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. He
was employed for a number of years as a laborer
on the farm he now owns. At the death of the,
owner the heirs first rented it, and finally sold
it, to Perkins. He managed the property with
such thrift that he was able to pay$zo,ooo for
it within a period of about six years. After he
had acquired the property he was induced to
come North on account of malaria, and
decided to settle in Wilberforce, where he could
conveniently give his children the benefit of an
education. Mr. Perkins is now a man of
in: Tendent means. He has a fine house,
surrounded by wide lawns, and has been living
for some years past on the earnings of his
Mississippi plantation, which has greatlyin-
creased in value in recent years.

One of the most successful farmers in the
neighborhood is J. Fowler, who owns 150
acres a few miles from the College. Fowler
and his wife walked over the mountains from
Virginia in 1860. He worked as a farmland
in the neighborhood of the College in the early
days, and has, as he says, "dug his fortune out
of the earth." He lives in a fme old country
place, built of stone and bearing the date 1821
carved over the entrance.

Another farmer, who came to Wilberforce
community some years ago to educate his
children, is J. J. Turner, who, with his sons

TOWN 9367
Arthur and Cyrus, conducts a dairy farm of
some 200 acres not far from the school. They
have a dairy herd of 250 cows and dispose of
their milk and butter in Springfield. Cyrus
Turner went to the State University at Colum-
bus, after his graduation at Wilberforce, and
devoted himself for several years to the study
of agriculture. They have a fine home, which,
like most of the ether farms in this vicinity,
is connected with Xenia by telephone, and are
rapidly increasing a fortune that is already
considerable even for an Ohio farmer. They
sell about 500 pounds of butter fat a month in
Springfield, and secure two cents a pound
premium on each pound of their product.
Cyrus Turner received the highest mark at
college in the butter-making contest, and his
scientific knowledge, added to the practical

. experience of his father, has contributed to the

business success of the dairy farm.

Linked as it is by its history with the past and
possessing for colored people a certain historic
interest as the first college established in this
country by Negroes, and for many years al-
most the only college exclusively for Negroes
north of Mason and Dixon's line, Wilberforce
occupies a position of importance in the
rapidly increasing population of the southern
section of Ohio.

In the county adjoining it is Springfield,
the scene of the race riots of 1905. To the
west is Dayton, the city in which the late Pauli
Laurence Dunbar, the Negro poet, was born
and raised. The constant, steady influx of
Negro immigration from the southern shore of
the Ohio River has brought to this whole region
of southern Ohio, under somewhat changed
conditions and with different motives, the same
struggle for the adjustment of the races that
one meets elsewhere. If in other parts of the
country Negroes'have been made to feel that
they were alien and intruders, here, where they
are firmly planted in the soil, they have been
able to feel at home.

One of the subtle charms of Wilberforce is
that in this place a people that for almost
250 years has been almost without a tradition
of its own is beginning to make a history.
This is, no doubt, why so large a number of
the students who have gone out from here into
the world have returned to make their homes.
It is one of the things that make the Negro
communities that are growing up elsewhere
in the South and in the West interesting and
important.
