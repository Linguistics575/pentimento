A TOWN OWNED BY NEGROES

committed by strangers or by men who had come
into town from the surrounding community.
Twenty-eight cases were either never tried or
were of so trivial a nature that no fine was
imposed. Sixty-four were cases of disturbing
the peace.

It is interesting to read the records of the
mayor's court. They are an index to the life
of the village and reflect the changing current
of public opinion in regard to the moral dis-
cipline and order of the town.

In July, 1902, the records show that fourteen
persons were arrested and fined for failure to
pay the street tax. Every citizen of the town
is required to do $3 worth of work on the
streets every year. Some had neglected to pay
this labor tax and allowed the streets to fall
into a condition of neglect. As a result of a
discussion of the matter in the town council,
a number of the delinquents were arrested and
compelled to pay fines amounting to $3.30
and costs amounting to $1.40, each.

Again, in 1904, a man was arrested for
gambling. He had established what is known
in sporting parlance as a "crap" game, and
on Saturday nights a number of the young men
of the village were accustomed to gather at his
place to gamble. He was repeatedly warned
and finally the town marshal and some of the
more substantial citizens made a raid upon the
place and arrested fifteen persons. The cases
were dismissed-after each man had paid a fone
of $2. A year later, another man was arrested
for running a "blind tiger," selling liquor with,
out a license. He formerly owned a store in
the town but began selling liquor, then com-
menced to drink, and was rapidly "going to the
dogs." After his place had been closed, he
went out into the country and took up farming
again. It is reported that he is doing well
there.

During the year 1905, there were several
disturbances in the town which were traced
directly to the illicit liquor sellers. Men
would come into town on Saturdays to do their
marketing, fall to drinking, and end in a fight.
Things became so bad at last that a public
meeting was held in regard to the matter. As
a result of this meeting, the town marshal,
the mayor, and the treasurer were appointed
to get evidence and secure the conviction of
those who were guilty. Six persons were
convicted and fined at that time. One of
these, a woman, left town. Another is still
under suspicion and the rest, now on their farms,

have become respectable citizens. To my
mind, the interesting fact in regard to these
prosecutions is that they served not merely to
correct a public abuse but to reform the men
who were prosecuted. In most cases, these
men went back to the farms and became useful
members of the community.

It seems to be pretty well agreed that the
moral conditions of the Mound Bayou colony
are better than those in other Negro settle-
ments in the Delta. Some years ago, when
the question was an "issue" in the community,
a committee was appointed from each of the
churches to make a house to house canvass of
the colony, in order to determine to what extent
loose family relations existed. The report of
this committee showed that there were forty
families in the colony where men and women
were living together without the formality of
a marriage ceremony. As a result of this
report, the people of the town gave notice that
these forty couples would have to marry within
a certain length of time or they would be pros-
ecuted. Nearly all of them acted upon this
suggestion; the others moved away.

"Since then," said Mr. Montgomery, in
speaking about the matter, "we have had no
trouble of this kind. Upon occasions, the
women who are conspicuous in towns and
cities and who travel in the Delta, making the
various camps on pay-days and who more or
less infest the larger plantations, have tried to
get a footing here, but have never succeeded.
They can get no place to stay and have to leave
on the next train. This is now generally
known and we have no trouble on that score."

When I asked Mr. Montgomery how he
explained the fact that they had been able to
obtain such good results in the way of order
and morality among the people of the colony,
he said: "I attribute it to the force of public
opinion. The regulations that we enforce
have public sentiment behind them. The
people recognize that the laws, when they are
enforced, represent the sentiment of the com-
munity and are imposed for their own good.
It is not so easy for them to realize that where
the government is entirely in the hands of
white mem"

One thing that has helped to maintain order
in the colony is the fact that Bolivar County
prohibits the sale of liquor. More than once
the liquor men have attempted to pass a law
that would license the selling of liquor in the
county. Some years ago a determined effort
