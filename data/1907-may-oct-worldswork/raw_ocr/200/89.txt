 

WHAT SCANDINAVIA CAN

is called in Scandinavia merely social justice
and is accomplished largely out of the public
purse.

So much may be said of Scandinavia as a
whole. But we are here dealing with three
peoples, three temperaments, three exchecquers.
When seeking specific examples of applied
democracy, we shall iind them first in one
country of the trio and then in another.

B0DV-BULLDING IN SWEDEN

Sweden, for instance, can teach us a broader
conception of the term "public health." The
health we foster publicly in American cities is
but the absence of disease. In Sweden, health
means something more than not-sickness; it
stands for physical well-being, soundness,
splendid vigor. Without for a moment neglect-
ing medical precautions, it attacks the positive
side of the question-"How to insure to every
Swede his natural birthright of abounding
vitality."

The answer, as everybody knows, is Exercise.

But we do not all know how far Sweden
carries that creed. Exercise, gymnastic exer-
cise, not mere walking, is a religion. The
very criminals under sentence must have it,
and therefore full instructions for daily gym-
nastics are posted even in the condemned cell.
As soon would they think of depriving a male-
factor of his Bible as of his "day's order."
Grown folk must have it, and therefore the
gymnasiums spring up as thick as mushrooms.
The children must have it; therefore, when
the State has done all that it can for them
physically, private associations take them up.
Free skating rinks and toboggan slides-even
free toboggans and skates for the slrateless-
are provided less with the end of giving the
children joy than of promoting that fetish of
the Swedish soul-public health. Associa-
tions for outdoor games take charge of the
public playgrounds, organizing so-called peda-
gogic games that are not only uproarious fun
but develop swiftness, precision, and snap.
With government aid, these societies send
teachers of games to all the common schools
and the children are turned loose in the open-
air every day for a short romp. We use these
Swedish games in our gymnasiums and in such
of the public schools as can command the
space. Why not use them out-of-doors and
make them universal?

The Swedish Government itself takes splen-
did care oi the muscles of its little citizens.

Every school-child in the kingdom is under
bonds to learn to swim, unless, as is rarely
the case, the schoolhouse is too far from any
water. The Swedish small boy is more likely
to be provided with swimming trunks and
forced into the water than, as with us, arrested
for going in without them.

As for the formal gymnastics in Swedish
schools, it is a very serious affair; for it is
body building. One system (the Ling) pre-
vails throughout the kingdom, and even in the
country schools the teachers are all experts.
A Swede would as soon think of letting a med-
ical student experiment upon his liver as of
permitting a teacher to meddle with his chil-
dren's muscles without a ccrtiVate from the
Royal Institute. The worship of the Ling sys-
tem may be ludicrous, but the American no-
system is not less absurd. Think of the young
women who, "take up" Delsarte or whatnot
and are permitted to teach. Think of the over-
worked grade teachers who are considered good
enough to educate the bodies of the children
in the public schools. True, experts sometimes
teach these luckless teachers to teach the chil,
dren to wave their arms and legs. But you can-
not make good gymnasts, theoretical or practical,
out of the rank and frlc of stiff or Mbby school-
maâ€™ams. The bodies of young Americans are
not "built''-they just grow.

The rugged children of Sweden are a Cor1-
vineing recommendation of the national
method. In agility, poise, and grace, to say
nothing of physical stamina, they are far in
advance of our school children. A bigger
investment in scientific physical training in
our schools would pay dividends in the shape
of a steadier nervous organization, a sounder
physique.

When a Swede gets his body built, he does
not leave off there. What the club is to an
American business man, the gymnasium is to
the Swede. He takes exercise suited to his
age to keep in condition; or if ailing, puts into
the nearest gymnasium for repairs. The
movement cure and massage-thes are his
substitutes for nostrums. Headaches, liver-
complaints, nerves, dyspepsia are all treated,
at least partially, by active or passive gym-
nastics. That is, the Swede either exercises or
lies down and permits an attendant to exercise
him.

Medical gymnastics after the Swedish model
are more and more coming into favor with
American physicians. But middle-aged Amer-
