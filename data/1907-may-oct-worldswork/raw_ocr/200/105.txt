tortures and has offered destructive opposition
to suburban prosperities.

But to his family secrets. Let us start with
a basket of mosquito eggs. There are from
200 to 400 deposited by a mother mosquito at a
single laying. These eggs are about one-
sixteenth of an inch long, dark in shade, and
at the larger end having a sort of bottle-mouth,
which is sealed with a thin delicate membrane.
Out of this stoppered orifice will emerge the
larva or "wriggler" when hatching time ar-
rives. The eggs have remarkable endurance.
They can remain in cold-storage all winter and
hatch out in the balmy days of spring. Even
the mother-hen mosquito, with developing
batch of eggs, can spend the winter in a cake
of ice and go a-laying in the thawing days of
March.

The larva, if he is to enjoy anything of a

 

career, must find himself "in swimming"

Some mosquito families have advanced the
science of reproduction to the highest notch
and render the first steps in a larva's debut
easy; the entire batch of eggs is stacked up
like a lot of ten-pins, side by side, with the
large ends next the water. These eggs, all
glued together in the stacking, will then float
like the leaf of the water-lily on the water's
face.

This is called an cg/g-boat. For a couple of

days this lying-in house-boat will drift aim-
lessly at the mercy of wind and tide like a
derelict on the much-salted seas-its destiny
