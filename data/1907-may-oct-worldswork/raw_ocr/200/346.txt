9144 TAFT:
a curiously Democratic utterance from a prob-
able Republican nominee for the Presidency,
especially as contrasted with the only Demo-
cratic candidate's fervid desire for centralization
through the Government ownership of railroads.

The undergraduate, however, did not give
all his political thought to the nation. With
"the choice lot of boys from Andover," a
clique was formed that controlled matters in
their class, and then pretty much in the whole
University. Then Taft showed himself a
clever amateur at practical politics. This
does not mean that he was starting the career
of a political gamester. He simply played the
college political game out of pure zest and love
for the college.

At this time there was considerable animosity
aroused because of the two senior societies,
and in Tait's senior year "the Neutrals''
organized against them. Now Mr. Taft's
father had helped to found one of these socic-
ties, "the Skull and Bones," back in 1832, and
the honor of membership naturally fell to the
son, though it would have come in any case.
When the election for class orator came on,
the two societies, of fifteen members each out
of a class of 120, found "the Neutrals" arrayed
against them. But the societies put up Taft for
orator, and after the vote, Taft was declared
elected. Then someone charged trickery,
whereupon Taft wrathfully demanded another
election. He could not accept the honor under
a cloud. The second election only' increased
his majority. "The Neutrals" wanted him,
too, and he stood for his class as orator.

His oration was pronounced "a good,
strong, substantial piece of work." It was not
very notable for style, or graceful periods,
or particular brilliancy; but it was clear and
logical, free from rambling side issues;
yet, most of all, it produced effect because of
his earnestness and sincerity. He stood second
in the class of 120, and was salutatorian.
William H. Taft had done creditably the first
big job of his life~that of getting educated.

THE LOYALTY OF Hrs CLASSMATES

One thing further should be noted, since
it is a finger of prophecy, pointing from his
college life into the future. The thing is this:
it got to be the common idea, even among so
promising a generation of Yale men, that
"Bill'' Taft would rise high in the nation.
The idea became a matter of course, a creed,
and afterward, a Yale tradition. Once grown

A CAREER OF BIG TASKS

to college age, Taft no longer announced that
he was going to be President. In the modesty
of added years, an ambition like that seemed
absurd and was to be forgotten with. all
reverence. But his classmates announced it
for him. However curious this seems, the
thing was obvious to them and they believed
it firmly, and continued to believe it. They
have always been intensely loyal and enthusi,
astic in his behalf, and ever ready to fght for
him. So long ago as the Minneapolis Con-
vention (the one which nominated Benjamin
Harrison the first time), when the party was
shifting desperately around to fnd "a black
horse," two Yale men of '78 wired to a third
man of '78, the latter being prominent in the
Convention:

" Now is the time!”

They wanted to nominate "Old Bill" for
the Presidency of the United States.

But there remains for us to trace the busy,
useful life of the stalwart young graduate who
left Yale in 1878.

For the present we add his own words, that
he took "the step downward that has to be
taken from the altitude of the senior year to the
sense of insignificance that comes quickly to
the ordinary graduate in the year succeeding
his college life." "It is a year," he says
further, "that adds much to the graduate’s
usefulness in his community, and restores his
sense of proportion."

Young Taft's sense of proportion was re
stored in his father's law office in Cincinnati,
and there he experienced "the humbling
change from the estimate of the college world
to the estimate of the world at large." About
his own conception of the world at large, sug-
gesting the buckling on of armor and the im,
patience of the untried warrior-suggesting,
too, his unvarying attitude, that of industry,
monumental industry, we have again his own
statement, in the following clear-cut words:

"The young man most to be congratulated is he who has
been given an education as thorough and as useful as he
himself wishes to make it, and then under the spur of
necessity enters upon a life of work without the temptatiy1
to lack of effort and idleness which a competence always
creates."

Again he was lucky. But he deserved it.
Henceforth, as we shall see, his luck and his
deserts continued in the refreshingly and
poctically justifiable way that so rarely happens
outside of books written for growing boys.
