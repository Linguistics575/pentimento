 

FRICK, THE SILENT

closed: Mr. Frick was his logical successor.
Having done much to build this great industrial
structure, he would inherit the title of its king.
He would organize a company to buy out Mr.
Carnegie, and he would become in name as
well as in fact the leader of the steel industry
of the world. With him in the management
of the company were a score of young men,
afterward called "the young geniuses" by
Mr. Carnegie, but none of them, Schwab,
Gayley, Corey, or the others, measured up to
Mr. Friek in wealth or power.

With his gigantic ambition in mind, Mr.
Frick associated with himself the second
largest owner of steel stock, Mr. Henry Phipps.
Then, with the co6pcration of Judge W. H.
Moore and others, he asked Mr. Carnegie for
an option on his interests. Mr. Carnegie
demanded $1,000,000 for a ninety days' option,
and named $157,950,000 in cash and bonds
as the price for his entire holdings. This price,
with the additional cost of the stock of the
other partners, brought the cost of Mr. Frick's
scheme to about $250,000,000.

Mr. Frick invited a party of New York
bankers, including Mr. J. P. Morgan, to visit
Pittsburg. After they had examined the steel
works and had realized the tremendous volume
of their business, Mr. Frick unfolded to them
his scheme of reorganization. Never an effec-
tive speaker, his presentation of the prop0-
sition, involving practically a cash payment of
$250,000,000 for a business netting only about
$25,000,000 a year, did not impress Mr.
Morgan. Then the death of Governor Roswell
P. Flower of New York caused a depression in
Wall Street that dashed the last hopes of Mr.
Frick's syndicate. And to make more bitter
the blow to Mr. Frick's ambitions, Mr. Car-
negie, at the end of the ninety days, refused
to extend the option, and pocketed Mr. Frick's
million dollars.

HOPES DEFERRED

This was the first time in Mr. Frick's career
that he had failed to carry through a plan that
his judgment approved, and the blow to his
pride was staggering. He believed that Mr.
Carnegie intended deliberately to humiliate
him when he refused to renew the option, and
he has ever since dogged Mr. Camegie’s trail
with the same resolute persistency he has
shown in business.

Mr. Carnegie, in turn, resented Mr. Frick's
desire to succeed to his preeminence in steel,

and he was mortiMd that the failure of the
Friek syndicate left him in the position of
having been on the market with his holdings
which apparently could not be sold. He at
once undertook to oust Mr. Frick entirely
from the steel business. The method he
intended to use was the same method by which
he had maintained his control over the so-
called "debtor partners," who were the "young
geniuses" who had been admitted to the firm
for distinguished services.

When Mr. Carnegie wished to reward one
of his managers he was in the habit of giving
him a block of shares in the company under
an agreement called the "ironclad." By this
agreement the stock so given was carried on
the books in the manager's name, but it could
be forfeited to the company at Mr. Carnegie's
discretion upon payment to the manager of
the par value of the stock. By this arrange-
ment, the manager received the revenues of
his stock as long as he enjoyed Mr. Carnegie’s
favor, but he could be disciplined at any time
by the threat of its forfeiture, as the market
value of the stock was vastly greater than its
par value, and the profits from its possession
were proportionately great.

AT WAR WITH MR. CARNEGIE

After several quarrels with Mr. Frick, Mr.
Carnegie demanded that he resign as chairman
of the Board of Managers. Mr. Frick corn-
plied. Then Mr. Carnegie demanded that Mr.
Frick surrender his stock under the ironclad
agreement. This Mr. Frick vigorously de-
clined to do, pointing out that he was not a
debtor partner, as he had paid for his stock
with stock in the H. C. Frick Coke Company,
and that therefore the ironclad did not apply
to him. Mr. Carnegie then ordered the Board
of Managers to declare Mr. Frick's stock
forfeited at its par value. Mr. Frick replied
with a suit against Mr. Carnegie and the Board,
asking for an injunction to prevent the prac-
tical confiscation of his stock.

The war was now on in the open, and the
public learned of the bitterness within the
company. Mr. Carnegie's answer to Mr.
Frick's bill in equity contained reeriminations
and charges against Mr. Frick's personal
temperament. The public eagerly expected
new disclosures of the inside workings of the
steel business.

Then suddenly the lid was clamped down.
Peace was better than publicity. The case
