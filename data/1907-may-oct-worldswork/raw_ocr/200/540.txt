JAPAN'S WAR

A JAPANESE HOME IN TH

The burden at war taxes falls heavily on the peasants

tind means of livelihood anywhere. Thousands
of them are roaming the highways or starving
in the city slums. The fact that a Japanese
once in possession of a job cannot be dislodged
made it hard for the veterans to get the stay-
at-homes out of the places they preiimptcd
when the lighting men went to the front. These
poor fellows found that while cheered in the
streets they were politely but none the less
firmly rejected in shops and ofiicus. There
was no room for them. It is interesting to
follow the history of an individual known to the
writer:

Taki Tcnzaburo was one of the first of the
Tokyo 'rickshaw men to quit the prof1tablu
stand at the Shimbashi railway station and go
to war. He had been carning from twenty-fivc
to fifty cents a day, and was esteemed a very
lucky fellow. He sold his 'rickshaw to raise
money for the support of his aged father, whom
he left alone in the little house of a few mats
they rented not far from the busy station. After
sixteen months he returned, a sturdy, healthy
figure broadened and benefited by campaigning.
He wore his war medal proudly and marched
with his comrades along cheering lanes of little
men and women under canopies of flags and
felt himself more than compensated for his

sacrifices when the Son of Heaven reviewed the
army in Uyeno Park. Taki was happy; he
had offered his all to his country, and surely
good fortune pursued those who dared the
Patriot's death.

As soon as Taki was mustered out he hurried
to his home, which he found occupied by
strangers. His father had died a few days
before, and his effects had been sold to pay the
funeral expenses and doctor's bills. For a
time he was welcome everywhere and was
entertained by patriotic citizens who took
delight in receiving heroes of the great war, but
soon the enthusiasm died out and Tokyo
returned to its monotonous daily life. Taki
was unable to find employment, owing to the
glut of unskilled labor. In all that city of five
hundred thousand houses and two million souls
there was no niche for him. He could not
reenter the ranks of the â€™rickshaw men at Shim,
bashi station, as he had no money to buy or
rent a vehicle and to pay the $25 deposit re-
quired of those human coach horses who have
the monopoly of this rich territory. He found
the 'rickshaw coolies, discouraged by the com-
petition of the railroads, the tram cars, and the
