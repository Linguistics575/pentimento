TEACHING FARMERS TO FARM

THE SIMPLE AND DIRECT METHOD WHEREBY A MAN IS TAUGHT TO GROW TWO
BALES OF COTTON ON THE SAME LAND WHERE HE GREW ONLY ONE BEFORE

to a large number of men who them-

selves work farms-the present far-
mers-whereby they not only may, but will,
increase the product of their farms from 50
to 200 per cent.-this is a big thing to do. It
is one of the biggest things that could be done
for the enrichment of the country and for the
development of men. It has, in fact, been
called by a business man of one of our central
cities "perhaps the most important event in
modern times."

This is now done in several Southern states;
but the method is so simple that it seems almost
a waste of ink and paper to describe it; and
the wonder grows that it had never been hit
upon before. It is this:

A man, under the direction of Dr. S. A.
Knapp of the Department of Agriculture, goes
into a neighborhood where farmers are grow-
ing cotton as they have grown it for half a
dozen generations, producing, let us say, an
average of a third oi a bale per acre-for this
is the average throughout the whole cotton
area. He studies the neighborhood until he
finds a farmer of industry and of influence with
his neighbors. He goes to this farmer and
tells him that he represents the Department of
Agriculture of the Government and that he
would like to make an experiment on, let us
say, five acres of his land. The "demonstra-
tor," for this is what they call the traveling
teacher of agriculture, selects five acres, and
the farmer agrees to till it according to the
demonstrator's directions. The demonstrator
provides a plow, which will cut a furrow twice
as deep as the plow that the farmer has always
used. He instructs the farmer to hitch two
mules to it instead of one. He plows the
land in the fall. The farmer has, perhaps, not
been in the habit of doing this. Then he gives
him directions about fertilizing the land. In
most cases the fertilization is cheaper and
simpler than the farmer has been accustomed
to. Then, at planting time, the demonstrator
provides the seed with which these five acres
are planted. Of course, it is well-selected

seed. He gives other simple elementary in-
struction about the whole year's work.

When the farmer comes to gather his crop,
he observes that these five acres have produced
twice as much cotton as any other five acres in
his field. Then the demonstrator explains to
the neighbors just what has made the difference
--the simple devices of deep fall plowing, of
proper fertilization, and preparation of the
11nd, and proper seed selection. He has, per-
haps, taught no other lessons than these simple,
fundamental things. The result is that the
farmer has a demand for the cotton seed which
grew on those five acres, at so high a price that
he sells them alone for perhaps more than both
seed and cotton from any other five acres would
bring. Of course, the next year he cultivates
all his cotton land as those iive acres were cul-
tivated. Of course, too, the most teachable
of his neighbors cultivate their land in the same
way. As soon as they see that by their own
labor, and with the expenditure of practically
no more money, they can double the yield of
their lands-then the lesson is learned.

This system of instruction was first started
under the direction of Dr. S. A. Knapp in
regions of Texas where the boll weevil had
devastated the crop. The result was that the
farmers grew a cotton that matured sufficiently
early and was sufficiently hardy practically to
resist the weevil; and there is more cotton
grown now in those regions than there was be-
fore the weevil appeared. So completely suc-
cessful did the method turn out to be that the
Agricultural Department provided for the
application of it to cotton lands east of Texas,
anticipating the appearance of the weevil,
which travels steadily eastward at a rate of
somewhat less than one hundred miles a year.

The General Education Board, in cooperation
with the Department of Agriculture, is now
extending this kind of agricultural instruction
in states still further east-in Alabama, in
Georgia, the Carolinas, and in Virginia.

Of course, there are communities to which.
no demonstrators were sent by the Govern-
ment, which, having heard of these results,
