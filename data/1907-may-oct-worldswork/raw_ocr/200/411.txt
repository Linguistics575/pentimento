 

THE RAILROAD CONQUEST OF THE MOUNTAINS

Omaha up the Platte Valley, across the hills
through Salt Lake City, thence by the Hum-
boldt and Truckee Valleys to California. It
showed the camping places for each night,
indicated where grass, water, and wood could
be found, and marked the fords of the rivers.
It was not intended as a report of a railroad
reconnaissance, but it will serve to show the
variety of information gathered up by a skilled
railroad scout on a pilgrimage through a
country.

It was on a much later expedition that
General Dodge discovered the Sherman Pass.
He was coming back from the Powder River
campaign against the Indians. With six
troopers and a guide, he left his force and rode
miles along the ridge of the hills. His little
party was cut off from the main force by a
body of hostiles. All afternoon they rode for
their lives, holding off the Indians by rifle fire.
They came, at last, down into the level plains.

"I then said to my guide that if we saved our scalps, I
believed we had found the crossing oi the Black Hills--
and it was over this very ridge that the wonderful line was
built. For over two years all explorations had failed to
find a satisfactory crossing.

"In 1867 we located there the post of D. A.
Russell and the city oi Cheyenne. At that time, the
nearest settlement was at Denver, :50 miles away; and
while we lay there the Indians swooped down on a Mor-
mon train that had followed our trail, and killed two of
its men; but we saved their stock, and started the grave-
yard oi the future city."

These are but episodes of the recon-
naissance of the Union Pacific. They can
be duplicated from the history of every one
of the transcontinentals.

The original survey of the Canadian Pacific
route through the Rocky Mountains was as
difficult a piece of work as could be imagined.
The two ranges are very close together, and it
seemed simply impossible for any road to find
its way across them, on account of the great
depth of the narrow valley between them.
To-day, the trains pass through the eastern
range in the Kicking Horse Pass, and the
western range in the Eagle Pass. The former,
according to General Shcrman's statement,
was discovered by an American engineer
named Randolph, and was named from the
fact that his horse kicked him on the knee at
that stage in his wanderings. The passage of
this range had been practically given up, and
a great detour through Howse Pass was
intended.

Eagle Pass was discovered by accident.
General Sherman credits the same Randolph
with its discovery, but the records are against
him. Years before, when the Canadian cngi-
neers were seeking a route for a wagon road
from British Columbia, Walter Moberly, head
of a surveying party running the line from West
to East, was led by an cagle's flight through
this almost impenetrable range of the Selkirks.
He was on the point of turning back, weary
and discouraged from a long search for a
passage, when an eagle swept over his head and
on into the heart of the range. He followed
it around a great projecting corner, up a huge
rift in the side of the glacier-and then the pass
opened clear before his eyes It is that same
rift that to-day carries the rails of the Canadian
Pacific from the snows to the valleys of the
coast.

Many a mile of these great railroads was
laid beside the graves of the engineers. Down
in the heart of Mexico, in the rolling hills of
sand, there is a little group of graves, marked
by white crosses. They are merely a typical
tribute to the perils of reconnaissance in a
savage country. Four young American engin-
eers building the Mexican Central were caught
at that point in 1881 by the Apaches. They
fought until they died, fearing the torture.
Their names wore Fordham, Leavitt, Grew,
and Wallace; and that is about all that the
records show. It was but an incident-no
more-echoed in Texas when they shoved the
Texas Pacific through the Staked Plain; paral-
lelled in Idaho on the Northern Pacific survey.

THE PERILS OF THE SURVEY

The reconnaissance, however, is but a little
part of the location of a railroad through the
wilds. The survey follows it. In most cases,
the final route of a railroad across the ranges
threads the valley of a river. It is so that the
Denver & Rio Grande pierces the Rockies,
following the canyons of the Grand and the
Gunnison. Here it is that the engineer meets
other dangers than the hostility of man. Along
these frowning cliffs, towering to the snows,
the line must find at foothold. Great logs are
slung in chains above stream for men to stand
upon while they plot out the level of the ledge.
Sometimes men are dropped over the cliffs
to operate their transits and their levels from
the end of a rope, dangling above a torrent.

The life in the field is rigorous. From the
dawn come the feet of the engineers, up through
