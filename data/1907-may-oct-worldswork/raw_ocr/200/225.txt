A JOURNEY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN

STATES

TTIE FARM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, NEAR KNOXVILLE

It was the centre, very much as Charleston
was, of the extreme Southern sentiment for
many years after the war-naturally; but
that was long ago, and this political and social
feeling later came to act chieily as a wholesome
conservative force and has prevented the
spirit of commercialism from setting up new
standards. Solidity and dignity mark its life.
To persons who like character in cities as well
as in people, Richmond is one of the most at-
tractive places of residence to be found any-
where in the United States.

The hand of Industry has touched it, too.
From locomotive works to a baking-powder
factory, its manufactures have grown rapidly

-frorn 35 million dollars' output in 1895 to
70 millions,1ast year. Years and years ago,
somebody began to make cook-stoves there.
Now there are three big factories. In the
building of the old Libby prison soon after the
war, a man with one lathe began to make
tubs and pails of cedar. To-day, that factory
covers twelve acres of land, employs 2,000 men,
and owns 2,000,000 acres of timber-land, and
has its own railroads and barges and steamers.
More than half the blotting paper used in the
world is made in Richmond (so they tell you)
--$4,ooo,ooo worth of it. The manufacturers
buy rags in England, Germany, Sweden-
everywhere. The bank deposits in the city
