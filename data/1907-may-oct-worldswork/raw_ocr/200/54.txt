men began to draw in the lines of their busi,
ness, and cspccially to get out of their Sp2cu-
lative enterprises. Mr. Frick's partners joined
the rush to cover, and Frick & Company was
one of the concerns from which they struggled
to be free.

This was young Frick's opportunity, and he
demonstrated two of his vital characteristics:
faith in the ultimate returns from the possession
of any primary commodity of trade, and the
courage to back his faith. The uses of coke
at that time were few, but he saw a great future
for it.

Therefore, instead of abandoning his com-
pany, young Frick wrote to Judge Thomas
Mellon, a wealthy banker of Pittsburg, asking
for a loan of $10,000. Judge Mellon commis-
sioned Mr. J. B. Corey to go to the coke
district and report on the security offered by
this unknown would-be borrower.

THE FIRST FEAT IN FINANCE

At his destination Mr. Corey asked for young
Frick. He was directed to a little coke-
burner’s cabin nearby. The cabin he found
contained two tiny rooms, one used as an
office and the other as sleeping quarters; but
both were fastidiously neat and arranged with
systematic orderliness. Here he found a clean-
shaven boy, who admitted that he was the
author of the request for $10,000 The princi-
pal collateral he had to offer was the future
he believed to be in his business and his irwin-
cible faith in himself, in brief, his cool, quiet
"nerve." Mr. Corey spent the day and that
night with Frick. He found him alert, clear-
headed, straightforward. He knew the busi-
ness for which he needed money, and he
convinced Mr. Corey of its future. He got
the money. It was a good investment. Ever
since that time Mr. Frick's iniiuencc has aided
the Mellons, and to-day the Mellons National
Bank of Pittsburg is one of the most powerful
institutions in Pennsylvania. And the boy
to.whom Judge Mellon lent $10,000 on his
word Can burr?” T101000,000 to-day as easily
on the same security.

With this capital, Mr. Frick bought out his
timid partners. Coke was down to ninety
cents a ton. Other men in the coke busi,
ness as gladly sold him their coal beds and
ovens.

The panic subsided. The price of coke
rose to $4, even Si, a ton, and Mr. Frick's
holdings made him almost a millionaire before

he was thirty years old. In 1878 he sold an
interest in the business to Mr. E. M. Ferguson,
of New York, and later another interest to
Mr. Ferguson's brother. The business grew
in prosperity, without incident until 1882, when
it was reorganized under the name of the H. C.
Frick Coke Company, with a capitalization
of $2,000,000. The new company now owned
3,000 acres of coal beds and 1,026 ovens.

PARTNERSHIP WITff THE CARNEGIES

With the reorganization Mr. Frick entered
upon the second era of his career, and Cnu0un-
tered a personality that has supplied the motive
of much of his later life, first by encouragement,
next by rivalry, and later by open hostility
and warfare. The new era began with the
selling of a halrinterest in the H. C. Frick
Coke Company to Carnegie Brothers of Pitts-
burg. The personality that has influenced
Mr. Frick's career is that of Mr. Andrew
Carnegie.

Until 1882 Mr. Frick had been a dealer in
coke. Now, in exchange for an interest in
his coke business, he was admitted to the firm
of Carnegie Brothers, and began a new career
as a manufacturer of steel. This action was
a fair test of Mr. Frick's foresight in his coke
enterprise. His holdings had made him indis,
pensable to the Camegics in their expanding
steel business, where coke is necessary to reduce
the iron ores.

In 1883 the capital of the H. C. Frick Coke
Company was increased to $3,000,000. By
1886 the Camegies had acquired a majority
interest in the company through the retirement
of two of Mr. Frick's partners. In 1887, they
ordered a settlement with striking coke burners
that seemed to Mr. Frick to implicate him in a
breach of faith with other coke companies that
had combined to resist the strikers. Mr.
Frick therefore resigned from the presidency
of the H. C. Frick Coke Company, though he
retained his interest both in that company and
in Carnegie Brothers. An idea of the value
of his holdings in the former company (nearly
a half-interest) may be got from the fact that
it now owned 35,000 acres of coal lands, 10,000
ovens, 35 miles of railroad, and 1,200 cars,
and that it employed 11,000 men who produced
1,100 cars of coke a day.

The public estimation of Mr. Frick in 1889
may be suggested by the following quotation
from a biographical sketch published at that
time:
