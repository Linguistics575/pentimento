believe that they can work. Step by step they
must prove their ability. At the present time,
thousands of such American men and women
are living idle, dependent lives. The cause
of their unproductive dependence is the error
of not carrying their education far enough,
and of not providing, them with suitable employ-
ment. I can explain the situation by outlining
what seems to be the main tendency of the
education of the blind in Europe.

The effort there is to give them trarles and
handicrafts by means of which they can earn
their bread, or part of it. The aim of the best
European education is to make each individual
sclf-supporting. The blind require spccial
teaching to enable them to use the senses of
hearing and touch in the place of sight, to live
and toil in the dark.

ODD BELIEFS ABOUT POWERS OF THE BLIND

When philanthropists first approach the
problem, they expect that education will
develop in the blind extraordinary mental
capacities. They reason that blind persons
shut out from crery-day distractions will enjoy
great concentration of mind, and as a result
will be poets, musicians and thinkers. Such
was the dream of Valentin Haiiy in France
and Dr. S. G. Howe in Boston, and such to-das,
is the dream of the good Queen of Roumanic.
But experience taught Haiiy and Howe that
the poets, the musicians, and the philosophers
were not forthcoming. We have to deal with
a miscellaneous class of defective persons who
are often not only blind, but weak from the
very cause that destroyed their sight. From
confinement and want of exercise they are
often deficient in vitality and dulled in mind.
In such conditions of body and mind genius
can hardly ilourish. It is true that blind men
sometimes have the divine spark in them.
They have become distinguished in art, in
science, in literature. But whatever eminence
they have attained has been in spite of their
misfortune, and not because of it. The great
exceptions cheer and encourage us; but they
remain exceptions. The question is, what
shall be done with the uninspired majority.
In Europe it was soon determined that the
wisest course is not to direct their instruction
wholly toward things of the intellect, but pro-
vide trades and industries by means of which
they can earn a livelihood. The more advanced
schools of Europe try to give them an education
suited to their common intelligence and their

uncommon infirmity, and the work oi the
schools is supplemented and made practical
by societies which help them to put their edu-
cation to the best use as ordinary, industrious,
self-respecting citizens. The vicissitudes of
business are so complicated that they easily
miss their few chances of self-support, unless
they have special organizations to find positions
for them, to advertise their abilities and per-
suarle the community to give the blind musician,
or teacher, or broom-maker, or masseur, or
whatever he may be, profitable employment.
There are such organizations in Europe that
use every effort to bring industrial training
within the reach of all the blind, and are the
channels through which the true end of edu-
cation and charity for the sightless is achieved

NECESSITY FOR BUSINESS TRAINING

In America, where the struggle for existence
is less severe, and where money is more plenti-
ful, we have been long coming to realize the
necessity of fitting, each individual for a self-
supporting life. Our education has been
administered to all children alike, without
regard for their capacities or circumstances.
Consequently most children leave school un-
prepared for a trade or industry or profession.
This general state of American education has
complicated the difficulties of the sightless.
Excellent schools for their instruction, estalr
lished on sound principles, have existed since
1832 when the first institutions for the blind
were opened in Boston and New York. But
they have laid little or no stress upon industrial
training. Their system of education has the
same faults as that in the ordinary American
schools for the seeing. Besides, our ir1sti-
tutions for the blind are intended for children
and youths, and have not taken very much
interest in the adults. Until recently we have
had nothing which corresponds to the societies
for the blind in Europe, and the associations
which have lately been formed in two or three
American states are scarcely beyond the stage
of tentative effort.

One great difficulty of the adult blind is,
that of the thousands of occupations in which
men engage7 only a very few will ever be pos-
sible for the sightless. The occupations in
which they have already succeeded are the
manufacture of mattresses, brooms, brushes,
mats, baskets, some simple kinds of carpentry
and weaving, cobbling, typewriting, piano-
tuning, massage, knitting, crocheting and plain
