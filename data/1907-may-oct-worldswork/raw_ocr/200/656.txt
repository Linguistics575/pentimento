Our boys and girls are correspondingly more
eager for the benefits of education, and they
use much energy to obtain them. The boys
work during the summer vacation in the vine-
yards, orchards, canneries, and stores, to earn
money for the next term at college. The girls
who go are usually supplied with funds by
their families, but nearly all the boys, even
those whose parents could afford it, earn their
own way. The formula of our fathers is, tt You
may 'go' to college if you will-and we hope
you will; but if you have to be 'sent' it will do
you no good." We do not yet insist on educa-
tion for general culture, but when the getting
of it involves practical work and a display of
character, it is approved for those things alone.

Most of our college-bred boys come back
home and apply their learning to home prob-
lems, and the girls, as elsewhere, teach school
or marry. They haven't many other alterna-
tives-except to work in the stores or as clerks
in the courthouse, the latter being an occasional
variation of their usual course.

In those days there was still a good deal of
the crudeness of the frontier in our administra-
tion of justice. One old Missourian, justice
of the peace, in a battery case, discovered that
the plaintiff had called the defendant a liar,
and that the insult had started the assault.

"Do you admit calling the defendant a
liar?" demanded the old judge.

"Yes, sir," replied the plaintiff.

"Complaint dismissed," growled his honor.
"Where I come from, to call a man a liar is to
strike the fsrst blow. Defendant struck in
selrdefcnse."

In another case the attorneys for opposing
clients had persisted in threats of personal
violence upon one another, in spite of warnings
from the judge. At length the court's patience
was exhausted by their windy mouthings, and
he called out eontemptuously to the sheriff:

"Bailiff, announce a recess of ten minutes
while these damned fools fight it out."

There was no hght, and the case continued
in peace.

Our grievances were even, sometimes, settled
in true frontier fashion with knife or "gun"
on the streets, but I realize now that these
aifrays were no more frequent nor spectacular
than similar violence in New York City to-day.
They were not, however, always so severely
punished.

But to-day we are more decorous in our court
procedure, especially in sessions of the United

OUR TOWN LTFE--WHAT IS IT WORTH?

States District Court, where the majesty of
Federal power is awesomely present. And
our sheriff chases his criminal prey now in an
automobile which enables him to spread posses
over the county at an amazing rate.

In our city government we note a great
change. In those days, and for years after,
our city boss was a little Portuguese whose wife
taught him how to write his name after he had
been for some time a city trustee. Shrewd and
politic, he governed us to his own advantage
until we gerrymandcred him out of office by
cutting up his district so that each of five
parts of it was added to another more reputable
district. '

His downfall was part of a moral uprising
against frontier conditions in our town. We
had a large Mating population that came in
summer to pick fruit and to work in the packing
houses and canneries, and many of them were
a rough sort who wanted plenty of saloons
and places to gamble in. Then we had our
own fast element, who could not be satisfied
by our pure wines that we pressed by the
million gallons, but must have green beer and
the worst of bad whisky, as if our summers
were not already hot enough to fry a man's
brains out. In consequence, we had about one
saloon for every twcnty-five grown men of our
permanent population. Every saloon was also
a gambling place, where poker, faro, pedro,
keno, and the mechanical nickel-in-thc-slot-
machine card games were played to the accom-
paniment of piano or hand organ or music box
and boisterous laughter and coarse jokes and
loud cursing. Our downtown streets were not
pleasant for decent women. Our outlying
streets were not safe for any but armed men
after dark. Even our ancestral town function
of going to the post-office Sunday evenings at
fave o'clock was marred by the presence of
drunken and rowdy men and boys fresh from
Sunday horse-races and ball games and open
saloons. The hold-up habit got to be too
popular, even in the plaza at night. Our city
officials were corrupt and connived at some of
the disorder, and were otherwise incompetent.
With open drinking, open gambling, Chinese
lotteries, and other vices, we were a "wide
open" town.

Then the sober citizens who wanted to sleep
o' nights, to walk the streets when they chose,
without insult or assault, voted in a new city
charter, giving the town practically government
by commission, with almost complete authority
