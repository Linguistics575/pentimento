'bus. The motor 'buses also earn more-
$22.50 to $30 apiece, against $12.50 to $13.75
each for the horse-drawn 'buses.

The example of one company will show the
financial success of the system and its service
to the public. The gross receipts of the Lon-
don Motor Omnibus Company, Ltd., the
largest of the companies, for the eighteen
months ending June 30, 1906, were $624,690.
This company alone carried considerably
more than a million passengers a month for
twenty-rone months, without a single loss of
life. At the hrst annual meeting of the com-
pany, held on October 22, 1906, a dividend
of IO per cent. was declared on the ordinary
shares, after placing $30,000 to reserve, allow-
ing 20 per cent. for depreciation, and putting
$2,000 back into the business.

As a result of such facts as these, the business
is growing rapidly. Three hundred new 'buses
have been added to the service in the six months
beginning with October, 1906, and about 900
more are being built on orders from the transit
companies. Of the $5,000,000 invested in the
business, some $3,000,000 is represented by
the vehicles, at an average cost of $3,500 apiece.
And the companies already employ 4,000 men
in their various enterprises.

Another means toward a solution of the
transit problem is the taximeter cab service
of Paris. About three years ago, an automo-
bile cab fitted with a taximeter was put on the
streets of Paris, and the fare was regulated so
that it about equaled the fare of a horse cab.
A few months later, one of the big companies
ordered 250 small motor cabs of a special
type, all fitted with the taximeter. The
minimum fare was fdteen cents and about
twenty cents for each additional mile. These
cabs are silent, swift, and elegant in appearance;
they seat two or four persons, and may be made
mpen or closed at will. They were an instant
success. By the end of 1906, more than 1,000
were in use, and the outstanding orders will
bring this total to 2,000 by the end of this year.
The cabs are from 8 to 14 horse-power, and
cost about $1,500 apiece.

The taximeter system has largely made such
rapid progress possible. The taximeter is a
simple but ingenious instrument which auto-
matically measures the distance traveled and
indicates on a clock-like dial the amount of
fare to be paid. On entering the cab a small
metal flag above the taximeter is lowered and
immediately the figures "75'' appear on the

dial, meaning 75 centimes-equal to 15 cents,
the minimum fare. At the end of 1,300 yards,
the f1gures change to 85 centimes, or 17 cents,
and continue changing at regular intervals
until the passenger leaves the cab and the flag
is again raised. To-day, this system is used
exclusively and gives entire satisfaction. The
success of this system has led to the manufacture
of these cabs by one company in lots of 2,500.
At least two distinct companies are now pre-
paring to introduce French and American
taximeter cabs in New York City.

But New York has not yet obtained this
system, nor such cheap fares as the Parisians
pay. The nearest approach to this system--
which may have in it the beginnings of the
cheap and convenient transit of London and
Paris-is the service of one large company
in New York, which operates 650 electric
vehiclesihansoms, broughams, landaulets, and
vietorias. .

This motor cab service of New York is
exclusive. When one wishes to hire a cab or
brougham, he Must send his order to the cen-
tral storage station. Fare for the service is
charged by the driver according to a published
tariff. Roughly, the rates for hansoms and
two-passenger broughams range from 50 to
75 cents a mile and from $2 to $2.75 per
hour.

Four stations are maintained by this com-,
pany. They accommodate more than 700
vehicles. A destructive fore early this year
burned out the central portion of the main
station. This had the largest portable storage
battery room in the world; 500 batteries could
be charged at one time. There were half a
dozen hydraulic lifts that removed the batteries
from the vehicles and replaced them with
freshly charged batteries without either having
been touched by hand. Trains of small trucks
operated electrically, conveyed the batteries
from beneath the vehicles into the great bat-
tery room, where they were picked up by
enormous electric traveling cranes and moved
to any desired stands in the room. Plans are
being drawn for the reconstruction of this entire
station on an improved hreproof system. It is
probable, also, that about 200 of the electric
vehicles which were burned will be replaced
by gasoline cabs, all htted with taximeters, like
the cabs of Paris.

There is no motor omnibus service at present
in New York, except an experimental French
'bus in operation on Fifth Avenue from
