chilla that comes from the cool mountain
heights of Bolivia is just as superior to the
chinchilla that comes from the valleys of Peru
and the La Plata as the dark-brown beaver of
the far North was superior to the light-yellow
beaver that used to be found along the salt
lakes of Nevada and Utah. In fact, the fmst

where the beaver thrives best, has taken steps
to protect it, though It closed season in the true

Man shall have the right to hunt as long as
"the streams ilow and the sun rises." But the
white trader can discourage the Indian hunter

a heavy piece of nutria could easily be mis-
taken for a light piece of beaver. The dif-
ference is in the heaviness and natural curl and
gloss of the beaver. Both nutria and beaver
