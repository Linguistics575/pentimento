married men; the proportion has already risen
to 25 per cent. as a result of this campaign.

After the experiments at Hadleigh, Fort
Romie, and Fort Amity, no attempt has been
made in Canada to "colonize," in the common
acceptance of the term, for two reasons. First,
the lack of money; though a man may be
brought to the Canadian Northwest for $50,
at least $500 is required to give him a fair
start as a "homesteader." Second, the great
majority of colonizing enterprises on a large
scale have failed hitherto because of the in-
experience of the Colonist. Hence the policy
of letting the emigrant get his experience as a
"hircd man" in the more thickly populated
Eastern Provinces. And though the hired
man's lot has never been regarded as easy, it
is signiiicanthhat no "Army" emigrant has
asked to be returned to England.

But the movement was essentially to be a
transplanting to the wide fields, and'in the
present year it has been given the opportunity
to take full course in that direction. Large
donations of money are coming to the "Army,"
and both the Dominion and the Provincial
Government of Ontario have decided to do
their part 'in the matter of providing the
land.

In the case of Fort Romie, a committee of
the chamber of commerce of San Francisco
cooperated with the "Army" in the purchase
of the land. In the case of Fort Amity, it had
to be bought. But, in addition, there were
many other initial expenses. To start the
colonist with an honest chance of success, he
was provided with a twenty-acre holding, a
team of horses, a cow, seed, implements, etc.,
for which he gave a chattel mortgage. And
to build his house, he was loaned $300 in cash.
Only $25 of this was to be spent for actual
labor; each man was expected to build for
himself, or to realize the advantage of coopera<
tion. For every five colonists ignorant of farm,
ing work-and in the case of Fort Amity they
had been drawn from the tenements and had
been carpenters, teamsters, tailors, canvassers,
street-railway conductors, and the like-a
"pace-setter," a man of experience from whom
the other five might learn, was given a central
holding. This proved an excellent idea.

The "Army" has practically been given the
refusal of two great tracts of land in Canada,
amounting to nearly 500,000 acres, at a cost
of almost nothing. The first proposes the
settlement by the "Army" of two townships--

TRANSPLANTING A CITWS POOR

from 230,000 to 250,000 acres-in the northern
Ontario clay belt, along the line of the new
Transcontinental Railway. The clay belt con-
sists of some of the finest agricultural land in
Canada and enjoys a climate much milder than
the wheat lands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
The Ontario Government has not as yet given
out its final statement, but its attitude in the
matter is sufficiently guaranteed by the large
grants of money and other assistance which it
has already made to this unofficial Immigration
Department. It is understood that the coloniza-
tion agreement to be entered into between the
Province and the "Army" is about as follows:

The "Army" will obtain the land at some-
what less than the fifty cents an acre usually
charged settlers in these districts; and the
payments will also be extended over a term of
years, probably ten, without interest. Such a
price merely covers the necessary township
surveys. The "Army" agrees to settle im.
migrants of the best selected class upon allot-
ments of 160 acres. The Government will
appoint a number of expeJenced men to assist
members of the "Army" staff in locating the
settlers, building suitable homes, clearing the
land, and teaching the rudiments of agricul-
ture. The settlement will be gradual; there
is no idea of bringing in thousands of people
to live in tents or rough shanties. As a further
aid to the settlers, there will be an experimental
farm in Ontario, which will be a sort of agricul-
tural headquarters for settlers.

Sir Wilfrid Laurier's offer in the name of the
Dominion Government was of 240,000 acres
in the Northwest Provinces, on condition that
the British Government should stand behind
the movement. That condition will probably
be removed. On the occasion of General
Booth's visit to Ottawa in March of the present
year, both Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Earl Grey,
the Governor-General, foreshadowed in their
speeches, an "Army" colonization scheme
upon a gigantic scale with Dominion support.

The movement has already begun to spread
in other directions. A private land company
in Rhodesia has offered the "Army" a home-
stead grant of 1,000,000 acres free. The Gov-
ernor of British East Africa has set aside large
tracts of agriculturaliand along the line of the
Mombasa and Victoria-Nyanza Railroad. In
South Africa and the Transvaal, the "Army"
is regarded by the Imperialist Progressives
as the power that may yet reverse the present
pro-Dutch racial balance.
