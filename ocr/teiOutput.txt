         <p>EGYPT AS A WINTER RESORT.</p>
         <p>CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION.</p>
         <p>THIS handbook is a humble endeavour to answer the queries of some of my esteemed medical friends in England and in the United States, who tell me they are sometimes at a loss to know what manner of patients they ought and ought not to send to Egypt. But, apart from the actual needs of invalids and their professional advisers, there is a large class of visitors who either accompany delicate friends abroad, or flee from their own homes merely to escape cold weather and bask in the sunshine. It is obvious that a health-resort which provides a suitable climate for invalids and a sufficiency of interest and occupation for healthy individuals will become more and more popular. The national interest which England has taken in Egypt since 1882, the growing prosperity and civilization which have attended the efforts of her officials on the spot, and the improved facilities for travelling obtained by Messrs. Cook, have all tended to make Cairo and the Nile a very favourite winter resort. Some six thousand visitors come to Cairo during the winter months, and of these about twelve hundred proceed up the Nile in steamer or in dahabiyeh. To show that the climate deals fairly with these masses of visitors, it may be mentioned that the writer, in a medical experience of six winters, has lost only two patients who came to Egypt for their health. Both these were patients far advanced in consumption, who ought never to have left their homes, one an Australian, who reached Cairo at the beginning of 1888, and died there in February; the other, an American, who died in December, 1888, a few hours after reaching Cairo. This experience is not only a personal one, for the death register shows that there have been only nine deaths among British visitors in Cairo during the gig years ending June, 1880. Of these nine, seven arrived here ill of incurable diseases; the eighth was thought to be robust, but died of uraemic poisoning during her first week in Cairo; and the ninth caught a chill while out sketching, and died of double pneumonia. But the writer's object is not to try and prove that Egypt is the best health-resort in the world, but to give reasonable information about its climate to those who have practically decided against the respective merits of sea and mountain air, and are in search of pure dry desertair where min is almost unknown, and where fog, strong winds, and cold are never felt.</p>
         <p>At the outset it must be remembered that where the air is extremely dry, there the difference is the greatest between the maximum and minimum temperatures, for the sun's heat reaches the earth without difficulty by day, and again by night it disappears into space. Patients, therefore, can bask in Egypt in the temperature of an English summer by daylight, but must be prepared for autumnal cold after sunset. The summer months in England under favourable circumstances are well suited to those of feeble constitution, who can surround themselves in their own homes with modern luxuries, with the comforts which none but the English thoroughly study, and with all the pleasures of friends and family. But when the autumn cold requires such a one to take active outdoor exercise, for which he is not sufficiently robust, and when the absence of sunshine induces a depression of spirits in addition to his physical delicacy, he begins, if he is wise, to think of deserting his home comforts and of seeking a more cheerful climate like many migratory birds, whom he would do well to imitate. Judged by the thermometer, we find that the mean annual temperature of London is 50° Palm, and the same isothermal line passes through New York, though the climates of the two cities are from other reasons widely different. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich supplies us with a daily average temperature for the last fifty years, and by consulting this we find that on October 19 the average temperature falls below 50°, descending in January to 36°, and never regaining 50° again till May. Roughly speaking, those fleeing from cold must leave England not later than the middle of October, and should not return there till at least the end of May.</p>
         <p>Let us consider as fairly as possible the advantages and disadvantages of Cairo and the Nile for those in search of health.</p>
         <p>The advantages are: (1) A dry and exhilarating air which acts in itself as a tonic, and enables visitors to be out-of-doors in sunshine the whole day. (2) An almost complete absence of rain, and of fog, and of clouded leaden skies. (3) The absence of extreme cold, so that the invalid by closing his windows at sunset need never breathe air colder than 55° Fahr., even without any artificial heat. (4) The absence of strong winds at Cairo and Luxor, though invalids occasionally require special protection on the Nile. (5) The interest and relaxation of mind inspired in a country where the remains may be studied of the ancient Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Turks. (G) The presence in a perfectly oriental city of most available European luxuries, and alarge and hospitable English society. (7) The absence of moribund phthisical patients, who find Egypt too far from home. (8) The facilities for riding and driving, and for playing all outdoor games.</p>
         <p>The natives have a proverb, &quot;He who drinks the waters of the Nile invariably returns to Egypt ; &quot; and in many instances this has seemed to be true, for nearly all strangers develop in a few months a great fondness for Cairo, and are grieved to leave it ; while it can be honestly stated that most invalids either improve in health while in Egypt, or manfully hold their ground during their sojourn there.</p>
         <p>The objections to Egypt as a health-resort are: (1) Its distance of six days or more from England, and of at least three days from the south of Europe, so that a sea-voyage is unavoidable. (2) The expense which naturally attends such a journey, the cost of hotels and pensions in Cairo, and the extra cost of a journey up the Nile. (3) The mosquitoes, which welcome young women and children very irritatingly, until they get used to mosquito-nets. (4) A certain monotony at the dinner-table of buteher's meat,poultry, and game. (5) The insanitary condition of the picturesque old parts of Cairo.</p>
         <p>The climate of Egypt is, then, suitable during the winter months for a great variety of chronic ailments, among which may be 1neutioued-eow valeseence from pneumonia, fevers, and all acute diseases; that common delicacy of English youth which may be called &quot;threatened phthisis,&quot; all cases of early phthisis, and all quiescent cases of the late forms of the disease; chronic bronchitis and emphysema; bronchial, catarrhal, and spasmodic asthma; chronic catanhal affections of the larynx and pharynx, including &quot;clergyman's sore throat;&quot; rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout in its various forms; heart-disease, and all other complaints which prevent a patient from walking or other active exercise; anaemia and chlorosis; exhaustion of nervous system from too great excitement, worry, business, or study, and sleeplessness 01' hypoehoudria; neuralgia, hysteria and its accompanying dyspepsia; diseases of spinal cord, locomotor ataxy, ete.; chronic kidney-disease; and the very large class of people without organic disease, who shrivel up sadly in a cold climate, and expand joyously in a sunny atmo sphere where they are not perpetually reminded of their sensitiveness to cold and to 'Uaking cold.&quot; This last group includes those invalided home from India for malaria and other causes.</p>
         <p>Cases of all these ailments have passed satisfactorily under the 1vriier's observation during the last six winters.</p>
         <p>But the most important question to try and solve is what kind of patients ought not to be sent to E gypt.</p>
         <p>My personal opinion is that all cases of very advanced or rapidly advancing phthisis of both lungs would be better at or near home, unless the patients themselves express a decided preference for ending their days in a distant land. The friends of such patients often need to be reminded that mere change of climate will not cure the disease, but that wherever the sick man goes, he will undoubtedly take his disease with him.</p>
         <p>Again, patients with dropsy and all the troublesome sequelae of heart-disease are surely unwise to give up all their home-comforts and surroundings, unless their minds are wholly set upon going to a certain spot, and it seems cruel to prevent their carrying out the wish of their heart; but even then it is almost necessary that they should be accompanied by a trained nurse. A hot climate is perhaps too exciting for men with a tendency to apoplexy; but the sun at Cairo is not powerful till April, and then a helmet is sufficient protection.</p>
         <p>Former writers have said that phthisis with a tendency to haemorrhage should not be sent to Egypt; but I see no reason why they should not winter in Egypt, provided they exchange the undue stimulation of Cairo &quot;lrhamseens&quot; in April for the sea-breezes of Ramleh.</p>
         <p>Phthisical patients with a previous history of haemoptysis do not usually suffer from haemorrhage in Egypt, and, moreover, it is not a common symptom in the cases of phthisis which one sees among the negroes and other natives of the country.</p>
         <p>Outfit and , Clothing.--Let us take this opportunity of telling our countrymen, and especially our countrywomen, that it is no longer necessary to buy from the Outfitterthe travelling kit which is based on patterns at least forty years old. Dustcloaks, helmets, blue veils, goggles, pugries, and field-glasses are not becoming, and are not needful for walking or driving in Cairo. Let the visitor bring such clothing as he wears in England in the summer and autumn, and he will want little else beside. Flannel belts to be worn next to the skin are of great assistance in preventing attacks of diarrhea. Helmets for wearing up the Nile can be bought in Cairo. Pugries may be twisted around them, but it is of no use to wear streaming tails of coloured calico to protect the neck. If a helmet is objected to--and indeed few ladies look well in it--a Terai hat is the best substitute; but straw hats may be worn during the colder months. Flannel suits are always comfortable, and brown leather boots and shoes are commended to both sexes. Wire gauze goggles should be bought in England to protect delicate eyes from the glare of the sun and from sandstorms. Ladies who desire to ride must bring their habits, and will be more independent if they bring a saddle. Warm cloaks and rugs are wanted in December and January, and on the river always at night. Eeating's powder &quot; Persian powder is wanted for insects. Patent English or foreign medicines should be brought by the invalid if required, though the local druggists provide the public with the most commonly asked-for specialities. White umbrellas and all common requisites can be bought in Cairo.</p>
         <p>Ladies may be glad of the hint that silk or silk and wool combination garments are preferable to underlines</p>
         <p>Routes to J'Jyypt.-Those who are not afraid of the sea can leave London by P. and O. steamers, or British India &quot; Orient Line, and they will reach Ismailia in twelve days by paying £20.</p>
         <p>Robust people who are not dependent upon the presence of a doctor and stewardess can economize by travelling from Liverpool to Alexandria by the Moss or Papayanni lines. For those who are not martyrs to sea-sickness, and to the general discomfort of life on board ship, there is no doubt that the sea-voyage is very healthy, very restful, and useful in gradually aeeusiiomingr patients to change of climate.</p>
         <p>Visitors who desire as little of the sea as possible must make their way to Brindisi, and then on to Alexandria by P. and O. or Austrian Lloyd; or from Trieste to Alexandria by Austrian Lloyd; or from Genoa or Naples by Rubattino to Alexandria; or from Marseilles to Alexandria by the Messageries steamers.</p>
         <p>The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes three days and a half, and the whole journey from London to Cairo can be done any week in less than six days, at about the same expense as the long sea routes. Generally, is may be said, an English-speaking invalid is more comfortable on an English steamer, and it must be remembered that the large vessels which go on to India, China, and Australia, are often more luxurious than the smaller steamers which run only between Europe and Egypt. On the other hand, invalids must be warned that it is easier for them to land at Alexandria than at Ismailia, because they may be obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the early morning. Moreover, two trains run from Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-quarter hours, while from Ismailia to Cairo there is only one passenger train in the day, occupying four and three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any custom-house difficulty for personal baggage, and no passport is necessary.</p>
         <p>Proposed itinerary-Delicate patients should leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return to Cairo at the end of February. In April they should go to Bamleh, and thence perhaps to Italy and the south of France, arranging not to reach England or other cold climates till the very end of May.</p>
