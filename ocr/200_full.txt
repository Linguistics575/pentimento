THOUGH much has been written about Egypt of
late years, nothing especially for the guidance of
invalids has appeared in the form of a handbook
since 1867. The climate remains as it was then,
but many of the surroundings are changed and
improved, so that patients need no longer fear
absence of civilization or undue expense I have
tried to avoid writing a guide-book, and to supply
only that information which cannot be found in
them. Iyaedelrers's Guide-book is the best for Cairo
and the Delta, but unfortunately has not been
extended to Upper Egypt. Murtay's Handbook was
last published in 1888, but does not contain too
much recent information, and Messrs. Cook have

provided for their clients a very useful elementary

kind friends in Egypt and in England who have
supplied me with necessary information, and I
shall be grateful to those readers who will tell me
of any errors.

EGYPT AS A WINTER RESORT.

C H A P T E R I.
INTRODUCTION.

THIS handbook is a humble endeavour to answer
the queries of some of my esteemed medical friends
in England and in the United States, who tell me
they are sometimes at a loss to know What manner
of patients they ought and ought not to send to
Egypt. But, apart from the actual needs of
invalids and their professional advisers, there is
a large class of visitors who either accompany
delicate friends abroad, or flee from their own
homes merely to escape cold weather and bask in
the sunshine. It is obvious that a health-resort
which provides a suitable climate for invalids and
a sufficiency of interest and occupation for healthy
individuals will become more and more popular.
The national interest which England has taken in
Egypt since 1882, the growing prosperity and

civilization which have attended the efforts of her
officials on the spot, and the improved facilities
for travelling obtained by Messrs. Cook, have all
tended to make Cairo and the Nile a very favourite
winter resort. Some six thousand visitors come to
Cairo during the winter months, and of these about
twelve hundred proceed up the Nile in steamer or
in dahabiyeh. To show that the climate deals
fairly with these masses of visitors, it may be
mentioned that the writer, in a medical experience
of six winters, has lost only two patients who came
to Egypt for their health. Both these were
patients far advanced in consumption, who ought
never to have left their homes, one an Australian,
who reached Cairo u the beginning of 1888, and
died there in February; the other, an American,
who died in December, 1888, a few hours after
reaching Cairo. This experience is not only a.
personal one, for the death register shows that
there have been only nine deaths among British
visitors in Cairo during the sj} years ending June,
1880. Of these nine, seven arrived here ill of
incurable diseases; the eighth was thought to be
robust, but died of uraunic poisoning during her
first week in Cairo; and the ninth caught a. chill
while out sketching, and died of double pneumonia.
But the writer's object is not to try and prove
that Egypt is the best health-resort in the world,


Introduction. 3

but to give reasonable information about its climate
to those who have practically decided against the
respective merits of sea and mountain air, and
are in search of pure dry desert, air where min is
almost unknown, and where fog, strong winds, and
cold are never felt.

At the outset it must be remembered that where
the air is extremely dry, there the difference is the
greatest between the maximum and minimum
temperatures, for the sun's heat reaches the earth
Without difficulty by day, and again by night it
disappears into space. Patients, therefore, can bask
in Egypt in the temperature of an English summer
by daylight, but must be prepared for autumnal
cold after sunset. The summer months in England
under favourable circumstances are well suited to
those of feeble constitution, who can surround
themselves in their own homes with modern
luxuries, with the comforts which none but the
English thoroughly study, and with all the plea-
sures of friends and family. But when the autumn
cold requires such a one to take active outdoor
exercise, for which he is not suflieiently robust,
and when the absence of sunshine induces a de-
pression of spirits in addition to his physical
delicacy, he begins, if he is wise, to think of
deserting Isis home comforts and of seeking a.
more cheerful climate like many migratory birds,

whom he would do well to imitate. Judged by the
thermometer, we find that the mean annual tem-
perature of London is 50° Palm, and the same
isothermal line passes through New York, though
the climates of the two cities are from other
reasons widely different. The Royal Observatory
at Greenwich supplies us with {1, daily average tem-
perature for the last fifty years, and by consulting
this we find that on October 19 the average tem-
perature falls below 50°, descending in January
to MP, and never regaining 50° again till May.
Roughly speaking, those fleeing from cold must
leave England not later than the middle of October,
and should not return there till at least the end
of May.

Let us consider as fairly as possible the advan-
tages and disadvantages of Cairo and the Nile for
those in search of health.

The advantages are: (1) A dry and exhilarating
air which acts in itself as a tonic, and enables
visitors to be out-of-doors in_ sunshine the whole
day. (2) An almost complete absence of rain,
and of fog, and of clouded leaden skies. (3) The
absence of extreme cold, so that the invalid by
closing his windows at sunset need never breathe
air colder than 55° Fahr., even without any
adifieial heat. (4) The absence of strong winds
at Cairo and Luxor, though invalids occasionally


Introduction. 5

require special protection on the Nile. (5) The
interest and relaxation of mind inspired in a.
country where the remains may be studied of the
ancient Egyptians, Persiams, Greeks, Romans,
Arabs, and Turks. (G) The presence in a perfectly
oriental city of most available European luxuries,
and a, large and hospitable English society. (7)
The absence of moribund phthisieal patients, Who
find Egypt too far from home. (8) The facilities
for riding and driving, and for playing all outdoor
games.

The natives have a. proverb, "He who drinks
the waters of the Nile invariably returns to Egypt ; "
and in many instances this has seemed to be true,
for nearly all strangers develop in a few months
a great fondness for Cairo, and are grieved to
leave it ; while it can be honestly stated that most
invalids either improve in health while in Egypt,
or manfully hold their ground during their sojourn
there.

The objections to Egypt as a health-resort are:
(1) Its distance of sis days or more from England,
and of at least three days from the south of Europe,
so that a sea-voyage is unavoidable. (2) The ex-
pense which naturally attends such a journey, the
cost of hotels and pensions in Cairo, and the extra
cost of a. journey up the Nile. (3) The mosquitoes,
which welcome young women and children very

irritatingly, until they get used to mosquito-nets.
(4) A certain monotony at the dinner-table of
buteher's meat,poultry, and game. (5) The insani-
tary condition of the picturesque old parts of
Cairo.

The climate of Egypt is, then, suitable during
the winter months for a great variety of chronic
ailments, among which may be 1neutioued-eow
valeseence from pneumonia, fevers, and all acute
diseases; that common delicacy of English youth
which may be called "threatened pUhisis," all
cases of early phthisis, and all quiescent cases of
the late forms of the disease; chronic bronchitis
and emphysema; bronchial, catarrhal, and spas-
modic asthma; chronic catanhal affections of the
larynx and pharynx, including "clergyman's sore
throat;" rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, and
gout in its various forms; heart-disease, and all
other complaints which prevent a patient from
walking or other active exercise; anaemia and
chlorosis; exhaustion of nervous system from too
great excitement, worry, business, or study, and
sleeplessness 01' hypoehoudria; neuralgia, hysteria
and its accompanying dyspepsia; diseases of spinal
cord, locomotor ataxy, ete.; chronic kidney-dis-
ease; and the very large class of people without
organic disease, who sluivel up sadly in a cold
climate, and expand joyously in a sunny atmo-


Introduction. 7

sphere where they are not perpetually reminded
of their sensitiveness to cold and to 'Uaking cold."
This last group includes those iuvalided home from
India for malaria and other causes.

Cases of all these ailments have passed satis-
factorily under the 1vriier's observation during the
last six winters.

But the most important question to try and
solve is what kind of patients ought not to be sent
to E gypt.

My personal opinion is that all cases of very
advanced or rapidly advancing phthisis of both
lungs would be better at or near home, unless the
patients themselves express a decided preference
for ending their days in a distant land. The
friends of such patients often need to be reminded
that mere change of climate will not cure the
disease, but that wherever the sick man goes, he
will undoubtedly take his disease with him.

Again, patients with dropsy and all the trouble-
some sequelae of heart-disease are surely unwise
to give up all their home-comforts and surround-
ings, unless their minds are wholly set upon
going to a. certain spot, and it seems cruel to pre-
vent their carrying out the wish of their heart;
but even then it is almost necessary that they
should be accompanied by a trained nurse. A
hot climate is perhaps too exciting for men with

a tendency to apoplesy; but the sun at Cairo is
not powerful till April, and then a helmet is suffi-
cient protection.

Former writers have said that phthisis with a
tendency to hzemorrhage should not be sent to
Egypt; but I see no reason why they should not
winter in Egypt, provided they exchange the undue
stimulation of Cairo "lrhamseens" in April for
the sea-breezes of Ramleh.

Phthisical patients with a previous history of
haemoptysis do not usually suffer from haemorrhage
in Egypt, and, moreover, it is not a common
symptom in the eases of phthisis which one sees
among the ncgroes and other natives of the
country.

Oufjit and Clothinr--Let us bake this oppor-
tunity of telling our countrymen, and especially
our countrywomen, that it is no longer necessary
to buy from the Outfitter. the travelling kit which
is based on patterns at least forty years old. Dust-
cloaks, helmets, blue veils, goggles, pugries, and
field-glasses are not becoming, and are not needful
for walking or driving in Cairo. Let the visitor
bring such clothing as he wears in England in the
summer and autumn, and he will want little else
beside. Flannel belts to be worn next to the skin
are of great assistance in preventing attacks of
diarrhoea. Helmets for wearing up the Nile can


Introduction. 9

be bought in Cairo. Pugries may be twisted
around them, but it is of no use to wear streaming
tails of coloured calico to protect the neck. If a.
helmet is objected io--and indeed few ladies look
well in it-a 11erai hat is the best substitute; but
straw hats may be worn during the cohler months.
Flannel suits are always comfortable, and brown
leather boots and shoes are commended to both
sexes. Wire gauze goggles should be bought in
England to protect delicate eyes from the glare of
the sun and from saudstorms. Ladies who desire
to ride must bring their habits, and Will be more
independent if they bring a saddle. Warm cloaks
and rugs are wanted in December and January,
and on the river always at night. Eeating's
powder " Persian powder is wanted for insects.
Patent English or foreign medicines should be
brought by the invalid if required, though the local
druggists provide the public with the most com-
monly asked-for specialities. White umbrellas and
all common requisites wan be bought in Cairo.

Ladies may be glad of the hint that silk or silk
and wool combination garments are preferable to

Routes to J'Jyypt.-Those who are not afraid of
the sea can leave London by I'. and O. steamers,
or British India OI' Orient Line, and they will
reach Ismailia in twelve days by paying £20.


10 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Robust people who are not dependent upon the
presence of a doctor and stewardess can economize
by travelling from Liverpool to Alexandria by the
Moss or Papayanni lines. For those who are not
martyrs to sea-sickness, and to the general dis-
comfort of life on board ship, there is no doubt
that the sea-voyage is very healthy, very restful,
and useful in gradually aecustomi11g, patients to
change of climate.

Visitors who desire as little of the sea as possible
must make their way to Brindisi, and then on to
Alexandria by P. and O. or Austrian Lloyd; ot'
from Trieste to Alexandria by Austrian Lloyd; or
from Genoa or Naples by Eubattiuo to Alexandria;
or from Marseilles to Alexandria by the Messagerios
steamers.

The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes
three days and a half, and the whole journey from
London to Cairo can be done any week in less
than six days, at about the same expense as the
long sea routes. Generally, is may be said, an
English-speaking invalid is more comfortable on
an English steamer, and it mash be remembered
that the large vessels which go on to India, China,
and Australia, are often more luxurious than the
smaller steamers which run only between Europe
and Egypt. On the other hand, invalids must be
warned that it is easier for them to land at


Introduction. 11

Alexandria than at Ismailia, because they may be
obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and
then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the
early morning. Moreover, two trains run from
Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-opo'arter
hours, while from Ismailia to Cairo there is only
one passenger train in the day, occupying four and
three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any
custom-house diff1eulty for personal baggage, and
no passport is necessary.

Proposed itinerary-Delicate patients should
leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so
as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some
remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the
Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return
to Cairo at the end of February. In April they
should go to Bamleh, and thence perhaps to Italy
and the south of France, arranging not to reach
England or other cold climates till the very end of
May.

PORT Sam.

THE Visitor is not recommended to stay in any of
the three towns on the Suez Canal, but he must
pass through one of them unless he arrives from
Europe by way of Alexandria. Port Said, with a.
population of about 10,500 natives and 6000
Europeans, is an impromptu insanitary town
which originated in 1859 with the huts of the
Canal workmen. It stands on a, narrow strip of
sand two hundred to three hundred yards wide,
between Lake Meuzaleh and the sea, its site
having been formed by dredgings from the harbour
thrown into the shallow lake. The surface of the
town is perfectly flat, and only about four feet
above the sea-level, and the sandy soil is permeated
by uneemcnted eesspools and underground reser-
voirs used by some of the inhabitants. It is
dependent on Cairo for a water-supply aid Ismailia.


Suez Canal. 13

It ought, of course, to be connected with Cairo by
the railway, but this is strenuously objected to by
those interested in the welfare of Alexandria.
Visitors must either go half through the Canal
and disembark at Ismailia, or alight from their
steamer at Port Said into a small postal boat,
which will carry them and their luggage to
Ismailia in time to catch the train for Cairo.
Port Said has a very small English colony, but
possesses two English doctors, one in charge
of the native hospital, the other living at the
English hospital founded by Lady Strangford.
The three hotels are not first class, but the
traveller must often be dependent on one of them
in making the journey from Cairo to the Holy
Land. Meteorological observations are made at
Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez by the Canal
Company for transmission to Paris, but, as none
of the towns can be considered a health-resort, it
is unnecessary to quote them here.

ISMAILIA.

There is no prettier spot in Egypt than this
little wayside town of 3500 inhabitants, most of
whom are French and natives, and connected with
the Canal Company and its works. There are two
hotels, sometimes quite empty, and at other times,

during the winter season, crowded to overflowing
with hungry tourists. There are no places of
interest to visit, and little to do besides sea-bathing
in Lake Timsah, and donkey-riding along famous
broad roads lined with ssve0b-sm0lliag trees.

A fresh-water canal runs from Cairo to supply
the waterworks, and the consequent mixture of
fresh and salt water since 1869 is thought by the
inhabitants to be responsible for the malarial fever
for Which Ismailia has of late years become
unpleasantly noted in a country where malarial
diseases are very rare.

There is a French hospital beautifully situated
outside the town, and a French and a Greek
doctor. The monuments now in the square at
Ismailia, cut in Syene granite and diorite from
Assouan, were brought from the ruins of Pithom,
about twelve miles west of Ismailia. Pithom was
apparently one of the garrison towns built by the
Israelites for Rameses II. in the land of Goshen,
and near it they encamped upoll the second night
of the Exodus, just as Lord Wolseley did in 1882
in the same district, now called Kassassin. The
third night the fleeing Israelites halted close to
Ismailia, and on the filth day of their flight they
are believed to have crossed the see about half-
way between Ismailia and Suez.

Ismailia is one of the cleanest and dullest towns

in Egypt, and was one of the healthiest until the
boon of fresh Water in great quantities after 1876
proved a. curse by causing small swamps of water,
which pereolated through the desert sand from the
new canals. The water-tauks in the gardens
Which used to supply the houses, and oeeasionally
overflow, have been exchanged for a, system of
pipes and taps. Eucalyptus trees also have been
planted, with a decided diminution of malaria.

SUEZ.

Suez is a, town of 11,000 people, rather
more English than either Port Said 01' Ismailia,
and is of e0111's0 the port of entry from India,
Australia, and the far East. There is a. comfort-
able hotel, an English doctor, and a railway line
to Ismailia and Cairo, and a fresh-water canal
supplying it from the Nile. Excursions may be
made to the oasis called Moses' Well, to Ataka
mountain, to the sea-eoast to collect shells, or to
Suakin.

Suez is in the same latitude as Cairo, and the
Atalra range stretches across the desert to join
Mokattam there.

Naturalists tell us that at Suez begins a, genuine
tropical sen, differing entirely in its inhabitants
from the Mediterranean, only one day's journey

north of it. Hermit crabs and very many others
of the erab family, bivalves and univalves, star-
shaped egg-urchins (Eehiuometra lucunter), crus-
taceans, sponges, and ooral-hsh, with many scores
of others, can be found by exploring the coast and
rocky pools.

By means of a boat on a clear day, a visit to the
coral reefs may be made, though the best coral is
at some distance from Suez. Dark brown and
yellowish green coral in loose and brittle bits is
based here on massive rocks of black mesh coral
(Porites), and more rarely there may be found the
cherry-red cup-star variety (Pocillopora)-not to
be confounded with the ordinary red coral, which
is not found here.

The strange and wonderful fishes can be best
seen by going to the market, no less than five
hundred and twenty kinds which haunt the coral
slopes being known. One often offered for sale is
the ball-fish (Tetredon), which has the power of
blowing itself up like a, balloon and floating on
the water on its back; this, like the ui'ehin-fish
(Diodon), is protected like a hedgehog on land by
spiny prielrles, beside a beak something like a
parrot's. They can bite well with their beaks, but
are not poisonous. Small sharks are occasionally
heard of, leaping and flying-fish, and the gay parrot
and rainbow fishes are also known.


CHAPTER m.
CAIRO.

THE capital of Egypt and seat of government is
sis days by post from London, 211. 5" 9" east of
Greenwich, and in north latitude 30° 4’ 40".
Geoloy1-Every one knows that the Delia, is an
alh1vialplain,literally the gift of the Nile, and that
Cairo, succeeding to old Memphis, is at the apex of
the Delta. The Mokattnm hill of limestone rises
about sis hundred feet (above sea-level) behind the
present town, and, as its fossils and nummulites
show (Echinolaznpas Cramcri, etc.), its ageis that of
the Eocene Tertiary, and its sides were washed by
the Mediterranean waters in the days before the
Delta was formed into a shallow bay With a sandy
bottom. Near Mokuttam is the Bed Hill, 320
feet above the sea, of Miocene or Oligocene period,
with sinter conglomerate containing silieifled trees,
probably deposited within the area of an inland
lake. At Mohattnm, towards the Red Hill, are
purple and yellow sand and fine gravel, with a
c

little marl and clay and fragments of Terebratula,
Ostrea, Peetea, and Balanus, all considerably later
than the Eocene period, and tending to show that
there was once another sea margin 220 feet above
the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Near the
Pyramids again are raised beaches, limestone
pierced by Pholacles and Ostrea mztlulata ; and two
miles south of the Sphinx are fossil sen-urchins
(Clypeaster Egyptiacus), oyster-shells and pectens
(? Post-Pliocene). The geological map shows
alluvial deposit everywhere in the Delta and along
the banks of the Nile, while to both east and west
of this near Cairo is nummulite limestone, and to
the north-east of Cairo are sandhills in the desert
stretching down to the Suez Canal. The incom-
parably dry pure air of Cairo and Upper Egypt
is clue to this same nummulite limestone desert,
Which for miles and miles acts as a great lung of
nature and purifies all the air which blows across
it, while the extraordinary fertility of Lower Egypt
is caused by the alluvial deposit. The absence
of vegetation and of moistufé’ in the desert has
left its characters almost unaltered for ages, though
there is abundant evidence of mountain torrents
in prehistoric times and in the present day.

Lower Egypt consists geologically, therefore, of-
(1) Nummulite limestone of the Eocene period,
stretching southwards in the desert from Cairo

and Suez, on the east of the Nile valley, and again
on its west beyond the Pyramids; (2) a little
calcareous sandstone (Miocene) containing trunks
of petrified trees; (3) raised beaches of a more
recent time, {made of gravel, sand, and seashells,
near Cairo and Suez ; (4) alluvial deposits forming
the Nile valley and Delta; and (5) recent sandhills
marking the old centre of the bay of Lower Egypt,
in the days when the Mediterranean washed the
Mokattam heights and the terrace on which the
Pyramids now stand.

Near Cairo there are in the desert numerous
dry river-beds, telling of the time when there was
an abundant rainfall, and the wild elephant, which
has now retreated south of the Soudan, could take
his fill of water and green food. The existence of
ravines and rounded pebbles must not be taken as
evidence of a great rainfall in prehistoric times,
for even to-day, although there is so little rain in
Cairo, there are sometimes in the hills above Cairo
very heavy torrential storms, which, although the
quantity of rain is not great, sweep down the
valleys and actually cover the neighbouring fields
with a yellow mud and with small pebbles.

Enough has been written to show that the
alluvial soil deposited by the Nile is an entirely
foreign element in the geological formation of
Egypt, and it may be easily studied in the per-

pendieular sepia-coloured mud-banks, Which vary
slightly in colour, and have occasional thin layers
of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no
alluvium, which is of course the only soil in
Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm
of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile
soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world
in composition.

The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal
Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several
boriugs through this soil to the old floor of the Delta.
The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium
were found to continue down to the depth of
121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level
of the Mediterranean. At that depth a remark-
able change in the deposits took place, and beds
of gravel containing both pebbles and suhangular
fragments of quartzite, chert, compact limestone,
With some metamorphic and igneous rocks, were
found, and similar beds occurred at intervals down
to the greatest depth reached. Up to the present
time no contemporaneous organic remains have
been found in these deposits. The borings near
the Nile at Cairo in 1883 may be briefly sum-
marized thus: For 6 ft. beneath the surface, dry
mould; from 7 ft. to 16 ft., dry sandy mould; from
17 ft. to 38 ft., wet sand; and from 39 ft. to 45 ft.,
wet coarse sand.


Cairo. 21

The subsoil of Cairo is washed every year by the
Nile, which brings to it in the summer the rain
from the mountains of Abyssinia. In June the
river at Cairo is at its lowest; then slowly begins
to rise throughout J uly, and reaches its maximum
flood in the first ten days of September, remaining
high during September; and in October attains an
artificial height, in consequence of the irrigation
basins in Upper Egypt then allowing the water
to escape and swirl on to complete the flood irrig -
tion. During October the water gradually recedes
from the basins, and is carried all over Lower
Egypt by an elaborate system of canals, so that
the early months of the year become gradually
drier and drier, until the period of low Nile is
again reached in May.

In the ordinary flood-tune, there is considerable
infiltration beneath the river-banks, besides the
desired inundation for the future crops, so that
the subsoil water rises in Cairo to a. height of only
5 ft. from the ground surface, and at low Nile it
sinks again to about 19 l below the surface. We
may take it that during the Winter season the
subsoil water is more than 10 ft. from the ground.

Now, although subsoil drainage in England
would seem to have resulted in an increase in the
health of the population, and an especial diminu.
tion of phthisis and enteric fever, there is one


22 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

practical good from this annual washing of the
subsoil Which must not be overlooked. For many
years the resident population has allowed its filth
to percolate into the porous soil and drain away as
it pleased till it joined the level of subsoil water,
and it is easy to conceive that if this earth were
not periodically cleansed and oxygenated by the
Nile infilirsdion, it would have long ceased to have
any benefieial properties as a sponge. This cleans-
ing process, 1il1iel1 takes place in September and
October, has, of course, the disadvantageous effect
of altering the level, not only of the infiltrated soil
water, but of the contents of all the uncemented
cesspools of former and more insanitary days.

It must be borne in mind that the subsoil water
has a slope of its own equal to that of the Delta,
viz. 1 in 10,000, and, instead of remaining local, is
constantly flowing, northwards towards the sea.
This is easily proved by experiments in this Delia
or in India.

Sun, moon, and stroz.--lm average of eleven
years taken from the Greenwich l’eeetds tells us
that there are in England only 1211 hours of bright
sunshine during the twelve months, or less than
two hours a day in the winter. It is unnecessary
to take a similar observation at Cairo, but Table I.
shows that we do have clouds during the cold
months, in spite of an apparently perpetual sun-

shine. The sun is never too hot till the end of
February for ladies, and men seldom require
helmets till May. Indeed, Bo1l10 English offieers
have so little fear of the sun, that they wear all
the year round no protection for their heads but
the small red "fez." The maximum temperature .
in the sun at Cairo varies from 156° to 161° Fuhr.
in the summer. Twilight is, of course, almost
absent from Cairo; but, on the other hand, in
December, when the first chilly and cloudy days
appear, the daylight is of three hours' longer dura,
tion than in England. The longest days are only
fourteen hours with us, while the shortest are ten
hours.

In nearly every village in Egypt there is a dance
to the moon every month, dating from the days of
Arab pagan moon-worship, but now incorporated
into a dervish rite of the Mohammedan religion.

The moonlit nights at Cairo are very beautiful,
and drives, rides, and dinner-parties at the
Pyramids and elsewhere are very popular among
the Europeans. The stillness and beauty of the
desert at full moon are not easily forgotten.
Owing to the olearness of the atmosphere, the
moon has the appearance of being distinctly larger
and nearer than in Europe; and the Gas Com-
pany of Cairo avails itself of 'a special clause in
its contract, to the effect that at the time of full

moon on1rfot1r-Mhs of the street-lamps need be
lighted. When there is 110 moon, the star-spangled
sky is a real treat, for the cloudy nights are few
and far between, and the flat roofs of the houses
easily lend themselves to the studies of amateur
astronomers. Among the stars which can be seen
in Cairo, but not in the latitudes of London,
Boston, or Philadelphia, are Canopus and Horolo-
gium at the beginning of the year; while the
Southern Cross shows about two-thirds of its
height in May and June, though the foot of the
cross cannot be seen till one goes south of As-
souan. Ara and the Centaur are well seen in
July, and the wl1ols of the Scorpion shows to per-
fection; also at the close of the year we have the
Crane and the Phoenix. The Milky Way is always
beautiful, and the study of the stars has a, special
attraction in a country where one can become
familiar with the original Arabic names still used
by all those who have acquired the knowledge of
the named stars.

It may be remembered that the march on TeI-el-
Kebir, in 1882, before dawn, was steered by the
stars, the English brigadiers being ordered to
march on Arcturus.

26 Egypt us a TVinter Resort.

Table I. is a resumé \which I have made from the
records of the five years 1884-88, the monthly
bulletins being printed by the Ehedivial Observa-
tory in the Abhassiyeh suburb of Cairo.

The observations are taken throughout the day
and night-at 6 a.m., 9 am, noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.,
o 1).m., and midnight. The barometer used is a
Fortin, verified and compared u Montsouris Ob.
servatory in Paris. The readings are reduced to
freezing-point, and are taken u a level of 108'2
feet above the sea. My table shows that the
variations are not very great, and its practical
value is very little, though, as it falls when the
wind changes to the south, and rises again when
the prevailing north wind blows, it is useful to
cheek the probable duration of a khamseen. The
greatest variation during 1888 was 30S inches on
one day in March, and 2T4 in. once in February.
The temperatures are taken by a Centigrade ther-
mometer, verified every year, and placed on a
balcony thii‘ty-two feet from the ground, facing
north, and sheltered from the sun. The extremes
of temperature are read daily from self-registering
maximum and minimum instruments. The mini-
mam result is generally found about 6 a.m. or a
little earlier, and the daily maximum is invariably
about 2 p.m. 01' 3 p.m.

During 1888, the absolute maximum reached


Cairo. 27

was 111'8° on July 13, while on the night of
January 20, the absolute minimum of 364" was
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was
110° on June 9, and the lowest minimum
was 35"Y in January. Freezing-point seems
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the
desert, may be found occasionally With a thin
coating of ice. I may say here, for the informa.
tion of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of
rooms on the north side of the house, kept pro-
perly shut during the hot hours, need never during
the year' exceed 8Y Fahr.; and, on the other
hand, that the same rooms, during the depths of
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm
outer air during the day, need never have a. tem-
perature below 52° Fahr., without employing a
fire, By living in sunny south rooms, or by em-
ploying ariifieial heat, the invalid can be certain
all night in the winter of a temperature of GW'
Falw., or more.

My observations, therefore, correspond with the
results obtained by the Rev, Dr. Barnett in Cairo,
Which I give in Table II. For nearly two years
he took observations six times daily, from 6 mm.
to f) p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of
an ordinary house.


28 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

His thermometers were hung between the Win‘
dows in an inner room, on the second floor, with
rooms above and all round, except on the east
side, where there were two windows, on which the
sun shone very little during the foreman. The
doors and windows were open in the night, but
all closed at 9 a.m.

The percentage of the humidity of tlifair is cal-
culated by the usual tables from the readings of
wet- and dry-bulb thermometers. The absolute
humidity is the vapourdension contained in the
air, counted in inches of a column of mercury at
freezing-point. The humidity of 58'4 may be
compared with the mean annual humidity at


Cairo. 29

Greenwich, which is 87, or with 70'7, which is the
record for Algiers in the year 1884.

But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally low-to an absolute minimum
of 4 on March 24, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.

Esapomtioe.---The quantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by
means of a. vessel containing water protected by
course svire.gauze, and placed in the shade, but so
that air can pass freely over it. The difference
between the level of the water at any two observa-
tions gives the depth of water Which has empo-
mted. The following are the numbers in inches
for 1888, which was an average dry year ;-Janw.
ary, '.Y8; February, '.Y8; March, T8; April, 7;
May, S'1; June, 11; July, 15'5; August, Iiy3;
September, fr5; October, 7; November, 5; De-
cember, 4s1-total, 93'7 inches. For practical
irrigation the evaporation in the basins is reckoned
at 7 inches in month all through the year.

fhiin./hll.--Nisitors sometimes come to Cairo
believing that it never rains there, which is, how-
ever, almost true of Luxor. Table I. shows clearly
that showers of rain are liable to fall during eight


30 Egypt " a Winter Resort.

months of the year, though the total amount of
the year is little more than one inch. This is
always surprising to those who are accustomed to
the averages of London, 2457; Hyeres, 28; Bourne-
mouth, 28'9; Nice, 3P0; Algiers, 32; Torquay,
39‘6; Pau, 43; Montreux, 50. At Cannes and
Mentone, from November to April alone, the rain-
fall averages 32 and 178 inches respectively.
The absence of rain and umbrellas does not neees-
sarily make a country suitable for invalids, but it
enables them to count with certainty upon the
morrow being a fine day, and removes at least one
element of risk and depression. Surface-drains
for storm-water are not necessary in Cairo; the
streets are watered by carts every day to prevent
dust, and the trees often look as if it would be a
charity to wash their leaves.

Dew.-) small amount of dew is always present
in Cairo and the desert on account of the great
difference in temperature between that of the day
and night. (M. Barbey found ninety-three grammes
on a square metre of maelrintosh'at Ismailia in
March, 1880.)

The temperature of the Nile water is a little
higher in the early morning than the temperature
of the air, and therefore a line of mist can be
sometimes seen early in the day during December
and January, which accurately marks out the line


Cairo. 31

of the river. The annual regularity of the rise
and fall of temperature, of the barometer and of
humidity, of the wind, of sunshine, and of the Nile
flood are elements which materially combine to
ensure the comfort of the invalid visitor. It is
easy for any intelligent resident to be “weather
wise,"and to prophesy for his friends the condition
of the immediate future.

During 1887 there were showers of rain on fifteen
days. Thunder and lightning occur about once a,
year, and hail is rather less common, while snow
is unknown. The May rainfall in my table is
exceptionally high in consequence of an abnormal
storm in 1887.

The state of the sky is judged by figures running
from O to 10, and shows an excellent average. The
clouds are brought up from the sea. by the north
wind, or the sky becomes overcast during, a south
wind from the infinitesimal particles of sand which
seem to be held in suspension in the air.

Jrind.-The prevailing wind both in Cairo and
Alexandria is always from the north, though it
may be noticed that a cool dry wind blows from
the desert during J auuary. Also one sees au the
force of the wind, which is calculated by means of
an anemometer, and shows the number of miles
per hour, is abated during the winter months, and
only becomes freshened when the summer has set


82 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

in. Two miles per hour is usually reckoned "ealm,"
five miles is considered "light air," ten miles "ligld
breeze," and 414, which was the maximum wind-
velocity during 1888, is called " moderate gale."
The khamseen wind is the only bad one in
Egypt. It is so called, not because it lasts for
fifty days, but because it is liable to occur during
the fifty days which follow Easter Monday, and
possibly has some connection with the equiuoetial
gales elsewhere. It blows from the south or south-
south-east, the more easterly variety being the
most disagreeable. It usually continues three days,
but may in rare cases last as many as seven days.
The number of khamseen days in any one year
would seem to vary from four to twenty. We wake
in the morning to find a great calm, clouded sky,
grey atmosphere, and an invisibly fine sand sus-
pended in the air, which seems to have been
caught up from the desert and to be held there
until the wind veers again to the north at sunset
on the third day, and the air becomes once more
clear, cool, and even cold. On at ieally bad
day the ssan's rays are wholly obscured, and the
atmosphere becomes intensely dry, and approaches
the colour of a London yellow fog. It finishes with
a eor1fliet of the winds overhead until the north
gains the day, and with the fall sometimes of a
few drops of rain ; after this a refreshing north


Cairo. 33

breeze blows again for a week or ten days, and
then the khamseen may again appear.

Russegger is quoted as having proved that a
quantity of free electricity is found in the air
during a klvamsusen, at first negative, afterwards
positive, and then rapidly changing from one to the
other. This question is worthy of study, for no
intelligent man can undergo the odd experience of
this wind without being certain that some unusual
electrical disturbance is taking place.

The consideration of the effect of this disturbance
upon invalids is very important, and it may at
once he said that they do not seem to suffer more
than the rest of the Europeans, and even in many
cases suffer less, because, unlike their more robust
associates, they are not suddenly deban'ed by the
rapid rise of thermometer from taking active exer-
eise. The fall of temperature at the end of three
days' dry heat is apt to be more dangerous to
imprudent people than the heat itself, for in March
there may be upon these days a fall of 30° 1Jahr.
at sunset. The general effects of the khamseen
are a little excitement and stimulation of the
system, a more rapid succession of ideas and
increased action of some of the functions, followed
by listlessness, headache, and languor. Some
warmth-loving Europeans actually luxuriate in a
mild khamseen; but all others are seriously incon-

D

venienced by not being able to pursue their ordi-
nary outdoor life, and those whose work does not
permit of their resting feel fagged and tired before
the close of the day. The effect on natives would
seem to be something similar, the street-occupants
lying about in all positions on the paths, instead
of sitting and chattering as on other days. Fever
patients in bed do not seem to be conscious of the
change to khamseen weather. Bronehitie and
phthisical individuals are rather benefited than
otherwise by the dry, warm air ; but it is doubtful
whether the air would not be too stimulating for
those with a tendency to haunopbysis.

My only experience 011 this point is derived from
one young Englishwoman, whose expectoration in
March became a little bloody. She liked the
khamseen days; but I thought it prudent to send
her to Ramleh, ehieily because she had a very bad
family history of haemoptysis. A bad khamseen,
besides its effects on the human race, shrivels up
roses and other flowers, and will even warp and
crack unseasoued wood. It is curious that the
same southerly wind, so hot in March and April,
is occasionally in winter the coldest that blows,
the difference being that then the sun's rays
fall more obl1huely on the desert, and the wind
is chilled by its passage over the mountains of
Abyssinia.


Cairo. 35

After April the Cairo temperature is always
above 7(Y' Fahr., and invalids are glad to hurry
away through the gates of Europe, which are no
longer closed against them. Rheumatism and lung
cases which are in need of tt sun-bathing" can
and do stay till May and June, and the few
phtl1isieal patients who have remained in Egypt
all the year round have not regretted it so far
as we know. It is only natural that Europeans
should wish to leave Egypt for their own homes
directly the heat becomes markedly felt; but every
spring we have the same experience of patients
writing back to us of the cheerlessness and cold
in some spot less favoured than sunny, rainless
JJairo.

Has the climate of Cairo changed during recent
years or not ? Modern visitors are always told by
travellers of an earlier generation that the climate
has woefully depreciated, and has lost its charm of
dryness because of the improvements in irrigation,
and of the trees and gardens which have sprung
into being since 1850.

Let us examine the few broken records of the
climate that we possess and compare them with
Table I. But before we make this modern com-
parison, let us remember that we have no grounds
for supposing that during historic times has there
been any appreciable change in the rainfall, the

river-flow, or the Band-blow of the country. There
is said to be only one evidence on the monuments
of rain having been known in Lower Egypt, and
we see around us io-day the mud-brick tombs
covered with stucco, dating from the Third or Fourth
Dynasty (3.0. 3800), when they were built without
any apparent fear of their dissolution.

This shows no perceptible difference; but the.
annual rainfall for 1835-39 (Destrouches) is said
to have averaged less than half an inch, and if so,
we now have almost three times more min than
formerly.

The following table shows a comparison of
mean temperatures at Cairo, taken at intervals
during the last hundred and twenty-eight years,
but not always at similar hours, Which probably
accounts for the variation shown in column 4.
The net result shows no decided change in the
regularity of Cairo temperature.

[I From my Table L

For the sake of those who do not want to be
troubled with tables of figures, I have made a
practical analysis of the several months at Cairo,
and to this have added the arrivals of migratory
birds for the sportsman, and the approximate
dates when ripe fruit and flowers first appear in
the gardens. Much, of course, might be written
on the agricultural produce of a. medium country
which assimilates barley from the north and
bananas from the south in the same way as it
embraces individuals from all parts of the world.

Octoberv--llesident European families return to


38 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Cairo after the middle of the month, because the
summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and
winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the
proportion of heat to dampness is still great,
mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not
advised to arrive till the last days, of the month
at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper
Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.
Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and eustard-
apples. Bananas have begun, and continue all the
winter. Among flowers there are dahlia, Zinnia,
Periwinkle, and tuberoses.

Novemben-A beautiful month for invalids to
arrive, and before the crush of pleasure-seekers,
so that good rooms can be easily secured. The
Nile inundation is still out between the town and
the Pyramids, and the sunsets are perhaps more
beautiful than at any other time of year. Weather
no longer too hot for outdoor exercise. Mosquitoes
disappearing, though nets are always wanted at
night throughout the year, and Jair-slcinned
strangers suffer until they become aeelimUized.
Oranges and lemons. Chrysanthemums and lovely
pointsettia shrubs.

Decembor.--At the end of the month we are
liable to a little cloud and rain, and invalids who
want to avoid all cold damp should go up to Luxor.
Temperature like a dry September in England.


Cairo. 39

Starlings arrive. Oranges and lemons again, as in
all the winter months. Balsam and heliotrope.
Jttnutrry.--There is often a cold south wind from
the desert, and though the days are not really cold,
the evenings require a fire indoors and fan over-
coat abroad. Lung invalids ought not to be out
after sunset. Temperature like the last week of
September in England. Quail return to Upper
Egypt from the Sondan. Roses bloom all the
year round in Cairo, but they are now at their
best. Hyacinth, camellia, mignonette, ranune11lus,
eyelamen, verbena, gypsophila, and orangc-flowers.
Febrmary.-TtmsperUuve like a dry English
September, chilly at the' beginning of the month,
but warm and pleasant at the end, so that fires
and overcoats are hardlywanted at night. Inmlids
return from Luxor to Cairo at the end of February
to escape the south winds, which begin earlier
there. Quail breed in Upper Egypt, and appear
again in Lower Egypt; starlings take their flight.
Oranges, lemons, and loquats. Violets, petunias,
phlox, bougainvillia, and roses.
Jlarrlt.-TernperMure is a little like London in
July, but the great feature of this month is the
south wind, which is almost certain to blow at least
twice for two or three days at a time. It is at first
welcomed as a pleasant change after the cold
weather, but soon becomes disagreeable. The last

week of the month is often hot, but previous to
that, during a south wind, the shade temperature
at 120011 is about 80°; indoors it is 64"; the baro-
meter falls from 30 to 207, and there are IO''
difference between the wet and dry bulbs. Tourists
tire of Egypt at the first hot wind, and make for
Palestine, Constantinople, etc. Snipe, ducks, and
geese leave for Europe; excellent quail, spur-winged
plover, and dove shooting. Dianthus, pansy,
China aster, marguerites, delphinium, fuchsia,
gladiolus, lobelia, sweet pea, and wall-flowers.
Acacia. trees in the boulevards shed their leaves
and remain bare for about a month.

April.~The days are warm like the hottest days
in an English summer, but are not felt so oppres-
sive because of the dryness of the air. The houses
and habits of the country are also specially adapted
for the hot weather. Rooms are now occupied
which face towards the north and catch the eool
wind, and on hot days it is wisest not to go out
immediately after luncheon. Europeap,louses
and hotels are built so that the rooms are sixteen
feet high, thus providing for plenty of cubic space
when the windows are obliged to be closed to keep
out the heat and the flies and mosquitoes, which
now begin to be troublesome. The khamseen wind
occurs at intervals of about ten days, and great
care ought to be taken not to relinquish all winter


Cairo. 41

clothing, though the temperature is often above
OO'' Fahr. for a few hours at a, time. Invalids
leave for Ramleh, or for Italy and the south of
France. Strawberries and apricots. Oleander,
pelargonium, and Sunflowers.

JIay.--We are still liable to occasional khanr.
seen winds, and each week the weather is becoming
warmer; but Cairo is now vorylovely; the trees in
the streets have their new foliage, and the gardens
are bright with many subtropical fiosrering trees
and shrubs. On May 6 I once saw the exceptional
event of a thunder and lightning storm, with hail-
stones as big as dried peas, and a shade tempera-
ture of 85° Fahr. Quail leave Egypt for Europe.
Sweet melons and water-melons. Balsam, mag-
nolia, lotus, jessamine, eonvolvulus, and passion-
flowers.

June, July, Auyust.-lhese are the three hottest
months of the year, and in August the climate is
already becoming a little damp in consequence of
the rising Nile. Rich natives spend these months
in Alexandria, Syria, 01' Constantinople. Euro-
peans in Cairo take a siesta after luncheon.
Government ofEees are closed at 1p.m.,but after
4pm1. every Englishman goes out to ride, drive,
golf, or lairrrtennis, and the British soldier plays
cricket anti football. The nights are always cool,
so that it is possible to dine out of doors without

insects, and afterwards to sleep well. The families
of European offieials usually leave for Europe at
the beginning of June, but some ladies only leave
Egypt every other summer. Sand-grouse and bee
Jiyes (fig-eaters). Grapes, almonds, peaches, figs,
and melons in June; and in August, in addition,
there are mangoes, dates, and custard-apples.
Dahlias, zinnias, Periwinkle, tuberoses, and the
perennial hibiscus.

Septembsnv-This is a hot, damp month, the most
trying of the year. The temperature is decidedly
lower than in the three preceding months, and
there is no rain; but the Nile flood and inundation
produce a state of dampness Which, together With
the comparative heat, is trying for Europeans.
Judged by the thermometer alone, the month is
not unlike May in Cairo, but the raising of the
humidity from 48 to 62 per cent. makes all the
difference. Grey quail reach Egypt. Cotton-pick-
ing begins. Prickly pears, bananas, and summer
fruits and flowers.

CHAPTER W.
cA1Pvo-(contirwed) .

Public health in Caivo.-There has been no census
since 1882, and it is doubtful whether the statistics
then gathered are sui%iently accurate. There are
believed to be about 375,000 inhabitants, of whom
21,650 me not Turkish subjects, and are mostly
Europeans, The deaths among Europeans during
the last seven years, including the cholera year,
have averaged 473, " 21'8 per 1000 per annum,
which compares favourably with {my town in
Europe 01' America. But the figures ought prob-
ably to be higher, as it is diffieult to conceive that
the lowest classes of Maltese, Jews, Greeks, and
Lovantines, who are all included among the
foreigners, must not considerably deteriorate the
mortality rate. The death-mte among the natives
is shockingly high, 405 per 1000, and this is prin-
cipally due to the mortality (800 a month) of
infants under one year of age during the four


44 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

hottest months of the year," diarrhoea being the
most common oertified cause of death. Those
11naeauaiuted with the lowest class of Egyptians
can form no idea of the filth in which they volun-
tarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,
and of their indifference to medical aid until the
child is actually dead. The apathy of the people
on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extra-
ordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The
average bii'th-mte in Cairo during the last six
years is 518, and that of Alexandria is 485 per
1000. During 1887 the highest birth-mte recorded
per 1000 among ninety-five other towns publishing
vital statistics were-Dusseldorf, 39'1; Buenos
Ayres, 39'7; Chemnitz, 44.8 '. while the figures for
Egyptian towns were-Sues and Ismailia, 54'2;
Cairo, 55'4; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,
73'7. It is melancholy to 1vfleet that one-third
of the native children die before they have lived
twelve months, and more than one-half of them
die before they have reached the age of five years
It is doubtful whether this extraordinary fecundity
extends itself to European residents in Egypt,
whose habits and laws of divorce are, of course,
entirely different. During my own residence in
Cairo, I have known tl1irty-five English brides
(at 20-35) who have been imported into Egypt ; of
these twenty-seven have borne one or more chil-

dren, one died shortly after marriage, and the
remaining seven {LI'O as yet childless.

It will be interesting to note what diseases
visitors to Egypt are liluoly to suffer from during
their stay.

First and most frequent comes Diarrhea, which
seems to be invariably produced by a chill, such
as cold after a sunny day, and possibly by neglect-
ing to wear a flannel belt round the waist by day
or night, which seems to be it good preventive.
The individual seems to be attacked, as he might
be in Europe, by :L ct cold in the head "-is probably
fatigued by exertion at the time, and eats an
ordinary meal afterwards. In the early morning
he is awakened by mild diarrhoea, which continues
two or three days, and readily yields to rest, milk
diet, gentle aperients, and bismuth. Loss mild
cases occur in delicate women, which seem to be
due to congestion of the iutestine---aro associated
with mild fever for three days, and are cured in
about a, week. I have never been able to trace
any ease to the drinking-water, and it occurs
among those who filter, boil, and filter again their
water. Some strong robust men laugh at flannel
belts and never wear them, but to weaker vessels
they are a great comfort and useful preventive of
catarrh.

Dysentery I have only seen three times in sis


46 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

years among visitors, and three times among
resident Europeans who had previously suffered
from the disease in other countries. All were
mild cases, and yielded readily to saline aperients
and astringents, 01' ipeeaeuanlla,

Of more than twenty cases of Enterie fever
which I have had to treat among the English and
Americans, only nine have occurred amongst the
visitors, and all recovered, and of these nine six
were ill of the disease when they arrived in Cairo,
having contracted it in Palestine (two), Naples
(two), Luxor, and during a Nile voyage. Of the
three remaining cases, one young lady had the
fever in 1883, when Cairo was much more insani-
tary than it is to-day; a second caught it in 1888,
while living against medical advice in a house
where there was no pretence of sanitation ; and
the third was the English maid of the second,
who sickened after she and her mistress had been
removed to a clean house. After making careful
inquiry of my sanitary and medical colleagges,
I have not been able to hear of any ease of enteric
among European civilians during the winter of
1888-9, excepting a few eases all imported from
elsewhere.

Cholera visited Egypt in 1865 and in 1883, but
not since, and the theory that it was endemic in the
country has not been borne out by late experience.


Cairo. 47

Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but
only from August to November: it is a painful
malady, without danger to life. Typhus and
relapsing fevers occur in the spring, among over-
crowded natives, but no case has been known
among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we
hope for ever, in 1814. Small-pos, as in other
parts of the world, is liable to occur among
those insuffieiently protected by vaccination, but
I remember only one case of a visitor and one
of a, resident. The deaths from small-pos in Cairo
for 1886-7-8, have averaged forty. Measles oeea-
sioually occurs as an epidemic among the natives,
and causes many deaths ; but I know of no visitors
who have caught the disease, and only a dozen
residents. Rotheln I have not yet heard of in
Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard
of at very rare intervals among the British troops.
Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,
and every now and then attacks Europeans Who
live in insanitary houses. Whooping-cough is
almost unknown, mumps very rare, and the ordi-
nary influenza eatarrh of England is uncommon.
Congestion of the liver is more likely to attack
alcoholic residents than visitors, and both classes
are liable to pleurisy or pneumonia, if they persist
in imprudent exposure at night. Phthisis does not
occur among white residents, though, on the other


48 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

hand, there are plenty of doctors and others in
Cairo who came to the country as confirmed con-
sumptives, and are now hurd-working and appa-
rently healthy members of the community. The
disease attacks blacks, who are, of course, living
as foreigners in a cold northern latitude ; and those
of the Egyptians who are saturated by scrofula.
or sypl1ilis may fall a prey to it.

Malaria is almost tmon-existent in Cairo, and
this is the more wonderful because many of the
causes in other countries would seem to be present.
During September and October those living on the
river-banks are liable to contract mild intermittent
or simple continued fever, but at other times of
the year even those who have suffered in India and
elsewhere are free of malavious attacks.

Ophthalmia in its granular form I have never
seen among any visitors or among Et1glisl1 resi-
dents who are ordinarily careful of their eyes; the
catarrhal opldhalmia occurs among many who
live in the country, and is troublesome when_the
winds laden with imperceptibly fine dust are
blowing. The best protection is to wear gauze
goggles to keep out the glare and dust, to use a.
saturated solution of boracie acid to wash the
eyes as a toilet requisite, and to employ, when
necessary, weak collyria of sulphate of zinc.

Those who persistently drink muddy water are


Cairo. 49

liable to become the hosts of various entozoa.
Sunstroke even in its slightest forms can only be
obtained on exceptional days by some great impru-
denee on the part of the individual.
Water-supply.---) Egyptian towns get their
(lrinking-water direct from the Nile, or indirectly
from the canals fed by the Nile. The Cairo Water
Company, which has a complete monopoly for
many years, has lately, under pressure from the
Sanitary Department, made some important im,
provements in the supply. The intake is now'
from the Nile itself, but used to be from a canal,
which during the summer months was liable to
become stagnant ; it has been proposed to remove
the intake some four miles higher up the river,
above all source of contamination. The water is
pumped to the flliitbeds u Abbassiyeh, whence,
after filiruion, it returns to the town for Coll-
sumption ; all the European quarters are now sup-
plied with filtered water, the daily average being
about 20,000 cubic metres. The velocity of the river
at high Nile is about five feet a second, or nearly
three and l half miles an hour; but at low Nile,
the velocity is reduced to at least one-fifth of this.
The filter-beds are on raised ground in the
desert, and consist, in the first place, of two huge
tanks, into which the water is always flosvi11g;
from these it is admitted into eight filter-beds,
E

each of about 2700 square yards, and after filhuv.
tion it is received into two closed reservoirs.
The filters are 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of
sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which
come from the Red Hill at Abbassiyeh, before men-
tioned. The sand is pure white, from a. pit be-
tween a pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine
and a lower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is
far removed from all danger arising from the
neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for
getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,
because the workmen discovered they were near
the dry osseous remains of an unknown mediieval
burying-place. The sand is all washed before
being used, and the superficial layers of the beds
are removed every four days in the summer, and
every eight (lays in the winter, when the watel is
less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only
changed two 01' three times a year, which is pro-
bably not often enough. The beds and plant are
under the constant inspection of the Sanitarypr
partment, who have also made some interesting
analyses of the fllieved Nile water. Table IV.
shows the results of twenty-three analyses made
during twelve months, by Mr. F. E. Pollard, F.I.C.,
F.G.S., who has made a speciality of the subject.
The samples were taken in nsid-siream, one yard
below the surface, and about one hundred yards north
of Kasr-el-Nil bridge, near the Company's intake.

52 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

The water, when filtered through double paper,
is perfectly clear, and has a greyish yellow colour,
varying in depth, but always to be observed in
thin glass vessels. Its taste is usually considered
very agreeable, and the Arabs have a proverb that
he who once drinks it becomes enamoured of
Egypt. At the foot of the table I have made a
comparison between the average water of the year,
the average of the winter months (November 3 to
May 18)-wlu'el1 is seen to be much less thick
before filtered, and a little purer than the year's
average after filtration-and also the water of the
New River Company which supplies the north of
London and the City, and is purer than that fur,
nished by the Thames Companies. It will be seen
that the Cairo water compares satisfactorily with
that of London.

The amount of oxygen absorbed was determined
by the French offieial process. The amount of
chlorine varies very considerably, and this has
already been pointed out. by Professor Wanklynf
who explains the variability by saying that the
storm-water of the flood sweeps over the surface of
ground long ago denuded of salt, and therefore
furnishing but little chlorine. On the other hand,
when the river has fallen, it receives water which
has passed deeper into the ground, and which has

* " Water Analysis," 1879, p. 152,


Cairo. 53

undergone concentration by evaporation, besides
having washed the lower strata, from which it
extracts chlorine.

As a eonfirmation of this, we see that the
chlorine is at its maximum just before the annual
flood.

The deficie11ey of nitrates is interesting, but does
not necessarily show an absence of defilement. The
softness of the water makes it very agreeable for
all domestic purposes ; the slight variation in hard-
ness is due to carbonate of lime, through which
the river has cut its way. The analyses of 1888-0
showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,
and no nitrites, and IIeisch’s sewage test never
gave the slightest evidence of sewage eoniamina-
tion.

The 1o11filtered water should never be drunk by
visitors 01' residents, though the natives prefer it
'mfhlitel.y. Some imprudent tourists drink it from
the dirty porous jars of the villagers, and must not
wonder at suffering occasionally in consequence.

The suspended matter, which is the chief ferti-
lizing ingredient of the Nile, varies in quantity in
the most wonderful way. Mr. Pollard’s figures
vary from '9 in July, to 1618 in September,
while Dr. Lethehy found 33 in May, 1875, and
104U grains in August, 1874. The fertility of the
flood, besides the clay, is due to the organic matter,

and bo the salts of potash and phosphoric acid dis-
solved and suspended in it. I should add that a
very laudatory report on the Cairo Company's
water, was made in 1889, by Professor Miintz, of
the National Agricultural Institute of Paris.

The water, before being drunk in Cairo, is
passed through large earthenware jars, which are
found in every house, and constitute an excellent
filter, removing every trace of colour and cloudi-
ness and all deposit, after the water has been
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. Drinking-
water is further poured into porous vessels, where
it is kept deliciously cool, and gains an agreeable
taste. Charcoal filters and boiling are not neces-
sary, but there is no difficulty about carrying this
out, if desired.


Cairo. 55

Most of the ice bought in Cairo is made from
the filtered water by the Water Company.

Seacenyiny.-Beiore 1885 it was only the streets
of the European quarters that were cleaned, and
this work was done at shameful expense by a con-
tractor employed by the Governor of Cairo. Now
the work is well done by the Sanitary Department
all over the town, and at a less cost than before.
All streets are kept swept, the made roads are
watered by carts every day, and the narrow lanes in
the native quarters are watered by the inhabitants
with goat-skins. Up till 7 a.m. the householders
are allowed to deposit in the street in heaps their
dry refuse, which is collected in carts, and either
burnt in the Turkish baths or shot outside the
town. This successfully prevents all the dust-bin
nuisances, and is very important in rm Oriental
country where women and children seldom leave
the house, and are unprovided in the poorest cases
with water-closets.

Cessponls and drains.--ut few English residents
have nothing but earth-closets in their houses;
others have, during my own sanitary knowledge
of the country, established cemented eesspools,
which are carefully trapped and ventilated, and
from which the faeeal matter and urine are removed
by an odourless pneumatic system (Tallard) by
night. To this category belong all the hotels and


56 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

houses Which one can safely recommend, and
under existing circumstances this is the best
arrangement that can be made to protect house-
holders from the chance of being poisoned by their
neighbours. It is satisfactory to those of us who
have laboured for sanitary reform to know that
all individual houses and hotels protected with
care have escaped such diseases as enteric and
diphtheria, and, moreover, are less troubled by
mosquitoes, which are baffled by the Syphon traps.
But, unfortunately, the bulk of Cairo, and most of
the mosques which act as public latrines, are pro-
vided with uueemented cesspools, draining into the
porous earth for most of the year, and becoming
dangerously filled by the high Nile in summer,
and it is this which demands urgent reform.
Happily, the European quarters of the town are
quite modern, and the soil has not yet had time to
become saturated with sewage, and the native parts
have only quite recently obtained a supply of water.
The capituluious protecting all Europeans, and
the apathy and ignorance of the native Govern-
ment, have hitherto prevented any radical measures
being taken; but in 1889 the Government employed
Mr. Baldwin Latham to thoroughly examine the
sanitary condition of Cairo, and to report upon
what steps should be taken to improve it. This
is a great step in the right direction, and it is


Cairo. 57

eorafide11tly hoped that money may at once be
found for carrying out these reforms.

Until then individuals must continue to protect
themselves by cutting off all communication with
the ground, and by carefully trapping and venti-
lating all pipes.

In the mean time, all street-sewers have been
blocked and destroyed, because they are unneces-
sary for storm water, and because it was found
that house proprietors used them as overflows for
their cesspools, and thus vitiated the fresh air of
the streets. At the same time some gnspipes, which
were too small, made of zine, and allowed leakage
in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,
have been removed, and replaced by six-inch iron
pipes, which are a great improvement. All cess-
pools 'are now prevented from draining into the
Nile or canals, and are obliged to be emptied at
least every six months, those of the cemented type
of course requiring to be emptied much oftener.
The sewage is taken in patent shut carts to
Abbassiyeh desert by night, at the rate of over 30,000
tons a year. There it is deodorized and sifted, and
sold to the fellaheen as ct poudrette " u £2 'a ton
for use on their lands. These changes, though not
nearly radical enough, have already contributed
greatly to the comfort and health of the European
inhabitants.


58 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Hotels.--) following, is a list of the principal
hotels in Cairo, in the order of their available accom-
modation, but not necessarily in order of merit. The
prices are for one bedroom per day, but they are all
capable of reduction if the visitor proposes a long
stay. Private sitting-rooms are an extra charge.

sYerv-1(rs.; 175 bedrooms (some new in 1889);
electric lighting ; excellent position ; pays a rental
annually of nearly S4000 ; could be made perfectly
sanitary with ease; fireplaces.

sSlveplveard's-16ss. ; 150 bedrooms (a few new
with balconies in 1889); electric bells; fireplaces;
and many modern improvements to please the
English ; lawn-tennis court; smolri11g-eoom and

fully cemented and trapped.

exclusively English; cesspools cemented at sides,
but not on their floors. -

Jfhedivial-10s. ; 58 beds.

Trictoria---12s.; 53 bedrooms in three detached
houses in apretty rose-garden ; clients 'all English
and American ; two cemented and two uneemented
cesspools.


Cairo. 59

Du Nil-12s. ; 50 beds ; clients mostly German;
is in a bad neighbourhood, but much frequented by
artists and others who want to be near the native
quarters.

All the above hotels have taken some pains about
sanitary improvements during the last sis years,
and those which specially desire the English
custom are now in fairly good order, but some of
the others retain as yet their old system. In none
of the above hotels has there been any case of
enteric fever arising in Cairo itself during the
season of 1888-9. There are, of course, several
smaller hotels which I have not here mentioned.

Pensions.---" these again there are several, two
of which may be mentioned: f.smailieh-13,s.; 40
beds; three private sitting-rooms; two general
sitting-rooms; piano, etc. ; baths; douehes; gym-
nastic apparatus, ete.; much frequented by the
English. Couteret--10s.; 30 beds.

Lodgings, furnished and unfurnished, can be
obtained during the season, but they are either
very expensive or not very good, as all rents are
very high in Cairo. Moreover, visitors outside a
hotel may find it difrleult to have servants who do
not talk their language easily.

Clnbs.---There are two excellent clubs, at one of
which there are some residential chambers for
temporary members.


BO Egypt as a Winter Resort.

CUrriayes.-The ordinary street carriage is a
comfortable two»horsed Victoria at a modest tariff.
There are landaus for those who wish them, and
also broughams for going out at night. The roads
are wide and good, and shaded better than almost
any other city with avenues of acacia (Albizzia
lebbek), so that can‘iage-exereisc is rendered very
easy and agreeable.

h"idiv-Eseellent country-bred and Syrian
ponies can be hired by the day, but a visitor intend.
ing to spend the winter generally does better to
buy a mount for £18 " £25. Donkey-riding is
very cheap, very healthy, and at times enjoyable.
Camels can be obtained for the desert, but are out
of place in crowded streets rendered slippery by
watering.

Dottorr-Commencing with our own country-
men, there are two Aberdouians, who have been
respectively twenty-seven and nine years in Egypt,
and a Londoner, who has practised in Cairo for
six years. There is another Englishman who
practises chiefly among the natives, and has a
growing surgical reputation; six English doctors
in the Government service are available for consul-
tation; and there are always a similar number in
the English Army. There are German, Scotch,
and American oculists, a good English dentist,
and more than a dozen foreign medical men (some


Cairo. Gl

speaking English), who are held in the highest
repute among their various colonies.

There are good rubbers of both sexes, and some
trustworthy chemists accustomed to English p1'e-
scripiions.

Ahtrses.--Bcsides foreign nurses, there are three
Englishwomen trained in English hospitals avail.
able for private cases, and there is now a Nursing
institution in connection with the native hospital,
from Which two 01' three English ladies trained in
London hospitals may be obtained on application
to the secretary.

Chttrches.--The English Protestant church was
opened in 1876, and has lately been enlarged.
The English colony is fortunate in possessing a
very popular chaplain, who is beloved by all.
There are two Roman Catholic Churches, , German
Lutheran, an American Presbyterian, and many
Greek and Coptic places of worship.

flhopr-Shopping is now very easy in Cairo,
because, in addition to a few English shops, at all
good establishments there are men who talk
English 01' French, and all civilized requisites at
a fixed price can now be obtained. The native
bazaars are a constant source of enjoyment to
residents and visitors, and the only objection to
them is that some of them are near insanitary
houses.


62 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Library.-Besides booksellers in the town, there
is a very good circulating library with more than
two thousand popular works, including many
relating to Egypt. This is a recent improvement,
and greatly appreciated by travellers.

Hospital-Paying, patients are received at a
German and at an Austrian hospital, but the
former is generally patronized by the English who
desire hospital treatment and the kind nursing of
Kaiserwerth deaconesses. The female wards of
the native hospital for free patients are now under
English management, and can sometimes be visited
by special permission.

Theatres.--0airo boasts of a very pretty opera-
house, with {L splendid stage, for which Verdi
wrote "Aida" in the days of the late Kl1edive's
extravagance. It is generally hired during the
winter months by a French or Italian Company,
and at other times by travelling actors, among
whom have been Sarah Bernhardt and M. Coquelin.
At a second theatre there is often Italian comedy,
to be seen, and a wandering circus visits us every
year.

The Ezbekieh Gardens are named after a, mosque
built by the Emir Ezbeky, a general of Eait Bey
in 1486, and destroyed to make room for the
Court of Mixed Tribunals. A desolate piece of
swampy ground was in 1870 converted into a

picturesque garden of twenty and a half a-cres by
the landscape gardener to whom Paris owes the
Bois de Boulogne. The gardens are skilfully laid
out, and, being close to the hotels, are a useful
resort by day for those who cannot take active
exercise; but after sunset they are liable to be
damp, in consequence of the perpetual watering of
the ground and the presence of 'd, small lake.
Grass grows with diffieulhy' in Cairo, and the
Lippia noditlorro is made to take its place. There
is a good restaurant, which is in great request
during the summer, when military bands play in
the gardens after dinner. There are very few
trees 01' shrubs with which we are familiar in
English gardens, but ivy may be seen with the
cactus clinging to stately palms. Australia has
furnished the she-oak and the beef-wood tree;
there are sparmannia from the Cape of Good
Hope; and from South America, clumps of Cocos
trees,si1k cotton trees, and l1aluuhamnus. Among
the most noticeable trees are the blue flowering
Jacaranda mimosifolia, the Jv'rythrina cristoyalli,
and the pepper-tree from Brazil; the lovely orange-
red flowering, flamboyant (Poieteiana veyia) from
Madagascar, which is now planted in some of the
Cairo streets; the mossy-eupped oak from Con-
stantinople; the Malabar nut, frangipanni, red
bean tree, and pudding-pipe tree from India; the

rice paper and the Hibiscus rosasmensis from
China; the Ccesalpinia Gilliesii of Peru; and the
sacred tree of Nubia (Kigicla pinnata). Many of
the trees have now been labelled, and among them
may be found the Norfolk Island pine, Indian
beech, Yucca gloriusa, twenty different kinds of
figs, the India horse-chestnut, the A cacia farnesiarta,
and towering indiarubber trees. Then one sees
also tropical sedge, oleanders which are bright
with all colours in April and May, and many
commoner varieties too numerous to mention.
Here and there in the garden are solitary giants
of the Albiezia lebbek, which was introduced into
Egypt one hundred and fifty years ago, and, besides
making beautiful avenues in Cairo, has now spread
all over the country. It grows with great rapidity
and with extraordinary ease, and requires no water-
ing after the first few years. Unfortunately it has
lately been attacked by the larva of a beetle, and
some of the oldest trees have died in consequence.

Flora-Almost the only strictly indigenous
trees in Egypt are the tamnrisk, the sunt (Acacia
Nilotica), and the syeamore-fig, but the flora
consist of about 1400 specimens. Among, the
many successfully introduced trees is the J erusalem
thorn (Parkinsmzia aculcata), Which flourishes
espeeially in the desert at Abbassiyeh and Helouan.
The lotus is found in Cairo in the spring, but is

rather rare, and the papyrus is no longer a native
of Egypt. Dr. Seluveinfurtl1 believes that the
Egyptian oases were colonized by Berbers with
the cereals of the Mediterranean basin, but that
the valley of the Nile was colonized by Indian
races who brought their own cereals.

Avw.seoumts.-Cairo with its bright clear weather,
lends itself so easily to an outdoor life that no
one will be surprised to hear that the English
colony has introduced some British sports. If we
cross the Nile by its iron bridge, we at once come
to a large park between the river and one of its
branches. Here there are about fifty acres of
grass belonging to the Ghezireh Sporting Club,
and devoted to polo, cricket, football, golf, lawn-
tennis, pigeon-shooting, etc. There is a course for
riding and for leaping, and every winter there are
two race meetings of two days each, three Skye
meetings, and sis or seven Gymkhauas. Visitors
may become temporary members of the club on
paying £22. A regimental band plays most after-
1100ns, and it is naturally the most favourite resort
in Cairo. Our foreign friends sometimes play
lawn-tennis, but usually eonfine themselves to
looking on at the English. There are half a dozen
lawn-tennis courts in the town, facilities for boxing
and fencing, and excellent hacks for riding 01'
driving all over the country.


66 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

The resources of the Nile have not yet been
developed, and there is but little rowing, sailing,
fishing, or swimming.

Shooting.---) visitor who wants big game will
be disappointed in Egypt; but, on the other hand,
he can get plenty of quail, duck, and snipe. He
must bring an ordinary breech-loading gun with
him, but all cartridges must be bought in Cairo,
one maker having the exclusive monopoly. In
1889 an English visitor rode down and shot three
wolves (Canis mrirgmus) beyond the Pyramids,
but this is a unique experience. Ibex can be
shot in the mountains near Suez; gazelle are very
shy everywhere; wild pig can be got in the
Fayoum and at Broullos, and lynx near Tel-el-
Kebir; and in the desert there are jackal,hyema,
fox, bare, and the long-cared Fennec fox. From
October to March there is good snipe, duck, and
goose shooting, and from February to May there
is an abundance of quail. In February, 1889,
two English visitors made a. bag of forty duck and
four hundred snipe in five days at Kafr-el-Sheikh,
and this is only an instance of what many others
have done. One hundred and twenty quail have
been shot by two guns on the road to the Pyramids
in March, between luncheon and dinner. Pigeon-
shooting in the villages can be obtained all the
year round, because pigeons are kept for the sake


Cairo. 67

of their ma'uure, and the natives are delighted at
times to have some of the surplus birds killed.
In January, 1880, two good shots brought down
282 pigeons within three hours at Beliana. Sand-
grouse and plover can also be shot in the spring.
No gun licence is necessary.

Siyht-seeiny.--There is a great deal to see in
and near Cairo, enough to occupy a serious-minded
individual for more than one winter, and fair
accounts of most of the sights may be found in
the guide-books. Besides the bazaars already
mentioned, where the products not only of Egypt,
but of Syria, Turkey, Persia, Tunis, and Asia
Minor may be bargained for, the original walls
and gates are well worth visiting. They date from
the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the old
parts of the town, which are completely Oriental
and highly picturesque, contain houses Which have
been built at all times during the last six hundred
years. Many streets still exist where beautiful
mushribyeh windows are numerous, and where
minarets and mosques produce a, view which is
not seen in any other city. No greater change
can be experienced in leaving those Coptic and
Arab quarters than to find one's self in the
European district where broad streets are laid
out, and European houses and shops have been
built since 1805.


68 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

A characteristic view of the town and the
Pyramids plateau can be obtained from the citadel,
especially at sunset, and leave should be sought
to visit the English military hospital there, which
is one of the finesse in the world. The Turkish
baths are not particularly clean 01' well cared for.

Jlosyter-There are in Cairo some three
hundred mosques, many of which are worth visit-
ing. The following is a list of those which show
best the wonderful art of the Saracens. They are
placed in chronological order, and date from A.D.
640 to A.D. 1503. Amr, Ibn Tuluu, Azhar, El
Hakim, El Sl1afiy (mausoleum), Kalaun, El Mari-
dany, Ahsunhur (bluediled), Sultan Hassan, Bar-
kuk, El Muayyad, Eait Bey, El Ghory (two).
No visitor should miss seeing the Khedivial
Library, Which contains an unrivalled collection
of Korans, Commentaries on the Koran, and
Traditions, many of Which have been taken for
safe keeping out of the mosques above mentioned.
Then, too, there is the Museum of Arab art, where
are lamps of brass and of glass, chandeliers,
tables, old mosque doors inlaid with ivory, and
many other beautiful treasures, snatched a few
years ago from the interior of uncared-for mosques.

Coptic elrttreloes.-These are deeply interesting,
because the old buildings are in good preservation,
and in their construction and fittings give us as


Cairo. 69

accurate a picture of early Christian worship as
can anywhere be found. Some of them still have
eonvents adjoining, and are surrounded by thick
walls like a fortress, telling tales of old persecution
about the days of the fifth century, when the Bible
was translated into the Coptic tongue.

Besides some of the usually visited churches in
old Cairo, a Copt should be engaged to take the
visitor to the Church of the Virgin, near the
Muuski, where may be seen the original type of
the Coptic basilica, with a baldaorhino supported by
four columns and semicircular stone seats arranged
round the apse, and indeed much else of interest.

The modern Coptic cathedral is only worth
visiting, to see the service, such as on Easter Eve
01' Easter Day; but it must be remembered that
their festivals sometimes bake place according to
0111' calendar, and sometimes by the Old Style,
twelve days later.

A riding or driving excursion Will of course be
made to tho neeropolis of Knit Bey, and to the
so-called tombs of the Memlooks,

The palaces of Shoobra, Ghezirch, and Ghizeh
are all worth visiting if a permit can be obtained,
because they have lovely gardens, and remind one
of the former glories of late Khedives. It is to the
last of these three that the Boulak Museum is now
being transferred.


70 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Visitors interested in Oriental education will like
to see the Polytechnic School, that of the Arts and
Sciences, a charity for the deaf,dumb, and blind, and
the useful work started by the late Miss Whahely.

The ordinary visitor demands at once to be
taken to see the howling and dancing dervishes,
and there are many other more interesting sects
whose monasteries he may visit if he will. Perhaps
one may be forgiven for reminding him that their
fantastic worship plays to the Mussulman religion
a part something analogous to the Salvation Army
section of the Protestant Church.

But whether the traveller comes for days, weeks,
OI' months, let us impress upon him the absolute
duty of visiting Beulah Museum, and of not neg-
lecting his chance of seeing monuments as old as
the Pyramids, wooden statues of much the same
date, a unique assembly of royal mummies and
portraits painted years before the Old Masters.
The great objection to the museum is that most of
the objects are not labelled, and that the catalogue
is atrociouslybad. We may see there the jewellery
worn by an Egyptian queen three thousand six
hundred years ago, a trilingual inscription not
unlike the "Rosetta stone," and tables of kings
like the famous slab from Abydos. The museum
is better than any in Europe, and is rich especially
in monuments of the earliest Dynasties.


Cairo. 71

Festivtds.-Thers are several old Eg ptian and
Coptic holidays which have the advantage of being
on fixed dates, and can therefore be easily seen by
reference to guide-books. But the purely Mussul-
man functions take place according to the Moham-
medan calendar, the year of which is Ill days
less than our own. The following dates are an
approximate guess at the principal feasts; but it
must be remembered that the actual date is often
changed either as :1. matter of convenience, 01'
to cause the chief holiday to fall upon the eve of
Friday--

CHAPTER V.
EXCURSIONS FROM CAIRO.

I HAVE already said that the favourite ride Oh' drive
is in the direction of Ghezireh, where on Fridays
and Sundays there is always a crush of carriages;
but those who love peace will be happier on the
roads leading to the Pyramids, or Heliopolis, 01'
Shoobra, all soft, good roads, well shaded by the
sycamoredig " other trees.

Desert.--Ior visitors who can ride a. great treat
is in store. The desert can be reached on all sides
most easily, and supplies a capital galloping
ground and invigorating air which seems to put
fresh life into both horse and rider. The popular
idea in England is that 'a desert is always one
vast plain of dazzling sand without undulations
and without signs of life, and that at every step
the luckless traveller must sink ankle-deep in
tiring sand. The reality is a series of hills and
valleys with innumerable changes of colour, and
of lights and shades, and a crisp, firm ground upon


Excursions from Cairo. 73

which we can walk for miles without getting tired.
Moreover, our desert is by no means a perfect
desert like the Sahara, devoid of vegetation.

In February, after the winter rain, green herbs
and bushes sprout in the hollows, ravines, and
valleys, and the flora are at their finest in March
and April. After this the sun becomes too hot
for them, and in the summer only the deeper-
rooted trees and shrubs remain. The desert thorn
is beloved by camels; the zygophyllums are very
common and always succulent, but they are too
salt except for the hungriest camels. The bitter
colocynth and senua are used by the Bedouins.
The desert flora are by no means rich, but a
hundred species can be collected by diligent
amateurs, and the number of possible species
is sis hundred. Desert plants cannot be culti-
vated in gardens; but, on the other hand, those
species that have found their way from civilized
spots into the wilds, seem to thrive nntended in
the desert. Rabbits, hares, foxes, jerboas, and
lizards, all desert-coloured like the camel, are the
animals one meets with most often. In the neigh- .
bourhood of any old necropolis, we find bits of
granite and other monuments which have now
disappeared; relics of the llint age may be found
by careful searching, and many geological remains,
including numerous fragments of petrified wood.


74 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

It is a favourite donkey-ride towards the so-ealled
petrified forest, and on the way one passes the
Red Hill, which is composed of a. very hard Miocene
conglomerate of sand, pebbles, and fossil wood.
The two Colossi at Thebes were made of this stone,
and it is now used for maeadamizing, roads, and
for making millstones.

Mineral springs-About half an hour south of
Cairo there is a spring in the desert, called Ain-
cl-Sym. There is a. dark greenish basin some
fifty yards square, surrounded by limestone forma..
tions, and with a thick deposit of black sulphur
mud. It has a great reputation among the natives
for skin-eruptions and especially for scabies, and its
votaries also drink from the sulphur spring which
feeds the basin, and which rids them of dyspepsia
and constipation. The temperature of the water is
104° Fahr. beneath the surface, and 644° at the
surface on a winter day. Specific gravity P092.

Abu-el-Stroud is another water named after an
Egyptian doctor of the fiftccrdl1 century. It is
without colour and odour, and keeps well in a hot
country. It is in great request among some
Europeans and natives for disorders of digestion,
and it has a distinct aperient effect. Its source
is said to be from the Mokntmm hills, and it is
drunk at an establishment in Old Cairo, or bottled
there for home use. There is also a, swimming
bath there of temperature 86° Fahr. No accurate
analysis has yet been made. Reaction neutral;
no gas; temperature, 86° Fahr. The principal
ingredients are sulphates of soda and magnesia,
and chlorides of sodium, magnesium, and calcium.
There are no nitrates or ammonia.

The Barrage should certainly be visited, if it
is only to see how the pluck and skill of English
engineers have made it possible for some nine feet
of water to be held up at the times when every
drop of the Nile is wanted for la11d-irrigration.
It is a long ride, but a. very pleasant trip by
steamer 01' by train, and the neighbourhood is very
pretty.

Scrhbirah.-Tlse pleasantest way of making this
excursion is by steamer to and from Cairo; but
even then there is a two hours' donkey-ride from
the landing-place to the Necropolis. If a steamer
cannot be obtained, it is quite possible to go by


76 Eyypt as a Winter Resort.

train; or delicate people who wish to minimize the
fatigue may sleep at Helouau overnight, and cross
the river next morning. Those who love riding
can mount their ponies at Mena Hotel, and ride
along the desert to Salrldwah, passing the Pyra-
mids of Abooseer and the remains of several miles
of cemeteries. The day's excursion is a very
delightful one, but it is very tiring to those unac-
customed to donkey-riding. Early in the winter the
scenery is quite lovely-the inundation covering
the fields, and the peasants swarming up the lofty
date palms to gather the fruit which grows so well
on the site of Memphis. In the spring the waters
have subsided again, and the mounds and pottery
which represent the old city, can be better seen.

A huge fallen statue of Bameses II. was raised
out of a pond by a. few English subscribers m
1897, and in working, at it another colossus was

discovered close by. It is not generally known that
. the Egyptian antiquities on Shepheard's balcony
came from Sakkfrah, and bear evidence of having
been visited in situ by Greek tourists, who scribbled
their names in the days long ago before the stones
were buried in sand, and then once more dis-
covered by Mariette. Boulak and many European
museums have been largely enriched by the trea-
sures of Saliluivah, which represents about four
square miles of the neeropolis of Memphis. The


Excursions from Cairo. 77

monumental wonders are suffieientiy set forth in
the guide-books; but some of them are kept pur-
posely buried in the sand to prevent destruction.
It is usually said that the mummiod bulls from
the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer
accidentally found three of them in 1887 in the
Historical Soeiety's Museum in New York. They
were probably stolen and bought when the Sera-
peum was discovered in 1861. The tomb of Till, of
the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such
excellent preservation that it should be visited by
all; and there is another tomb kept closed which
is by no means inferior. From these life-like
sculptures and others much has been learnt about
the manners and customs of those who lived more
than five thousand years ago.

Recent discoveries in Eyyptt--Full accounts of
the late discoveries of Mr. Flinders Petrie, and
of Mr. Naville for the Egyptian Exploration Fund,
hare been published in their special transactions,
but not yet in the guide-books, so the remainder of
this chapter will be devoted to recapitulating them
for the benefit of travellers who desire to visit the
spots which have been worked during the English
occupation.

1. Commencing with Lower Egypt, we have

' Mr. I’ctrie has kindly suppliud we with much valuable infor-
mation for this purpose.


78 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Pithon (Tel-eI-Maskhuta), near the modern station
called Ramcses, between Zagazig and Ismailia.
From here statues have been sent to Boulak and
the British Museum, and there are still remains
of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and of the More-
chambers built by the Israelites.

2. Goshen (Saft-el-Hennah), near the railway
stations of Zagazig and Abu Hamad, A large
sculptured shrine of the Thil'tieth Dynasty now in
Boulak came from there, but to-day there is
nothing of special interest on the site.

3. Tanis (San-el-Haggar), twenty miles from
Fakus by boat or donkey, and therefore rather
troublesome to reach. There is an enormous
temple, with statues of different periods from
Twelfth to Nineteenth Dynasties, and it is the
finest place for the tourist to visit till he gets
southward to Thebes. It was excavated by Mariette
and finished by Mr. Petrie, and large numbers of
papyri were sent from it to the British Museum.

4. Tel Bedowi and Nehesheh stand half-way
from Fakus io Tanis, and have furnished many
gifts to the British Museum. There are still the
temple of Aahmes of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, a
large shrine of Umti, and tombs and cemetery.

5. Zagazig (Tel Basta, or the Pibeseth of the
Old Testament). There are records dating from
the Fourth to Thirtieth Dynasties, and from here


Excursions from Cairo. 79

came the large statues of the Hyksos period, and
columns were removed to Boulak, British Museum,
and the United States. The rest of the temple is
still standing.

6. Onias (Tel-elalaoudi), near the station of
Shibeen-eLKauater. There was a Twentieth
Dynasty palace, now destroyed, and there are
tombs of a Greeo0ewisl1 colony, a large Roman
camp, and walls of plastered guard-houses three
feet high.

7. Daphne (Defneh or Tahpanhes of Old Testa-
ment), twelve miles from Snlnhieh station, OI' from
Kantnm on the Suez Canal. Here there are
remains of the fort mentioned by Jeremiah, and
a Greek camp around it; Twenty-sixth Dynasty,
or 6604560 B.0. Large quantities of painted
archaic Greek pottery now in the British Museum
came from here.

8. Naucratis (Tel Gaiei), fire miles from Teh-
el-Baroud station. Here we may still see the site
of the Greek town and temples to Apollo, Aphro-
dite, Dioseuri, etc., and by searching, many small
objects and painted pottery can be found, date
660 B.0. to 200 A.D. A great deal of archaic Greek
pottery was taken from here to the British Museum.
It will be remembered that the site of Naueraiis
was quite lost, until one day Mr. Petrie was shown
by a Bedouin a piece of 'a Greek statue near Cairo,


80 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

and, following, up this clue, he discovered this
interesting buried city.

9. But it is not only in the Delta that much
has been brought to light. If the visitor will take
the train southwards to Medineh-el-Fayoum, and
entrust himself to a Greek inn lately opened there,
he will find the site of a large temple at the north
end of the town, and parts of a pylon still stand,
ing. Date from the Twelfth Dynasty to the time
of Ptolemy II.

10. Biahmu is six miles north of Mediueh-el-
Fayoum, and here are the pedestals of the eolossi
of Amer1-ernhat III., who made Lake Moeris and
the famous Labyrinth in the Twelfth Dynasty.
The fragments found here are now at Oxford.

11. Howara is four miles east of Medineh-el-
Fayoum. The Pyramid was tunnelled unsuccess-
fully from the north in 1888, and the true passage
was opened from the south in 1889. Date, Amen-
emhat III. and his daughter Ptah-nefru of the
Twelfth Dynasty. Her altar and her bowls are
now at Beulah, as also the finest set of amulets
known. The site of the Labyrinth is south of the
Pyramid, where fragments of it wan be seen. To
the north of the Pyramid is the cemetery from
Which the Roman portraits were sent to Beulah,
and to the National Gallery in London.

12. Illahun is thirteen miles east of Medineh-


Excursions from Cairo. 81

el-Fayoum, and fourteen miles from Beni-souef
station. Mr. Petric has now opened this Pyramid
also, and has cleared its temple, which is half a
mile to the east. Fragments of this temple are
now in England, dating from Usertasen ll. of the
Twelfth Dynasty. One of the most interesting
discoveries is that the town of the builders of this
Pyramid joins the temple on the north, and here
may be seen rows of houses for workmen and for
stores, and numerous fliai instruments lying
about. Many papyri and tools were found, and
pottery with Cypriote letters on it, thus proving
the early date of the Cypriote alphabet. There
is plenty of pottery of the Twelfth Dynasty lying
about; and to the west and south of the Pyramid
is a cemetery which was originally used by the
Twelfth Dynasty, and later used again from the
Twenty-first to the Twenty-sixth. Near the temple
are Coptic graves of the fourth century of the
Christian em.

13. Medineh Grob (ix. raven) is at the south
end of the Illahun dyke, which originally dated
from the Twelfth Dynasty, but has since shifted
its position. Here there is a town of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, built over the ruins of a temple of
Thothmcs III., and from here much Greek pottery
of the Myceme type, with Cypriote and Phoenician
letters on it, has been sent to the British Museum.

a


82 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Behind the town is a cemetery, the south end of
Which contains graves of the Eighteenth to the
Twentieth Dynasties, while the north was used
during the Ptolemaie period. Many Greek and
demotic papyri were found with the cartonnages of
the mummies, and Boulak is now the proud pos-
sessor of two large bronze pans and three wooden
statuettes of the Nineteenth Dynasty.

It is to be regretted that, while so much has been
done by English enterprise, Boulak should have
so few results to show from its own excavations.
Many of the antiquities found pass into the hands
of dealers; and so lately as 1888 several statues
of great value of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties
were found at Memphis, and had afterwards to be
bought by the Boulak Museum.

14. The cuneiform inscriptions of Tel-eI-Amarna,
the neeropolis of part of the Eighteenth Dynasty,
half-way between Cairo and Thebes, have lately
been deeiphered by Professor Sayce. From his
unique researches we find that, one hundred years
before the Exodus, active literary intercourse was
going on between Babylon, Egypt, Palestine, and
Syria, and this was carried on by means of the
Babylonian cuneiform writing. He believes that
Babylonian was as much the language of diplo-
macy and of cultivated society as French has been
in modern times, though it must have taken years


Excursions from Cairo. 83

of patient labour to read it. These tablets, so
recently brought to light, give ground for supposing
that there may be rich libraries buried in Syria
and Palestine of clay tables inscribed in cuneiform
characters.

CHAPTER VI.

'SUBURBS DF Camo-HEL-LES-Buss--
Psausurys-hfhruuymr.

HELOUAN is an artificial oasis in the desert, three
miles from the right bank of the Nile, and fifieen
miles south of Cairo. The railway connecting it
with the capital has in 1889 been brought into the
centre of the town, and various other improvements
have been made by the company to whom the
railway now belongs. The trains run to and fro
in forty minutes, and six times a day. The village
consists of a palace built by the present Khedive,
two hotels, about a hundred and fifty detached
private houses, and two engines for pumping up
Nile water. It is about 112 feet above the Nile
level, on a firm plateau of sand, and is famous for
a remarkably pure, dry, and dustless atmosphere.
It is surrounded on all sides by the desert, and on
the east by the continuation of the Mokattam
range of hills. But the property which makes the


Suburbs of Cairo. 85

table-land ot Holouan remarkable is that it is in
some places saturated with water like a sponge.
Water is found at a depth varying from ten inches
to ten feet, and, when coming out of the springs,
has " temperature of 77° or 85° IFahr., and the yield
from these springs is considerable. The water of
the sulphur springs is quite clear and colourless,
but, on being exposed for a short time to the air,
the surface becomes covered with a slight film of
sulphur and lime-salts. The water smells a little
of sulphuretted hydrogen, and is slightly saltish
without being unpleasant to drink. Up to the
present twelve springs have been discovered, and
may be divided into three classes-Sulphur, Iron,
and Saline.

1. Two of the Sulphur springs supply the Baths
which are attached to the chief hotel, and a third
has been led into a fountain, Where the poor of

There are two other sulphur springs, less warm
and containing much more salt, but they are not
being used at present. The sulphur waters
resemble those of Aix-les-Bains and Enghien
(Paris).

2. There are two Iron springs, the water of
which is pleasant to drink and is taken gratis by
large numbers of people. The bicarbonate of iron
in the water comes from the protoxide of iron in
the sand. The sand, which in the spring is black,
takes a yellowish-grey colour when dried in the
air, the protoxide being turned into sesquioxide
of iron. The water is clear, colourless, odourless,
and tastes a little salt and bitter. Temperature,

But, though I give an analysis of all three kinds
of waters, the only important one at present is the
sulphur variety. It owes its sulphur properties
to the chemical processes which sulphate of lime,
meeting with nitrogenous matter and becoming
sulphate of calcium, produces by setting free
carbonic acid and nitrogen from the decomposition
of the nitrogenous matter. Then the carbonic acid
decomposes the sulphate of calcium and forms
carbonate of lime, which, in presence of an excess
of carbonic acid and under great pressure, is con-
verted into a very soluble bicarbonate of lime,
which at last sets free sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
The nitrogenous organic matter which is found
in all the Helouan waters has been named Barégine,
because it was first discovered in the Baréges
waters of the Pyrenees. It is found in all sulphur
waters when exposed to light and air, and is the
cause of the greenish vegetation which collects
round the edges of stagnant sulphur water. The
sulphur is sufiieiently strong in the air to turn
silver ornaments black, but after the first day one
ceases to notice the odour.

Jlistory.-Ths village is said to take its name
from the great grandson of a certain untraceable
king of Egypt. It is known to have been fre-
quented in A.D. (M), and at other times by notables
who were driven out of Old Cairo by the plague,

but various fires have destroyed all trace of former
dwellings. There remain, however, for those who
dig, the Cebris of bricks, granite, marble, pottery,
glass, and even coins.

After the records of Arab historians we come
down to 1830, when Liuant Pasha, a French
engineer, discovered that the region of sulphur
springs extended southward from Helouau to
opposite Benisuef, where horings used to be made
by the natives, who bathed in the springs and built
tents near them. In 1819 the Egyptian Govern-
ment took possession of Helotmu, built wooden
huts, and even sent sick soldiers to be experimented
on by the waters. The results were so satisfactory
that the spot began to be a little popular, but it,
was not until 1871 that- the Government could
make up its mind either to work the springs itself
01' to let them to an intelligent European. In
that year a Dr. Reil was appointed Director
of the Baths, a small town began gradually to
spring up, and in 1873 the Grand Hotel was
built and was eonfided to its present manager.
Trees were planted, the swamps were drained,
and in 1876 a railway from Cairo was opened.
Great improvements have been made to the baths,
and the place is every yearbeeonliug 11i01'0 popular,
the number of baths during 1885 having been only
7031, and being new doubled every year.

Batlur.-fn an establishment where crowned
heads are visitors, and which humbly imitates the
huge establishments in Europe, it is needless to
say that no cost has been spared in putting the
bath-houses into excellent order. Special arrange-
ments are made for ladies, both natives and
Europeans. The corridors are paved With marble,
and fifteen bath-rooms and the actual baths are
made of enamelled porcelain tiles. Electric bells,
good furniture, ventilation, thermometer, sand-
glass, ete., are provided. There are shower-baths
and ordinary hot-water baths for those who do not
wish to undergo any cure, and delightful swim-
ming-baths for the two sexes. The bath-rooms are
kept beautifully clean, and the ascent and descent
is made easy for those who are too crippled to
walk. An inhalation-room is provided for the
asthmatics who wish to inhale sulphuretted gas
straight from one of the springs.

The water that has been used in the baths is
run off into the desert two miles away by cemented
covered drains, and these have also been utilized
for draining the marshy parts of the desert land.
The result has been that malaria has disappeared,
the air is drier, and the spot as :L health-resort is
rapidly increasing in popularity. An Austrian
medical man lives in the chief hotel, and has made
a. speciality of electricity and electric baths.


Suburbs of Cairo. Ol

A druggist is provided by the Government, but
many European visitors prefer to be dependent
upon Cairo for their doctors and drugs.

There are two hotels, the larger of which is in
connection with the baths, and has forty-six bed-
rooms, some of which are very large, also a lawn-
tennis court. There is easy telephone and tele-
graph communication with Cairo.

Furnished and unfurnished villas can be hired
near the Bath Establishment.

Coarse of baths.-TI1e water for the baths has
a temperature of about 86° Fahr. upon coming out
of the spring, and this can be ariifieially heated to
102°, or more, in pipes which prevent any evapora-
tion of gas. But it is doubtful whether it is ever
necessary to take the bath above 100°,fo1' hotter
baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.
The baths are open from 6 mm. to S p.111., and
may be taken as it suits the convenience of the
patient-say one hour before meals, or three or
four hours after meals. There can be no object
in taking more than one bath in the day, though
robust men who are in a. hurry to get through their
course can easily stand an occasional second bath
in the twenty-four hours. The beginner should
not stay in the water longer than fifteen minutes,
but he may gradually increase this to thirty
minutes. If he is not under medical supervision


92 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

the whole time, he should invariably report progress
to his doctor during the third week of the cure, as
a tonic is then often necessary, and he may be
unconsciously overdoing the treatment.

Delicate people should begin with a temperature
not above 98", should take a bath on alternate days,
and not for more than ten minutes at a time.

It is hardly necessary to remind patients whose
hearts are affected that they should have medical
advice upon the desirability of hot bathing. The
Helouan waters, as I have already said, are
stronger than those of Aix-les-Bains, but they have
not yet the advantage of being accompanied by all
the excellent system of douches and local massage
for which the Savoy resort is so famous.

Invalids are often chary of transporting them-
selves and their relatives from the gaieties of Cairo
to the solitude of Helouan, and to them it can
only be said that, if their physical strength per-
mits, they are easily able to live in Cairo, and to
go four or five days a week to Helouan to take
their baths. But though some men and a few
women prefer to do this, there can be no doubt that
the purer air, earlier hours, and complete repose
of the desert life are most useful adjuncts to the
sulphur baths-and such invalids occasionally need
reminding that they have come abroad for their
health, and not for the distractions of their friends.


Suburbs of Cairo. 93

When the course of baths is completed, a bracing
change is not necessary; but if it has taken place
in the spring, the sea-voyage to Europe seems
always beneficial.

The sulphur-water may be used not only in the
form of baths, but locally, as by fomentations,
gargles, or injections. When swallowed, its action
has hardly yet been determined, but it is apparently
quite harmless. The great value of Helouan is, of
course, in relation to the treatment of rheumatic
diseases, and such a senatorium during the winter
months is a boon to every prescribing physician
in inclement England. It is quite open to those
who desire to take their fill of sulphur baths to
spend the winter in Cairo and at Luxor, and take
th course of baths at Helouan at any time between
November and April, and then to proceed to Aix-
les-Bains, where the best time for a course is from
May 10 to June 10, as advised by Sir A. Garrod
and others. By skilful management, the rheumatic
patient can ensure remaining both at Helouan and
afterwards at Aix in 'a temperature which is very
like London in the warm days of July.

The number of baths at Helonnn is a very
important question. During the first week the
patient feels no result; during the second, his
rheumatic pains are a little increased; and during
the third, he feels great benefit from the baths,


94 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

though this benefit is likely to be increased still
further after he leaves the place. As the end of
the third week approaches he feels a little lassi-
tude and fatigue, and requires to be watched by a
careful eye. The number of baths varies from
eighteen or nineteen in delicate women who cannot
stand further heat, to twenty-four in robust
patients.

It is specially in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis that Helouan is most successful, improving
the patient's state at the time, and rendering him
less liable to acute attacks in the future, the im,
provements, as I have just said, often going on in
his system for six months.

As at all other similar establishments, there is
a favourable record of individual cripples who are
laboriously carried to the springs, and eventually
walk away wreathed in joy!

Helouan is not yet widely known to the medical
profession or to the public; but the cases of this
disease Which have given the bath a fair trial have
invariably improved.

Helouan is of no avail for cases of acute or
recent gout, and might even do harm by checking
the local manifestation of a constitutional poison.
In chronic gouty swelling or stiffness, or gouty
tendency, eczema, psoriasis, or in that form of
gout which is not connected with portal congestion,


Suburbs of Cairo. 95

the cure is of use, because the skin and kidneys
are made to not better, and the interval between
acute attacks may be prolonged.

Again, in suh-acuto rheumatism, or in cases With
recent cardiac mischief, the baths are not indi-
cated; but in all cases of chronic rheumatism,
whether of joints, muscles, or nerve-sheaths, great
benefit is always derived. Some troublesome cases
of sciatica, too, have got great good from Helouan,
and all local affections dependent on rheumatism
and gout, or connected with either of them, have
a good chance of being either cured or relieved.

As might be expected, some diseases of the skin,
such as eczema, acne, prurigo, ecthyma, scabies,
etc., get great benefit here, and it is believed that
the waters would prove of value in leprosy if a
separate establishment could be specially built for
the few natives afflicted with it. The baths have
been strongly recommended for inveterate cases
of syphilis, dysmenorrhasa, amenorrhea, endocer-
vieitis, leucorrhcea, some cases of sterility, cystitis,
and even diabetes. The inhalation and gargles are
said to be of use for bronchitis, asthma, and laryn-
geal, pharyngeal, and nasal eatarrh. Good has
often resulted from the employment of baths in
cases of old gunshot wounds, or in the stiffness
resulting from fractures or sprains. I advised {1,
patient once to try the baths for incipient locomotor

ataxy, but he found no benefit from them, and
believed that the hot water was distinctly injurious
to him.

Excursions-On all sides there is the desert for
walking or donkey-riding, and there are two roads
for carriage-exercise. Near the hills flint imple-
ments can be found. There are some old alabaster
quarries to visit, and in the same neighbourhood
is an old dam discovered by Professor Schwein-
furth.

Shooting-parties sometimes go out for gazelles,
hyenas, wolves, foxes, and jaekals.

I have already said that the trip to Sakkzirah
can very conveniently be made from Helouan, and
one can also go to the quarries of Toura and
Maaserah, which are of great extent and wonder-
fully interesting. From them came the stone
blocks and easing of the Ghizeh Pyramids, and {LS
the quarries are still used to supply flagstones, we
can compare the rough work of the present masons
with the dexterous neatuess of past ages. No
eartouel1es have been discovered in the quarries
older than the Twelfth Dynasty, and perhaps the
commonest seen to-day is that of Hakor of the
Twenty-ninth.

wine.

THE PYRAmDs.

Twenty-two years ago, visitors to the Pyramids
at Ghizeh were obliged to rise very early in the
morning, mount donkeys to the river’s edge,
whence they were ferried across, and had to be

ll


98 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

dependent again on donkeys for a long de'tour by
the banks of winding canals, till at last they
reached the desert, hastily visited the Pyramids,
and then had to return at once to reach Cairo
before sunset. Those who desired to devote a
longer time to the sights took out with them
tents, a cook, food, and a guard of Bedouins.

Now matters are all changed ; the tourist drives
from his hotel to the Great Pyramid in th little
more than an hour, and commonly makes the hip
between luncheon and dinner. There is a good
made road all the way, lined With trees, and
flanked on both sides either by the huge irrigation
basins during the autumn inundation, or by miles
of green cultivated land, in which buffaloes, children,
and camels are dotted about.

Mane Hotel.-Those who do not know the Cairo
of to-day will be most surprised at the existence
of a first-elass hotel at the foot of the Pyramids,
and juat seven miles from the head of the town.
Its history is this '. In 1884, an Englishman, suffer-
ing from chronic phthisis, bought from the Govern..
ment a desert property of three hundred acres,
including a house, in which he and his wife lived
very comfortably. He believed that the air was
more beneficial to him than that of the other health-
resorts he had tried, and though he had had a
moribund appearance for two years, he certainly


Suburbs of Cairo. oo

improved markedly in health and strength. He
remained there two winters and a summer, and
was progressing well until he was persuaded, during
the second summer, to try {1, change to the mountain
air of Cyprus, where he very soon died. Before
his death he had commenced to build a sanaborium,
to give others the opportunity of living in a elinmte
Which had apparently been so beneficial to himself.

The property was then bought by an English
resident of Cairo, who determined to open an hotel,
and, while providing visitors With all necessary
luxuries, to prevent the neighbourhood of the
Pyramids from being spoilt by incongruous beha-
viour. The hotel at once became popular, in con-
sequence of the extreme purity of the air, the
delicious repose of the desert, the convenient
proximity to Cairo, and the unrivalled interest of
the locality. Twice its owner has had to treble
its size, and now it contains eighty bedrooms, a
dining-room 40 M 80 ft., another 40 Y 27 ft, smaller
dining-rooms, drawing and reading-rooms, full.
sized English billiard-tal/es, an ice-room, studio
for artists, etc. There is a Jenning‘s lavatory, and
the earth-closets are in a building disconnected
from the hotel. There are six f1sed baths, hot and
cold, and the bath and sink water is used to irrigate
the garden; also assvimn1iug-bath, 80 X '25 ft. The
drinking-water is obtained from wells in the desert,

fifty feet deep, and is conducted through filiering-
tanks to the hotel. An English medical man is
resident during the season, and his colleagues in
Cairo can also be summoned by telephone or
donkey-messenger. Among other things provided
for the comfort of English visitors are a steam-
laundry, smoking-rooms, magazines and 12ews-
papers, and stabling for thirtytwo horses. For
amusements there are an archery ground and
lawn-tennis court, golf-links, and the makings of
a polo and cricket ground. There are ponies,
camels, and donkeys to ride, traps to hire, and
good quail and duek-sshoobing. A four-in-hand
coach is to drive daily from Cairo during the
season, November to April. Price 12s. to 14s. a
day, with no extras.

During the last two winters I have sent many
patients to stay at this hotel, and have been much
pleased with their progress. It is also very useful
for those in Cairo who wish to drive out for luncheon
or afternoon tea in the winter, or for dinner upon
moonlit nights in the warmer weather. The air
is so pure and dry that it cannot be praised too
highly, but it must be remembered that of the
three desert spots recommended near Cairo, none
are so warm as Luxor; but, on the other hand,
they are invaluable to those who do not want the
fatigue and expense of a voyage up the Nile. The

temperature of all three resorts, Helouan, Pyramids,
and Matariyeh, may he taken as the same as that
given for Cairo, with the diifei.enee of a little less
humidity in their favour. As in Cairo, there is a
great fall in temperature soon after the sun has
set, and invalids must either be indoors or provided
with wraps, but fortunately there is no danger of
malaria.

Sight-sccz'ug.~Ahout forty years ago, when
Lepsius visited the Pyramids, and had his encamp-
ment partly washed away by a fieree rain-storm,
there were no less than sixty-five Pyramids on the
plateau of Ghizeh; but now there are only nine
recognized, mid of these visitors pay homage to
the three largest. I have so often been summoned
to attend patients with weak hearts who have
suffered after rapidly ascending the Great Pyramid,
that i am constrained to warn all those who are
elderly and delicate from attemptingit. The climb
is a dilllcult one of at least twenty or thirty minutes,
and the only satisfaction to be gained is ubeauiiful
view from the summit. The staff on the top of
this Pyramid dates from the transit of Venus
expedition of 1874,

There are always Bedouins who will be delighted
for :1. small sum to ascend one or both Pyramids
in an incredibly short time, and a patient of mine
with a weak heart was induced last winter after

dinner to imitate the performance. Be won his
wager, and also a week's fright and rest in bed.
The descent from the Pyramid is more unpleasant .
to most people than the being hauled up.

The visit to theinterior is quite worth the fatigue
to those who are fairly strong, because the traveller
then gets an accurate idea of what these gigantic
tombs were intended for.

The best way to avoid all altercation with the
Bedouins, who are pleasant, amiable, and gentle-
manly, with an eye fired on the main chance, is
to let them choose one of their number to take
charge of the party, and to receive all the hack-
sheesh. It will then be to his interest to protect
the party from all his brethren; and it may be
said generally that if any difficulty arises it is
the fault of the traveller.

The road up the Pyramid hill was repaired in
1881 from chips of the easing of the Great Pyramid;
and, in addition to many other thefts during several
ages, the Sultan Hassam mosque is said to have
been built in AD. 1056, from the stones of the
Great Pyramid. It seems to have been less trouble
for Cairo architects to take their stone from
Memphis and the Pyramids than to have it hewn
afresh from the quarries which originally supplied
it, and were actually nearer to Cairo.

The Pyramid-builders were masters of the art


Suburbs of Cairo. 103

of cementing. In the Great Pyramid there are
2,300,000 stones, and blocks weighing about six-
teen tons have vertical joints only one-fiftieth of an
inch thick in the easing. Fancy this for thirteen
acres of surface, and there are tens of thousands
of easing stones, none less than one ton in weight I

The granite Temple is connected with the Second
Pyramid by a causeway, and, to rightly understand
the Pyramids, it should be remembered that each
one had a temple on its east where the dead and
deified king was worshipped, just as humbler folk
worshipped their ancestors in their family tombs.

The guidebooks tell of most of the tombs to be
seen here, but visitors often neglect to see the
galleries of the workmen, which are rather interest-
ing. There are altogether ninety-one galleries,
ol, ft. wide, and 7 ft. high, with an aggregate of
ll, mile of length.

The Sphinx, as the largest and perhaps the oldest
sculptured figure in the world, is fascinating to all;
but those who wish to worship unrestrainedly,
must go there with a carefully chosen party by
moonlight. Perhaps the best view of it is obtained
from the steps facing it, which is probably the spot
chosen by the original worshippers of the god. As
visitors sometimes forget the sex of the Sphinx,
1 may remind them that his beard, broken in
pieces, is now in the British Museum.


104 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Near the Third Pyramid there are the ruins of a
Graeo-Roman village.

Besides the ride to Sakkfuah, excursions may be
made to the Pyramid of Abu Roash, or to a petrified
forest seven miles away.

MATARIYEH.

Five miles to the north-east of Cairo, and now
connected with it by train and telephone, is the
village of Matariyeh, which has lately become a
popular suburb among some of the European and
native residents.

On Easter Monday, 1889, which is a. national
holiday in Egypt, 19,000 people were conveyed to
it by train. At other times it is dull and empty,
though two small hotels have lately sprung up,
besides restaurants and many private villas. There
is some talk of building an English hotel near the
plain where, in A.D. 1517, the battle of Heliopolis
made the Turks masters of Egypt, and where
Kleher regained Cairo for a short time in 1800.
The attractions offered to the guests would be
camel-riding in the desert to Abbassiyeh, which was
a suburb built in 1849 to please the Bedouin sheiks
who deelined to enter the city of Abbas, the then
Khedive, or to the ostriehdarm and orange-groves
in the neighbourhood. Then there are the petri-

fled forest; the Virgin’s Tree, which was planted in
1672; the oldest Obelisk in Egypt, and the mounds
which represent Heliopolis, the celebrated town
where Joseph married the high p1iesi's daughter,
where Moses became learned in the wisdom of the
Egyptians, where Jeremiah wrote his Lamenta-
tions, and where Plato pondered over the new
doctrine of the immortality of the soul.

CHAPTER WI.
VOYAGE UP THE NILE.

THE traveller who wishes to visit Luxor, Thebes,
Philae, or Abu Simbel, is dependent upon the great
water-way of Egypt. He may go up all the way
by steamer or by Ghabiyeh, or he may, if he
chooses, save himself 280 miles by baking, the train
from Cairo to Assiout. In 1891, the Upper Egypt
railway Will have a station in Cairo itself, and will
be pushed on to Girgeh, ninety-two miles south,
so that patients will be able to leave Cairo one
morning and sleep in Luxor the second night. But
at present we are dependent on a railway station
three miles outside Cairo, and a tiresome dusty
journey of eleven hours is necessary to reach
Assiout. Moreover, the invalid has the double
disadvantage of starting from Cairo before the day
is warmed by the sun, and of reaching Assiout
after sunset. On the other hand, he has the
advantage of getting without delay into the warmer
latitude, and of escaping all risk of cold and


Voyage up the Nile. 107

draught on the river north of Assiout. Each
individual case must be settled upon its own
merits, and care taken to secure the minimum
cold and fatigue.

There are many people who make the Nile trip
without leaving their steamer or dairabiyeh, and
some even make two steamer trips up the Nile in
one winter. cook's steamers are made as comfort-
able as possible, and he does everything he can
to minimize the draught and cold for delicate
passengers. His firm has what is almost a com-
plete monopoly of the river traffic south of Cairo,
and, as some 1500 visitors proceeded up the Nile
in the winter of 1888-0, those intending to do so
would be wise to secure accommodation in advance.

Four large steamers, luxuriously fitted up, ply
between Cairo and Assouan between November and
March, and on each of them there are two rooms
nine 01' ten feet high specially reserved for invalids
who are obliged to keep their cabins until they
reach the universal sunshine of Luxor. The
ordinary cabins have one or two berths, and convey
fifty first-elass passengers, and are provided with
electric bells, and windows protected by glass,
Yenetians, and wire gauze. There are also ladies'
saloons, piano, and library, and a plentiful supply
of fresh food of all kinds.

Every steamer, large and small, carries an


108 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

English doctor, whose services are seldom required;
a huge medicine-chcst; a European manager; and
a dmgoman, who arranges the details of the sight-
seeing.

The whole trip from Cairo to Assouan and back
to Cairo in these steamers takes three weeks; or it
may be arranged that the traveller shall break his
journey for a long 01' short time at Luxor OI' else-
where. For those who desire to visit all the
temples and to devote a longer time to their study,
a special steamer makes the trip in four weeks
instead of three, and is provided with perfect
accommodation for tweniy-five passengers. The
length of the smallest of these steamers is 160 ft. ;
the breadth, 20 ft. ; the horse-power, 275; and the
usual speed, eleven miles an hour.

But it has been found that there are many who
cannot afford the time OI' the expense for the three
weeks' trip, and therefore some cheap express
steamers have been constructed to ply twice a
week between Assiout and Assouan, so that tourists
can go from Cairo to the First Cataract and back
in fourteen days for £25, including a stay of four
days at Luxor; ,4 they may go to Luxor and
back for £20 in eleven days, four of which can be
devoted to seeing Thebes and Karnak. These
cheaper steamers carry thirty ficsst-class passengers,
and are very useful for those invalids who wish to

get quickly and inexpensively io the hotels at
Luxor. Special facilities are made on route for
postal and telegraphic communication with Cairo
and with Europe.

Messrs. Cook are always able to provide families
or shooting-partios with dahabiyehs and competent
clragomans, or these may be engaged from many
native owners.

The voyage up the Nile was formerly reserved
for the richest English and Americans, but I have
shown that it is now made easy for any one who
wishes to spend £100 in pursuit of health or
pleasure. There are many who are not sufficiently
gregarious to Wish to make a pleasure-trip with a
number of strangers, and to see the sights at
a fired time and within a fixed period, and, more-
over, have not to consider the economy of time or
money. To them the peaceful life of a. dahabiyeh
has many attractions: their party is complete in
itself,- they have a supply of books, sketching-
materials, shooting necessaries and patience; and
a dragoman who will procure for them every day a
fresh supply of milk, meat, vegetables, fruit,
poultry, and eggs. They will be dependent on
their cook for bread, and on various tins for butter,
jam, bacon, biscuits, etc. Theyhad better provide
their own wine, curtains for dmughty windows,
and oleek-ehairs. They may either start in their

dahabiyeh from Cairo, or send it up to Rodah or
Assiout and there join it by train, 01', best of all,
engage a steamer to tow them at least as far as
Assiout. This is a very delightful way of travelling,
but the number of tow steamers is limited, and the
price often prohibitive. The ordinary Ghabiyeb,
in going up stream against a current of three miles
an hour, is quite dependent on wind. Fortunately
the prevailing wind is from the north, the sails
are large, and the crew are clever to take all
advantage of it. It will take about two months to
get to the First Cataract and back, and three
months to go from Cairo to the Second Cataract
and back, and the cost for a party of four is about
tsvenby-fisre shillings Per head per day.

There ought to be no mosquitoes on the Nile, or
other. biting insects, but flies are often a great
trouble, and require Whisks, papers, and traps. It
is very cold at night, and ulsters, rugs, and other
warm wraps are necessary.

Temperature and climate on the Nile in winter.--
Dr. Patterson' gives an analysis for October, of
six daily observations during a voyage from Cairo
to Luxor and back. The thermometer varied from
68° at 7 mm. to 825° at 3 p.m., the total mean
of the month being 76° Falun, and no rain fell
during the time.

in 1888, in the dnhabiyeh saloon, 50 per cent.,
with a, range from 43 to 78. The thermometer is
highest at 3 p.111. and lowest between midnight
and 7 mm. The air is driest in the afternoon,
and dampest in the early morning. Dr. F. S.
Worthington has also given me some careful daily
readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and a
few miles to its south. The barometer average
(corrected for sea-level) was 30'10; in the dnhn-
biyeh saloon the average maximum temperature

was (38°, and the minimum 5T30; in the bed-room
the figures were 66'5° and 57°; and the average
minimum on deck was 43°. Nine days were
cloudy and rather cold; the remainder were
bright, fresh, and fine.

In January, Patterson gives the early morning
temperature on deck as 50°; the maximum, G4'5°;
and the mean, 56°. He notes that there was one
shower of rain, and that the average daily range
of the thermometer was from 4° to T' Fahr.
Dr. Worthington found that in January, 1889,
between a, point south of Cairo and another south
of Girgheh, the barometer average was 30'17 ; the
dallabiyeh saloon temperature showed a maximum
of (50W', and a. minimum of 50'7°, with {L deck
minimum of 41W'. He recorded 'a south wind on
sixteen days, north wind twelve days, rain on two
days, and fog early in the morning on two other
occasions, all the other days being bright and fine.
Dr. T. D. Savill spent January, 1888, in one of
cook's steamers, travelling from Cairo to Wady
Halfa and back, and kindly took some notes for
me. His thermometers Were hung below the
awning where the passengers sit by day. He
found the average maximum 703", and the absolute
maximum 77° (above Assouan); the average
minimum 47S'', and the absolute minimum 40''
one night at Luxor. On eighteen different nights

the temperature fell below 50°, and the average
mean (mean of means) was GO''. He also occa-
sionally tested the temperature an hour before
and zm hour after sunset; the average fall of six
evenings was y Fahr. The usual wind was
northerly, light to fresh. There were four days
on which showers of rain fell, all south of Assonan;
eight other days which were a little cloudy; and
the remainder had perfect sunshine. The average
humidity was (32 per cent, five times it was above
80, and the driest day it was only 3-1.

In February, Patterson gives a mean temperature
of 63°, and a maximum of only 70°, with the
record of one rain-shower, and an average range
of the month from 4° to I' Fahr. He speaks,
however, of one strange day when the thermometer
at 7 mm. marked 44°, and rose at 2 p.111. to 7(F,
the solar temperature at that time being 135°, and
at sunset the thermometer fell again (jo in half an
hour. Dr. Worthing/on spent February, 1889,
between Keneh and Assouan, and registered an
average barometer of 30"23, {Lu average maximum

Savill was travelling from Cairo to Wady Halfa,
back again almost as far as Cairo, and then once
more up the river to Luxor. His average maximum
was 808°, and he reached his highest, 05°, one
day above Luxor. His average minimum was
55S'', and the lowest attained was 45°, there being
five night-readings below 50°. The average mean
of the month was 6r50. The temperature as
tested one hour before and one hour after sunset
showed an average fall of fy(Y' Fahr. The wind
was northerly and light. On two days showers
fell at Luxor, three other days were partially
cloudy, but the remainder were sunny all day.
The humidity ranged from 24 to 80, and the
months average was 495 per cent.

For March, Patterson’s average is GG'8°, and
his maximum only 71W', with the record of a
thunderstorm two days in succession in one year.
On two days of warm south winds he found the
temperature differing 21° and 20° between 7 a.m.
and midday, and the average range of the month
a little higher than in February. The warmth of
the Nile water taken at various times and places
Was (U'. Dr. Worthington drifted down the Nile
from Assouan to Assiout in March, 1889, and
recorded as barometer average, 30SI ; as maximum
saloon temperature, 82°; and as minimum average
of saloon, 614°, and of deck, 55W'. The wind was


Voyage up the Nile, 115

from the north twenty-two days, and from the
south five days, and was entered as light every
day excepting on nine occasions, when it was
strong breeze or moderate gale. No rain was
noted. During the first half of March, 1888, Dr.
Savill accompanied a Cook’s steamer from Luxor
to Assouan and back again to Cairo by river, to
bring back the last of the visitors from Luxor.
The average maximum temperature under the
awnings was 84°, and the highest point 100° was
reached at Assouau. The average minimum was
51t', and the lowest recorded was 44", there being
four readings at night below 50°. The average
mean was (578°. The temperature before and
after sunset showed a fall of 4° Fahr. The wind
was northerly and strong. There was no rain,
one clay was cloudy, the others sunny, and the
humidity of the air very much less than in
February.

April is not tt month which many people spend
on the river, on account of the increasing heat and
the liability to dust-storms.

Dr. Worthington’s observations were made
during the former half of the month between
Minieh and Cairo, and during the latter half on
the same dnhabiyeh at Cairo. The barometer
remained at 30'15; the saloon maximum tempera-
ture averaged 817°, and the average minimum


116 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

was 61° in the saloon and 53° on deck. The wind
was northerly or north-west, and on eight days
strong.

Dr. Worthington’s records for May were still
on the dahabiyeh at Cairo, during weather which
most people found unpleasantly hot. His baro-
meter average was 30'26; the maximum saloon
average was 86'5°, and the average minimum heat
was 67‘6° in the saloon and 64'7" on deck. Wind
was north-west, north-east, and north. There were
three scorching hot days, and on the evening of
the 23rd there was a little rain.

Places of interest-The following sights can be
easily visited during the voyage up the Nile:
Sakluirah, Maydoum Pyramid, sugar-factories,
grottoes of Beni Hassan, Tel-el-Amarna, Assiout,
Ekhmeem where there has been a recent find ot
antiquities, Abydos, Denderah, Luxor, Karnak,
Thebes, Esneh, Edfu, Silsileh, Komombo, Assouan,
Elephantine Island, and Philae.

There are many who wish to go higher than the
First Cataract and to see the wonders of Ealabsheh,
Abu Simbel, and Wady Halfa ; but for this, special
arrangements are necessary both by steamer and
by dahahiyeh.

The chief monuments of the Nile are south of
Assiout, so that no invalid who has seen Sakkérah
while in Cairo need grudge the few remaining


Voyage up the Nile. 117

sights which he will miss by taking train to
Assiout.

Birds ofthe A'ile.-1 have already said that there
is excellent shooting during the winter months,
but to enjoy this thoroughly the sportsman must
be on a dahabiyel1, and not tied to time. There is
a great variety of duel: and small and large waders,
and any number of grain-eating birds and insect-
devourers. Ornithologists interested in collecting
birds will find a larger range of hawk species up
the Nile than in almost any other country. A
complete list of birds is too long for insertion
here, but a. traveller going to Assouan at the
beginning of the year is certain, among others,
to meet with the following-Griffon vulture and
Egyptian vulture, imperial eagle, spotted eagle,
rock pigeon, Egyptian turtle-dovc, chiffchaff, white-
winged chat, kestrel, lesser Kestrel, seeps owl,
Egyptian eagle owl, Egyptian goose, common teal,
parasitic kite, Oriental chimney swallow, pale "rag

eron is becoming more and more popular every
winter, and as the season is a. short one patients
have hardly time to get tired of its monotony. A
bright sunny sky, combined with healthy outdoor
exercise and interesting sights to visit, is a great
help towards cheerfulness, and to this we may
add a dry bracing climate, and freedom from rain
and all atmospheric impurities.

Dr. Patterson long ago described the Egyptian
climate as possessing the warmth of Madeira,
without its terrible damp and relaxing infiuenee.
The days for sending consumptive patients to hot,
damp climates are almost at an end. In writing
of Luxor I cannot do better than supplement Dr.
1Iaelean's' pamphlet, Which appeared after his
death, and contained his own experiences as an
invalid during the winters oi 1877-8-0.

* " Hints " Invalids and Travellers, with Observations on the
Climate of Luxor mid Egypt." 1881.


120 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Luxor is a large village of 4000 natives, is 450
miles south of Cairo, and must be reached from
Cairo or Assiout by steamer or dahabiyeh.

Season.--Those who wish to make the voyage up
the Nile in a dahabiyeh, and then live in it at or
near Luxor, should start from Cairo at the end of
November, because they will then have a doligl1tful
summer trip without cold win'ds. After the middle
of December the north wind, which is so pleasant on
land, is apt to be piereingly cold for invalids on the
river, and requires the use of thick clothes and rugs.
Invalids going up in a steamer from Cairo should
leave not later than the third week of December,
because they will thus avoid the rain and cloudi-
ness to which Cairo is then liable. Lastly, those
patients who leave Cairo later than Christmas Day
should shorten the Nile trip by taking train to
Assiout, or must be content to be kept well out of
harm's way on the river north of that town. At
Assiout they will find a, fair hotel and some English
officials.

Patients begin to leave Luxor at any time after
the middle of February, and very few are up the
river as late as the middle of April.

The English doctor is in residence at Luxor
Hotel from the middle of December to the end of
March, and there is now also an English chaplain.
During the whole season there are, of course, con-


Luxor-Aswan. 121

stant relays of visitors, who stop for a few days on
the way up and down the Nile.

Irotels.--There are two good hotels, the better of
which is kept by one of Messrs. Cook’s agents. It
was opened at the end of 1877, and, though it has
been constantly enlarged, it is always full daring
the season, and rooms must therefore be engaged
in advance. There is accommodation for about
a hundred visitors, and at the Kama]; Hotel for
about half that number. Unti11888 most of the
Luxor Hotel rooms were built in a single line from
north to south, so as to receive full benefit of
morning and afternoon sun, and the rooms were
on two floors, the ground floor being raised four
steps above the ground. The walls are purposely
built of rough bricks of great thickness, so that
they can be kept cool on hot days, and will retain
their heat during winter nights. But I found that
invalids had to go into the open air to get from
their bedroom or sitting-room to the table rl'luhe,
and the ever-willing proprietor only required to
have this disadvantage pointed out to him, to con-
struct a large dining-room, two drawing-rooms, and
over these bedrooms with a central passage, Which
allow delicate Visitors to ascend without meeting
the night air. Healthy visitors find 110 incon-
venience from occupying the older rooms. Electric
bells have been set up, and etu0-closets with good


122 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

ventilation have been renewed. The hotel stands
in a beautiful garden of sweet-smelling plants, and
is distant about 350 yards from the Nile. Excellent
milk and other provisions can be obtained. There
are no mosquitoes or sasl-flies, but often a plague
of Louse-flies. The dogs at night have sometimes
been a nuisance, but they can be destroyed by
the police if proper representation is made, either
locally or to Cairo.

Drinking-wad is taken as usual from the Nile
above the watering-place of the town, and then
filtered in the ordinary way with big porous jars.

Clothing should be as for summer and autumn
in the south of England. Flannel suits supple-
mented by a, belt are very useful for both sexes by
day and night. Ladies should avoid black dresses
on account of the all-pervading sand, and they
will require wash-leather " other gloves for donkey-
riding. Sun-hats will he wanted in February and
March.

Clivoate.--Tlae invalid who seriously wishes to
get full benefit from his stay will not be out before
10 mm. or after sunset, and on cold days this
period should be shortened. It cannot too often
be repeated that the night air is very cold in com-
parison to that of the Gy, and also that whenever
the temperature in Egypt is lower than 60° Fahr.
it seems unpleasantly cool. But the healthy


I,uxor-A ssouan. 123

visitor may be out all day long, and the delicate
one should be abroad as much as possible during
thevwarm hours.

Luxor is on the right bank of the Nile, 292 feet
above the level of the sea, in latitude 25'' " N.,
an'd longitude yy " E. Immediately opposite
and lying at {L lower level, is the great plain of
Thebes, stretching to the Libyan hills of lime-
stone. '
Reference to Table V. shows that the corrected
readings of the barometer (Fortin's) are always
low and very steady till the hot weather begins.
During November and December they were taken
daily at 11.30 mm; and during the other three
months, three times a day, at f) adn., 3 p.1n., and
6 p.111.

The absolute maximum temperature for Novem-
ber was 94° on the 4th; for December, 77°; for
January, Maclean once registered 83°; for Feb-
ruary, 80'' and 86°; and at the end of March the
heat reaches even 110”, according to the same
observer. The thermometers were hung in a
north verandah, four feet from the ground, two
feet from a wall, and protected from the wind. Of
the solar temperatures in vacuo, the highest I
find recorded are 164° on November 3, and 155"
on March 13.

But, as I have said before, the highest and

lowest temperatures are not those of chief inte-
rest to the delicate visitor. He should rather
consult the Table to see the average heat during
the day out of dodrs, and the average cold
of his bedroom by night. During the three
months When seine patients are advised to be at
Luxor rather than at Cairo-Deeember, January,
February both the daylight and bedroom tem-
peratures are always above 60°, and generally
above 63" Fahr. This is the great feature of
Lusor-a dry warmth during the very months
When it is generally so damp and warm, or damp
and cold, elsewhere. The increase in the mean
daylight temperature of February over that of
January is elf1efly due to the increase of the daily
maximum, but slightly also to the increased height
of the daily minimum temperature. The remark-
able uniformity of the bedroom temperature is
worth noticing, and can be explained as follows.
The walls, it may be remembered, me very thick,
and built of crude bricks, and these, while absorb,
ing a great deal of heat during the day, keep the
extreme heat out of the room; but at night, when
radiation commences, they part with their ac-
quired surplus heat before the bedroom air can
approach the temperature of the external air. By
EL little judicious management, opening windows
to catch the sun, and shutting them again at

 


126 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

sunset, the invalid can easily avoid all cold air,
and the risks of a sudden drop of the thermometer.
In March it will often be necessary to pursue the
opposite tactics, and shut windows during the
greatest heat of the day, to keep the bedroom from
getting too hot. This was not done in March,
1878, and consequently the bedroom average
jumped up to over 77''. Dr. Maclean made some
further experiments, to show that the lowest tem-
perature in the bedroom was usually 20° higher
than the lowest temperature in the shade, and
that a low bedroom heat depends chiefly on the
presence of a low shade minimum.

The daily range of the thermometer is always
very great, as one would expect in an inland dry
country of the latitude of Luxor. The tempera-
ture falls at night, in consequence of the rapid
radiation of heat which obtains under a cloudless
sky. But the range of maximum heat from one
day to another, for the first three months of the
year, is 3C', 'W', 3'8", showing that during the
portion of the twenty-four hours available for
the invalid the climate is remarkably equal.

The humidity is EL good deal lower than that of
Cairo, being 16'5 per cent. less in January, 15 less
in February, and 11 less in March. The extremes
in January, 1878, at Luxor, were 74 and 33; in
February, 67 and 27 ; and in March the maximum


Luaor-Awouart. 127

moisture only reached 60, while the minimum fell
to 21 per cent.

Ruin is indeed rare at Luxor, for there was none
in November and December, 1881, and this is by
no means unusual. In January, 1882, there was
none; but in 1878 there was one shower, and
another in January 1888. In the month of
February, 1878, there was a shower, another in
1882, again in 1887, and three minutes' rain was
recorded by Dr. Boase in 1888.

In 1878, 1882, and 1888, no rain was noted in
March. There would thus seem to be only two or
three days in the year when rain falls at Luxor.
Thunder and lightning are rarer still.

The amount of cloud is very little in the year,
but the sky was noted as being completely over-
east four times in January, once in February, and
three times in March.

The amount 0 ozone was estimated by noting,
the depth of the staining produced in a piece of
paper prepared with iodide of potassium and
starch, after it had been exposed to the air in a.
double metallic gauze cage. Dr. Maclean pointed
out that when the barometer stood high, and the
temperature not great, the largest amounts of 0f50110
were present, while little ozone was indicated with
a low barometer on a hot day.

The wind's maximum force was 4 in January,


128 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

3 in February, and only 2 in March. The dust-
storms are often troublesome, though not numerous.
A moderate breeze some four or five times a month
carries with it a great quantity of dust, and this
becomes more frequent after February.

It should be hardly necessary to say that no
patients with advanced phthisis ought to be sent
to winter at Luxor ; neither should any of those
who require to be surrounded With all modern
luxuries and the treasures of culinary art. Patients
with weak hearts and enlarged congested livers
would be better in Cairo. Some few people who
cannot, or will not, ride the ass of the country,
have had themselves carried in litters to see the
sights of the neighbourhood.

Amusements.- Unlimited donkey-riding and
sketching are always to be had. The curio-lover
may collect many authentic and a few manu-
factured antiquities; the sportsman can get good
quail and cluek-shooiing with the help of a guide,
and he may, if he chooses, shoot birds for a. col-
lection, jaekals, and oeeasionally hyasnas. There
is not much fishing or boating, but excellent bath-
ing, though the swimmer must be warned that
the current is often ssvift-three miles an hour-.
and the banks are dangerously precipitate cliffs.

There are good postal and telegraph arrange-
ments. There are enough local officials to provide


Ltcror-Assouau. 129

an amusement committee, if the visitors have re-
course to hun.

Siyltt-seeiny.-0lose to the village of Luxor and
its hotels are the two Luxor Temples, and a
pleasant walk along the Avenue of Sphinxes takes
us to the well-known wonders of Karnak. 0n the
opposite side of the Nile are the Temples of lla.
meses I. and IL, the Rameseum, the Colossi of the
Eighteenth Dynasty, the Temples of Rameses IH.,
Thothmcs HL, beautifully preserved sculptures,
the Tombs of the Kings and other humblcr folk, of
the Queens, and lastly of hundreds of early Chris-
tians. All these remains, and many more of
Thebes and its necropolis, contrive to make sunny
Luxor a very delightful and interesting winter
retreat.

A society, with its lseaHuarters in London, has
just been started for the preservation of ancient
monuments in Egypt. An estimate of the cost of
the most necessary work, such as clearng away
rubbish, strengthening pillars, draining, off water,
etc., shows that £2055 is wanted for Luxor, £3140
for Karnak, and £3400 for Thebes, Esneh, and Edfu.
It is to be hoped that money will soon be forth-
coming to preserve all temples from the depreda-
tion of time, thieves, and tourists.

E

ASSOUAN.

There is no hotel as yet at the First Cataract,
but we ought soon to see one built, for winter
residents at Luxor would find it an agreeable
change to go now and then to Assouan; and
Shellal, opposite the island of Philm, has been re-
commended as a perfect aanaborium by Dr. Abbate
Pasha.

Assouan is 133 miles higher up the river than
Luxor-that is, 583 miles south of Cairo. The
temple of Esueh is only 35 miles from Luxor, and
Edfu temple is half-way to Assouan; then, 26 miles
further on, we come to the sights of Silsileh, and
then the temple of Kom Ombo, a few miles north
of Assouan.

Assouan has a varied native population of about
9000, and is well guarded by forts, and by 2000
Egyptian troops under English offieers.

Visitors will be interested in the granite quarries,
rocks of schist, granite, and basalt, Sir F. Gren-
fell's tombs, Elephantiue Island, the shooting of
the cataract, and the lovely temple on the Island
of Philm.

Temperature-No regular meteorological records
have been taken at Assouan, but the Army Medical
Staff took a few notes during the Nile expedition

No barometrical readings were taken. The ob-
servations were made twice daily at 9 a.m. and
3 p.m., and show a temperature record about
5° Fahr. higher than at Luxor. The air is said
to be more free of dust-storms than at Luxor, and
by some the winter climate is preferred.

Voyage to Second Cataraet.--It is not now pos-
sible to go beyond Wady Halfa, but those who
wish to see the forts there and the Temple of Abu
Simbel can do so by spending three extra weeks
in a dahabiyeh, or one week in a. steamer. It is
210 miles from Phila, to Wady Iralfa.

Defences of Eyypt.--Uany visitors, elaiefly Ameri-
cans, were deterred from coming to Egypt in the
winter of 1888-0, because of the Sundanese raids


132 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

outside the town of Suakin. It may therefore be
wise to state exactly what is the disposition of the
troops which have to defend Egypt and its visitors
from any hypothetical hordes of invading dervishes. .
Suahin is a port on the Red Sea, Which by a fast-
sailing steamer can only be reached in eight days
from Cairo. It is well fortified and garrisona1 by
3000 Egyptian and black soldiers, ofiieered by the
British army, who are well able to repel any
advances of the Soudanese, and can, if necessary,
be strengthened by English troops.

At Wady Halfa, Which is eight hundred miles
from Cairo, and separated from it by a distance
which can only be traversed in ten days by the
fastest steamers, there are more than 3000 Egyptian
and black soldiers, again commanded by English-
men. There are also many strong forts, for the
English policy is to act entirely on the defensive
until the raids of the Soudanese become so impu-
dent that it is absolutely necessary to chastise
them, as in August, 1889. At Assouan, I have
already said, there are forts manned by 2000 of
the Egyptian army. In Cairo and Alexandria
there are 3000 English soldiers of all branches of
the service, who can be moved to any spot should
danger threaten, and can be reinforced from Malta,
Gibraltar, Cyprus, or from troops passing through
the Suez Canal to or from India. The Soudanese


Luror-Assmuvi. 133

are likely to remain unsettled, but I hope I have
said enough to show that they will not be allowed
to do more than occasionally harass the frontier
stations of Egypt.

In conclusion, I have only to add that the
Egyptian police is recruited from the 'army, and
it again is offieered by the English, and ample
provision exists for preventing any internal dis..
turbance among one of the most peaceful and least
criminal populations of the world.

CHAPTER IX.
uExtNmua-Ra1rLEm

ALEXANDRIA once possessed a great reputation for
sah1brity, and was much recommended by the
ancient physicians for diseases of the chest. But
the modern city is no favourite with invalids, and
tourists, obliged to use it as {L port of entry, hurry
on to Cairo because they can find nothing of sight-
seeing to detain them. During the early months
of the year Alexandria is subject to rain, gales,
and cold, but in April the weather is often pleasanter
than in Cairo, and it is at this time that iuvalids
for whom Europe is not yet warm enough are
recommended to stay, not in Alexandria itself, but
in the suburb of Ramleh near by. They will find
refreshing sea-breezes, instead of the liability to
kluunseen wind in Cairo, a temperature which is
not too high, and a degree of humidity which is
not excessive. The days are bright and sunny,
and the nights not too cold. In the town of
Alexandria there are two first-elass hotels, several

smaller ones, three or four "pensions," and a

and streets of European shops. Very little trace
of the bombardment and fire of 1882 remains, and
since £4,000,000 of indemnity were paid by the
Egyptian Government, building has been stimu-
lated to such an extent that there are many now
houses and shops which cannot find a tenant.

The zratcr-supply of the town is excellent, and is
in the hands of an English company, which has a
monopoly for ever, and is represented on the spot
by an energetic and highly intelligent English
civil engineer. The water is obtained from the
Mahmoudieh canal, which branches off the Nile at
Atfeh; but if, during low Nile, there is any danger
of the river at Atfeh becoming brackish, the supply
is taken from higher up the Nile near Cairo. The
banks of the canal are inspected by watchmen, to

prevent natives from throwing carcasses or empty-
ing drains into it, and they also flush the canal
every ten days with 500,000 tons of Nile water.

At high Nile the water is so muddy that it is
necessary to mix with it alum and iron before it
is pumped into the filter-beds. Also if chemical
analysis shows an abnormal percentage of organic
matter, permanganate of soda is mixed with the
water before it reaches the filter-beds. There are
three filter-beds, each 2400 yards square, and
covered with wood. The beds are 2 ft. (Sin. deep,
and consist of sand, Which is brought from the
sea-shore near Damietta, and of four different sizes
of gravel, laid on bricks, and BO placed as to
make a ready communication between the lower
layers and the pumps for cleansing purposes. The
sand is well washed in water, and the beds cleaned
every nine days. From the filter-beds the water
is pumped into a reservoir, and thence into Alex-
andria, at the rate of 26,000 cubic metres a day.

Though the water-supply is so well cared for,
the drainage of Alexandria cannot be commended.
Since 1871 the streets of the town have been
paved, like Naples, with slabs of lava from Catania,
and the drains, originally laid down by the Paving
Commission for storm-water, have been used as
overflows for the eesspools under the houses. The
culverts run out to tho sea-shore, but some are

built with an insufficient fall, and others ventilate
untmpped into the streets, accounting for many
of the unpleasant odours of the town. The cess-
pools not running into these culverts are emptied
by carts on the sea-shore near the town.

Ramleh has a station of its own (Sidi Gabir)

carriages are required to meet the traveller there
they must be previously ordered from Alexandria.
With the exception of a, few private carriages, life
at Ramleh is carried on 011 donkey-back. During
the daytime trains run every hour 01' half-hour
from Alexandria to the seven stations, which are
only about halfa mile apart. Each house stands
proudly in its own grounds, and varies in character
from a limestone shanty to a pretentious two-
storied chtlet. The prevailing Wind blows refresh
ingly from the sea; there are miles of desert to
explore on the land side, pretty gardens to the
straggling, houses, and, besides representatives of
Greece and many other nations, a colony of Eng-
lish ofruials and merchants who are famous for
their hospitality and their lmvn-teimis parties.

walls of merchant princes are still to be seen
patched Bedouin tents, whose mysterious inmates
are a relic of the Arabs who levied blackmail on
the first English settlers, and professed to keep the
rest of their tribesmen at a distance.

For hotels, there are thirty~two bedrooms at San
Stefano, a highly commended Beau Sejour, and two
smaller hotels, besides an English private boarding-
house. San Stefano also embraces clubrooms,
excellent swimmiug-baths for both sexes, electric-
lighting, a European string-band, weekly afternoon
dances for children, evening parties for adults,
etc. The height of the season is from June 15
to October 15, but the hotel is open earlier in the
year.

Some Creek doctors are resident in Ramleh, and
there is now a chemist; but most residents prefer
to get their medical help direct from Alexandria.
There is a Greek church and an Italian Catholic;
while in Alexandria, there are Church of England,
Church of Scotland, German and French Pro,
testaut, Roman Catholic, and many other places of
worship.

The conservancy arrangements are of too primi-
tive a character. Many English houses are pro-
vided with earth-closets; the rest have eesspools
draining away into the porous sand. Up till now

Ramleh has been a wonderfully healthy spot;
but the day will come when the subsoil Will be
saturated with all the water used for the gardens,
baths, and kitchens, and some scheme of drainage
will be necessary.

The water-supply is pumped straight from the
canal of the Alexandria Company, unfiltered, to
a reservoir, and thence to Ramleh at the rate
of 12,000 cubic metres a day. For use in the
house, it is then filtered through native porous
jars. The greater part of the water is of course
used for the private gardens, where, besides many
English flowers and fruits, one sees oleanders,
point-settias, hibiscus, bougainvillia, begonia trees,
indiarubber trees towering almost as high as the
palms, and grapes, bananas, oranges, figs, and
melons. The desert abounds in a great variety of
small flowers; and one of the features of this
neighbourhood is the ice-plant (Jlesembryauthemunr
cristallinunz). Altogether the botanist Will find
more than two hundred specimens of interest in
and near Ramleh, while the sea-coast is covered
with beautiful shells.

many as fifteen lawn-tennis courts, a book-elub,
and even a race meeting during two days in June.
There are paper chases on ponies and donkeys, and

the English regiment quartered in Alexandria vies
with the naval and civilian population. Needless
to say, there are many hospitable evening parties,
and, as the weather gets warmer,moon1ight donkey-
excursions for the adventurous. Bathing and
fishing are always within reach; and the Alex-
andria harbour provides excellent sailing. From
November to March, plenty of duck and snipe
shooting can be had at Damietta, and within an
hour of Ramleh; and for about a mouth from the
middle of March, there is good quaiI-shooting at
Abu Homes, Damanhour, etc. From July to
October, foreign sportsmen shoot doves, hoopoes,
and other birds in the neighbourhood; and in
September the quail come again in such numbers
that one day (in 1887) two hundred and forty were
shot by a Greek resident.

faith that we can see relics of the famous city
founded 2200 years ago, and once boasting, a
muster-roll of 500,000 souls. An English sentry

Aristophanes, and Hypatia were once professors.
Where the Grand Square now stands was a long
row of obelisks and sphinxes leading to the famous
Library; but of old buildings nothing now remains
but a granite pillar or two in the native quarter of
the town. The two obelisks brought by a Caesar

from Heliopolis did indeed mark the site of the
Temple Where honours were paid to dead and
living Caesars, and where to-day the British consul
has his modern house; but, as every one knows,
they were carried away to lose their hieroglyphics
in the ungenial climates of London and New York.
The very tomb of the great Alexander is lost to us,
and has almost inspired Dr. Schliemann to a
seareh-espedition for the mausoleum of the Ptole-
mies. Pompey's Pillar, as it is erroneously called,
is only interesting to us because it is the sole relic
of the city where Antony wooed Cleopatra, and of
the time when Alexandria was the commercial
centre of the world, and Egypt was the principal
granary of Rome.

There are now only about fifteen cisterns in the
town, though in 1800 there were ten times that
number to be seen. This is only an illustration of
the destruction which has visited the city under
Arab, Turkish, and Egyptian rulers. These cisterns
are large, built under the houses, arched, and
coated with plaster.

Next in interest are the Catacombs, 01- remains
of the ancient Seeropolis, once upon IL time sur-
rounded by vineyards and gardens. They are cut

too, in a forbified Greek church, to which the English
residents used to be escorted by a Janissary for
Protestant services so late as 1840, before the
English church was built. Fort Pharos, on the
site of one of the seven wonders of the world, and
other forts still show traces of their bombardment
in 1882. Visitors are taken to see the Khedive's
yacht Mahroussa, his palace at Ras-el-Teen, the
view from the lighthouse, and from the signal-
station on Fort Napoleon, and to the drive and
gardens on the Mahmoudieh Canal, where an
Egyptian band plays twice a week. In Ramleh
itself there are the tt spouting rocks," where the sea.
1susl1es through some openings which have been
ariificially enlarged, and near by are palm groves
and curious sand-heaps (i? tumuh). In 1889, a
Roman tomb with coloured stucco interior was dis-
covered, close to some catacombs on the sea-shore.
These tombs are of pagan officers, probably from
Caesar’s camp, which was standing twenty years
ago, and demolished to build a palace, now in
its turn abandoned. Here was Nicopolis, where
Augustus defeated Antony, and where Sir Ralph
Abereromby died while beating the French under
General Menou in 1801.

The only expeditions in the neighbourhood are
to Rosetta,which is now almost deserted, and to

Aboukir, where the lake is now being drained, and
there are forts connected by torpedoes with the
bay in which Nelson fought the Battle of the Nile,
and his opponent's " boy stood on the burning
deck, whence all but he had fled." Near Aboukir
are the remains of Canopus, with granite columns
lying about, and whence, in 1888, the statue of
Rameses II. was transferred to the Boulak
Museum.

Table VII. has been compiled from statistics kindly
furnished me by ll. A. Pirona, of Alexandria, and
is based 11p011 his meteorological observations of
the nineteen years, 1870-88, for the Central Me-
teorological Institute of Vienna. His instruments
were made in Vienna, and 1veetif1ed at the Royal
Observatory there. The readings ofthe barometer
are at freezing-point, sixty-two feet above sea-level,
and were taken at 9 ann., 3 Fm., and 9 p.111. The
mean temperatures are based on records at 9 a.m.,
9 p.1n., masinva and minima, and coincide with some
observations made in 18l7-40. It will be noticed
that the prevailing wind is always straight from
the Mediterranean. The number of rainy days in
March is 4'5; in the mouth of April, only P5; and
in May the average further falls to 0"i.

These are the three months when Ramleh is at
its best, a11dean be safely recommended to those
on their way from Cairo to Europe.

APPENDIX.

IN the introductory chapter I have aiready mentioned in a
general way the diseases which are likely to be benefited by
wintering in Egypt, and now I propose to consider the
question a little more in detail, referring only to the most
common diseases which I have met with amongst health-
seekers in Cairo.

Pliii-Commencingr with pulmonary consumption, it
may be stated that cases of acute tuberculosis or acute
phthisis are not sent to Egypt as a rule, because of their
rapid fatality and because the state of the patient is so serious
as to prevent the desirability of transport. The few patients
I have seen with scrofulous phthisis associated with caries of
vertebrae, [150st abscess, or fistula in arm, have generally done
very well in Cairo, but some of them have died within a
few months after leaving for Europe.

Perhaps I may be allowed here to quote the statistics of
the iniluenee of foreign climates in consumption published
by Dr. C. T. Williams ', 251 cases were sent; to various places
in the Riviera, south of Europe, north of Africa, and At-
lantic islands. Twenty patients spent twenty-six winters
in Egypt, and furnished "by far the fiuesst land result”
of the experiment; Ci, per cent. improved, 25 per cent.
remained stationary, and only 10 per cent. became worse.
It is a. matter for congratulation that the expense of the
trip to Cairo and the ascent of the Nile is now so much
reduced that the country is thrown open to large numbers

L


146 Appendix.

of patients who have hitherto been prevented from coming.
Out of 45 cases that I have seen with unmistakable phthisis,
69 per cent. improved, 20 per cent. remained stationary, and
only 11 per cent. grew worse (including three deaths in
Egypt).

My figures are, therefore, eonfirrmUory of the results
previously obtained by Dr. Williams. The three deaths
which occurred in Egypt were cases in the last stage of
phthisis, which died soon after arrival, and of course ought
not to have been sent abroad. I can only 1:epeat--wl1at
every one knows already-that threatened cases of phthisis,
with or without a bad family history, can apparently be
prevented from developing in a pure, dry, Warm climate;
that incipient cases can be improved and perhaps cured ; that
Chronic cases can remain stationary, so that their lives are
definitely prolonged; but that advanced cases with disease
in both lungs and a temperature every night above the
normal cannot be cured by a change of climate, though
their disease may, under fortunate circumstances, be arrested,
and their days consequently may be enlivened and prolonged.

Perhaps the most satisfactory case to send abroad is the
overgrown boy or girl with winter cough, insuflieiene expan-
sion of chest, and general Iassitude. Such patients require
little or no medical treatment, gain weight and breadth of
body and mind, and return to their work at home with
healthy vigour. Next, if any cases of phthisis are to be
sent abroad, they must be either those which, though
anatomically advanced, are chronic or quiescent, or those in
the earliest possible stage.

Now, in the case of these latter, the patients and their
friends are least likely to think of the scheme, or even to
suspect the disease. It therefore rests With the medical
attendant, where he thinks fit, to order: for his patient a
continuance for: some months of an equable warm climate,
such as is provided by a summer in England, a winter in
Egypt, and a second summer in England. When a patient


Appendix. 147

in whom phthisis is suspected goes or is taken by his relatives
to a doctor to have his chest examined, it may generally bo
prophesied either that there is no ground for uneasiness, or
that the disease has already made distinct progress. Incipient
cases which gain weight and improve in other: respects
during a winter abroad, often need to be reminded that the
measure should be repeated :1. second time.

Popular young patients must often be banished from Cairo
during December and January, to desert life at the Pyramids,
or at Lusor, to protect them from themselves and their
acquaintance, and the snares of evening engagements.

Chronic cases of undoubted phthisis do Very well in Egypt,
for they improve in general health, digestion, and appetite,
and can often take cocHiver oil, which was previously im-.
possible. They are encouraged by finding that they gain a
little weight, and become rid of troublesome cough and
expectomtion. This last symptom is an important one in
Egypt, and one of the first signs of the patient’s improvement.

An ordinary phthisieal individual complains, when he tirst
reaches Cairo, of cough and expectomtion, and the stethoscope
reveals a multitude of large and small moist sounds. When
he is seen again a fortnight later, these sounds have partly
disappeared, he still coughs, but is surprised and sometimes
alarmed to notice that the expectoratior1 has suddenly
diminished. After another week or two, he reports that he
only expeetorahes the first thing in the morning ; he seldom
coughs during the day, and the stethoscope again ieonfirrns
the drying-up process which is going on in the lung, which
seems to be the direct result of dry air inhaled. This is not
so wonderful When we remember that the average winter
humidity of the Cairo air: is under sixty-six per cent. (Table
I.), while that of London is above ninety per cent. It would
be interesting to know whether the very dry air is inimical
to the life and development of the tubercle bacillus. Two
cases in which bacilli were seen in London and on arrival
in Cairo, and could not be found before leaving Cairo and


148 Appendix,

upon returning to London, are possibly ooufirrmabory of this
suspicion.

Advanced cases cf phthisis will often be much happier
leading an indoor life in their, own unsuitable climate than
an occasional outdoor life in n more favourable on2. This is
especially the case if the patient has very limited means.
He gains sunlight and sunhoat during the day, and runs a.
chance of his disease being arrested; but against this he
must balance draughts and irksome travelling, a paucity of
fireplaces, food and habits to Which he is unsuited, and exile
from his home-comforts and best friends.

I have previously referred to the question as to whether it
is advisable or not to send cases of haunocrhagie phthisis to
Cairo. I have not yet seen any ill result from doing so, and
though I do not wish here to quote medical cases, I will give
the results of the only two patients I have met, with alarm-
ing history of recent haemoptysis. The first case, a friend,
but not a patient of mine, aged 27, had copious hasmoptyssiss,
recurring several times, followed by cough, purulent sputa,
dyspnea, and loss of weight (171, lbs.). Be Was sent to Pau,
Nice, Mont Dore, and eventually to Egypt. He was so
weak that he had to be carried ashore at Suez, and he could
not walk for more than ten minutes at a time. After six
weeks in Cairo, he Went to Luxor for: two months in January,
1888. In March his cough and expectoration had quite
ceased, and he could be out shooting for: three hours at a
time. He gained 191 lbs. weight while in Egypt, and spent
the following winter at Cairo and Luxor, without cough7
oxpeetoration, or hasmoptysis, but still with old physical
signs at the right apex.

The second case was that of a lady, aged 19, whose father,
brother, and sister, had ill died of rapid phthisis with
haemoptysis. She herself had had haemoptysis for a year,
with loss of flesh, night sweats, slight cough, and signs of
incipient disease u one apex. After fifteen weeks at Cairo,
she had gained 151135. weight, and there was general improve-


Appendix. 149

ment in every respect, except that she occasionally had
blood-stained expeetorahion in the morning. In September,
1889, her doctor reported that her: improvement continued,
both lungs were sound, and there had been nu more hremor»
rhage.

There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,
pleuro-pncmmonia, or pneumonia, and anaemic, delicate,
looking people go home sunhumt, and able to walk, ride,
and play lcvrn-tennis, after two Ot' three months' stay in
Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose
themselves to cold and damp during December and January.

I have seen considerable improvement in some cases of
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the general state than locally.
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown
Worst: in Egypt have been complicated with chronic diarrlnnat
There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo
who originally came there from Europe for their health,
some of them having had hwmuptysis and other lung
symptoms

Chronic broruahitis.--A good many emphysemntons patients
come to Cairo every winter, because they find they can get
through the cold months with less cough, less discomfort,
and far: less couthuurusut. Those whose bronchial tubes are
irritated by the fine dust in the air on sand-storm days must
then remain shut up in their houses, just as they would to
avoid fog, rain, and east wind elsewhere.

Ast/tnut.-' the cases that I have seen in Egypt have
improved and done well, excepting two. Several former
asthnvatie patients have settled down as residents in the
country, and um: English lady, who has had dry asthma for
twenty yours, comes every year to Cairo and the Nile because
she is quite well there Hur brother and other relations

discovered. She gets slight asthma in Alexandria, and is
relieved directly she reaches Cairo.

Of the two cases in which there was no improvement, one
Was an English ofiicer who suffered at all times and in all
places except when he was on the sea. At Suakin and
Alexandria he was comfortable, but in Cairo be was liable to
be laid up once a fortnight, and then had to go a short
yachting cruise to get quite rid of his asthma. The second
Case was a very inveterate one, for the lady had been troubled
with asthma and occasional bronchitis for more than twenty
years. At Cairo and Luxor she still had asthma every
morning, but in a modified degree. She believed that she
obtained no good from a dry climate, and like the oifuser,
she pined for the sea air, and stated that in England,
Brighton was the place where she had least asthma.

It is not clii1ieult to understand that asthmatic, patients
who have immunity from their attacks in damp sea air, may
obtain no relief from dry desert air, and the converse is also
apparently true.

To secure the maximum benefit from the climate of Egypt
it seems to be necessary for asthmatic people to keep in the
same temperature as much as possible, and therefore to avoid
night air. One patient, who had had chronic bronchitis and
asthma for two years, obtained great good from six months
spent in Egypt, and though in the succeeding year and a
half she has had pleurisy, she has had no more bronchitis or
asthma.

Rheumatism in an acute form is practically unknown
among the natives and Europeans in Egypt, but I have seen
two cases among young English patients. One caught cold at
Suez, and had in Cairo her second attack of rheumatic fever ;
the other patient had also had a previous attack, and con-
sequent heart-disease, and caught a chill in Cairo during
the Winter. The climate is excellent for all forms of chronic
rheumatism, and for patients convalescing from acute
rheumatism contracted elsewhere. Rheumatic pains and


Appendix. 151

aches are seldom met with except when Cairo is less dry
than usual, The sulphur baths at Helouan are, of course, a
useful help to the dry climate.

Rheumatuid urthritfs I have only once seen in an Egyptian;
but every winter there are numbers of Europeans who come
to Cairo to get rid of their pain, stillness, and swelling,
and to try and postpone their next acute attack. All
those that I have met with have greatly improved, and
among them is the case of a lady who for this disease had
had a previous expcrience of Buxton, Bath, San Remo,
Cannes, Algiers, Pau, Biarritz, Wiesbaden, and Spain. She
has now been for three years running to Cairo, and believes
that the climate is the best she has yet tried, She has had
rheumatic attacks for fifteen years, and for nearly all that
time has had her joints anchylused and swollen, so that the
only ones which remained free were the hips, toes, and
vertebrae.

At the end of the second winter in Cairo, she could stand
and walk alone and almost upright, and was delighted with
her mm activity. She took no drugs, had no sulphur baths,
and no massage during that winter, and only consulted her
doctor upon one day.

She has a distinct family predisposition towards rhenr.
matism; her father was very gouty, mother rheumatic)
mother's father very gouty, and all maternal relatives are
rheumatic. She has lost a sister of rheumatic fever, and
has living a brother who has heart-disease and has had
rheumatic fever three times, and a sister who has chronic
rheumatism after: an acute attack.

Another case was that of :1 lady with a strong Family
history of rheumatism, and a pcrsmml history of fuur years,
She had pveviously tried Buxton, Strathpelfor, Wildbad,
sulphur baths, and massage, with a little temporary improve-
ment after each. When she reached Cairo she could walk
sUflly, but for three years had buun unable to run, dance,
play lawn-tcnnis, or walk downstairs. Two months later she


152 Appendix.

could run a few steps, walk downstairs quickly and without
ungainly gait, and she had Very little pain, and much less
cracking in the knee-juiuts. The improvement was ohieily
due to sunshine and the dry climate, and when the air of
Cairo became hot and dry in April she improved all the
more. The following August she could play golf in Scotland
for two hours at a time, aml had had no return of stiffness
in the joints, though the previous summer she had been
unable to walk on the links even with the aid of a stick.
These brief notes of two cases are suftieient to show that
Egypt is worth a trial to sufferers from rheumatoi d arthritis.

I have seen great improvement and eventual cure in sqme
severe cases of G. rheumatism, the hot dry climate being
the only relieving agent. One patient arrived wholly unable
to walk, with one lower extremity completely stiff, after
severe arthritis keeping him fourteen weeks in bed. In
two months and a half he could walk up and downstairs,
but could not yet kneel; later on he almost recovered in
England.

Gout, again, is an unknown disease among the people of
Egypt, and all chronic cases are liable to be improved thexe,
and the chances of an acute attack me lessened.

Heart disease and kidney disease patients are often sent
to Egypt, the former, because it is a country where active
exercise is not required, and the individual can keep himself
warm without any trouble ', the latter, because the skin will
relieve the kidneys of much otherwise necessary work.

Anamiu, with the train of symptoms with which all
doctors me so familiar in young girls, is the prominent;
sign of a disorder which is tulembly certain to improve
in Cairo. There is a healthy outdoor life, with plenty of
light and warmth, and a sudieiency of daily interest. The
patient soon becomes able to eat and digest, and to take
preparations of iron which had hitherto seemed impossible.
This has been a result quickly arrived at in most cases,

Hepatic diseases.-As the climate of Cairo in winter is


Appendix. 153

not very unlike that of England during a dry summer, I
see no reason why patients with liver disease should not be
sent there or up the Nile, though perhaps it would be unwise
to let them remain after February at Luxor. The ordinary
individual with cirrhosis or other result of alcoholic tendency,
improves temporarily while in Egypt, because he finds it
easier to do without stimulants. The peaceful life on a
dalmbiyeh with agreeable company is sometimes very useful
in such cases.

Lastly, that great and increasing multitude of interesting
patients, the neurotic, men and women, are without excep-
tion so content in Egypt that they have but little time or
inclination to consider their complaints.

THE END.
