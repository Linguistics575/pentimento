and not for more than ten minutes at a time.

It is hardly necessary to remind patients whose
hearts are affected that they should have medical
advice upon the desirability of hot bathing. The
Helouan waters, as I have already said, are
stronger than those of Aix-les-Bains, but they have
not yet the advantage of being accompanied by all

Invalids are often chary of transporting themselves and their relatives from the gaieties of Cairo
to the solitude of Helouan, and to them it can
only be said that, if their physical strength permits, they are easily able to live in Cairo, and to
go four or five days a week to Helouan to [93mÌ¶bÌ¶aÌ¶kÌ¶eÌ¶

[0mtheir baths. But though some men and a few
women prefer to do this, there can be no doubt that
the purer air, earlier hours, and complete repose
of the desert life are most useful adjuncts to the
sulphur baths-and such invalids occasionally need

health, and not for the distractions of their friends.
