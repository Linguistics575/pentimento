Until then individuals must continue to protect
themselves by cutting off all communication with
the ground, and by carefully trapping and ventilating all pipes.

In the mean time, all [93mÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶rÌ¶eÌ¶eÌ¶iÌ¶rÌ¶-Ì¶sÌ¶eÌ¶wÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶sÌ¶ [0m[94mstreet-sewers [0mhave been
blocked and destroyed, because they are unnecessary for storm water, and because it was found
that house proprietors used them as overflows for
their cesspools, and thus vitiated the fresh air of
the streets. At the same time some [91mÌ¶gÌ¶aÌ¶sÌ¶pÌ¶iÌ¶pÌ¶eÌ¶s[0m[91mgnspipes[0m, [93mÌ¶WÌ¶hÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶hÌ¶
