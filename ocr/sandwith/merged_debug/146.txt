130 Egypt as a Winter Resort.
ASSOUAN.
There is no hotel as yet at the First Cataract,
but we ought soon to see one built, for winter
residents at Luxor would find it an agreeable
change to go now and then to Assouan; and
Shellal, opposite the island of [93mÌ¶PÌ¶hÌ¶iÌ¶lÌ¶m[0m[94mPhilae[0m, has been recommended as a perfect [93mÌ¶gÌ¶aÌ¶nÌ¶aÌ¶i[0m[93mÌ¶;[0m[93mÌ¶oÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶uÌ¶mÌ¶ [0m[94maanaborium [0mby Dr. Abbate

Assouan is 133 miles higher up the river than
Luxor-that is, 583 miles south of Cairo. The
temple of Esueh is only 35 miles from Luxor, and
Edfu temple is half-way to Assouan; then, 26 miles
further on, we come to the sights of Silsileh, and
then the temple of Kom Ombo, a few miles north
of Assouan.
Assouan has [93mÌ¶a[0m[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[94ma [0mvaried native population of about
