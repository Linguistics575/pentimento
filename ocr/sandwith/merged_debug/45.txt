But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally low-to an absolute minimum
of 4 on March 24, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.
