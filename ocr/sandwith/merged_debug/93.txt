Excursions from Cairo. 77
monumental wonders are suffieientiy set forth in
the guide-books; but some of them are kept purposely buried in the sand to prevent destruction.
It is usually said that the [93mÌ¶mÌ¶uÌ¶mÌ¶mÌ¶iÌ¶oÌ¶dÌ¶ [0m[94mmummied [0mbulls from
the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer
accidentally found three of them in 1887 in the
Historical Soeiety's Museum in New York. They
were probably stolen and bought when the [93mÌ¶SÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶aÌ¶pÌ¶eÌ¶uÌ¶nÌ¶lÌ¶ [0m[94mSerapeum [0mwas discovered in 1861. The tomb of [93mÌ¶TÌ¶iÌ¶h[0m[94mTill[0m, of
the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such
excellent preservation that it should be visited by
all; and there is another tomb kept closed which
is by no means inferior. From these life-like
sculptures and others much has been learnt about
the manners and customs of those who lived more
than five thousand years ago.
