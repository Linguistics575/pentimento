and the risks of a sudden drop of the thermometer.
In March it will often be necessary to pursue the
opposite tactics, and shut windows during the
greatest heat of the day, to keep the bedroom from
getting too hot. This was not done in March,
1878, and consequently the bedroom average
jumped up to over 77". Dr. Maclean made some
further experiments, to show that the lowest [93mÌ¶i[0m[93mÌ¶;[0m[93mÌ¶eÌ¶mÌ¶pÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶aÌ¶tÌ¶uÌ¶rÌ¶eÌ¶ [0m[94mtemperature [0min the bedroom was usually 20Â° higher

The daily [93mÌ¶mÌ¶nÌ¶gÌ¶eÌ¶ [0m[94mrange [0mof the thermometer is always
very great, as one would expect in an inland dry
country of the latitude of Luxor. The temperature falls at night, in consequence of the rapid
radiation of heat which obtains under a cloudless
sky. But the range of maximum heat from one
day to another, for the first three months of the
year, is [93mÌ¶fÌ¶yÌ¶1Ì¶f[0m[94m3C[0m', [93mÌ¶'Ì¶W[0m[93mÌ¶'[0m[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[93mÌ¶3Ì¶'Ì¶8[0m[94m4-7[0m"[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[93mÌ¶3Ì¶8Ì¶Â°[0m, showing that during the
