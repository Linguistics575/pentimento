sky is a real treat, for the cloudy nights are few

in Cairo, but not in the latitudes of London,
Boston, or Philadelphia, are Canopus and Horologium at the beginning of the year; while the
Southern Cross shows about two-thirds of its
height in May and June, though the foot of the
cross cannot be seen till one goes south of Assouan. Ara and the Centaur are well seen in
July, and the [93mÌ¶wÌ¶lÌ¶1Ì¶oÌ¶lÌ¶sÌ¶ [0m[94mwhole [0mof the Scorpion shows to perfection; also at the close of the year we have the
