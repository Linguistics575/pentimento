Cairo. 21
The subsoil of Cairo is washed every year by the
Nile, which brings to it in the summer the rain
from the mountains of Abyssinia. In June the
river at Cairo is at its lowest; then slowly begins
to rise throughout J uly, and reaches its maximum
flood in the first ten days of September, remaining
high during September; and in October attains an
artificial height, in consequence of the irrigation
basins in Upper Egypt then allowing the water
to escape and swirl on to complete the flood [93mÌ¶iÌ¶rÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶gÌ¶ [0m[93mÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶oÌ¶n[0m[94mirrigation[0m. During October the water gradually recedes
from the basins, and is carried all over Lower
Egypt by an elaborate system of canals, so that
the early months of the year become gradually
drier and drier, until the period of low Nile is
again reached in May.
