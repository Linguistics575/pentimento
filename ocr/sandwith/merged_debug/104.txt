But, though I give an analysis of all three kinds
of waters, the only important one at present is the
sulphur variety. It owes its sulphur properties
to the chemical processes which sulphate of lime,
meeting with nitrogenous matter and becoming
sulphate of calcium, produces by setting free
carbonic acid and nitrogen from the decomposition
of the nitrogenous matter. Then the carbonic acid
decomposes the sulphate of calcium and forms
carbonate of lime, which, in presence of an excess
of carbonic acid and under great pressure, is converted into [93mÌ¶a[0m[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[94ma [0mvery soluble bicarbonate of lime,
which at last sets free sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
The nitrogenous organic matter which is found
in all the Helouan waters has been named BarÃ©gine,
because it was first discovered in the BarÃ©ges
waters of the Pyrenees. It is found in all sulphur
waters when exposed to light and air, and is the
cause of the greenish vegetation which collects
round the edges of stagnant sulphur water. The
sulphur is [93mÌ¶sÌ¶uÌ¶fÌ¶iÌ¶iÌ¶eÌ¶iÌ¶eÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶lÌ¶yÌ¶ [0m[94msufficiently [0mstrong in the air to turn
