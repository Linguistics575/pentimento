of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no
alluvium, which is of course the only soil in
Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm
of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile
soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world
in composition.

The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal
Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several

The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium
were found to continue down to the depth of
121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level
of the Mediterranean. At that depth [93mÌ¶a[0m[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[94ma [0mremarkable change in the deposits took place, and beds
