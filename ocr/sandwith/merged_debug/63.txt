Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but
only from August to November: it is a painful
malady, without danger to life. Typhus and
relapsing fevers occur in the [93mÌ¶sÌ¶pÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶nÌ¶g[0m[93mÌ¶,Ì¶ [0m[94mspring [0mamong overcrowded natives, but no case has been known
among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we
hope for ever, in 1814. Small-pos, as in other
parts of the world, is liable to occur among

and causes many deaths ; but I know of no visitors
who have caught the disease, and only a dozen

Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard
of at very rare intervals among the British troops.
Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,

Congestion of the liver is more likely to attack
alcoholic residents than visitors, and both classes
