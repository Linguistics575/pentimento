38 Egypt as a Winter Resort.
Cairo after the middle of the month, because the
summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and
winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the
proportion of heat to dampness is still great,
mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not
advised to arrive till the last days, of the month
at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper
Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.
Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and eustardapples. Bananas have begun, and continue all the
winter. Among flowers there are dahlia, Zinnia,
Periwinkle, and tuberoses.

Decembor.--At the end of the month we are
liable to a little cloud and rain, and invalids who
want to avoid all cold damp should go up to Luxor.
Temperature like a dry September in England.
