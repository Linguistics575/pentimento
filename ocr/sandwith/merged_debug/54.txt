38 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Cairo after the middle of the month, because the
summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and
winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the
proportion of heat to dampness is still great,
mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not
advised to arrive till the last days, of the month
at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper
Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.
Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and [91mÌ¶cÌ¶uÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶dÌ¶aÌ¶pÌ¶pÌ¶lÌ¶eÌ¶s[0m[91meustardapples[0m. Bananas have begun, and continue all the
winter. Among flowers there are dahlia, Zinnia,
Periwinkle, and tuberoses.
