Cairo. 55

Most of the ice bought in Cairo is made from
the filtered water by the Water Company.

of the European quarters that were cleaned, and
this work was done at shameful expense by a contractor employed by the Governor of Cairo. Now
the work is well done by the Sanitary Department
all over the town, and at a less cost than before.
All streets are kept swept, the made roads are
watered by carts every day, and the narrow lanes in
the native quarters are watered by the inhabitants
with goat-skins. Up till 7 a.m. the householders
are allowed to deposit in the street in heaps their
dry refuse, which is collected in carts, and either
burnt in the Turkish baths or shot outside the
town. This successfully prevents all the dust-bin
nuisances, and is very important in [93mÌ¶rÌ¶mÌ¶ [0m[94man [0mOriental
country where women and children seldom leave
the house, and are unprovided in the poorest cases
with water-closets.
