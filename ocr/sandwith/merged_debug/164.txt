I have previously referred to the question as to whether it
is advisable or not to send cases of [93mÌ¶hÌ¶aÌ¶uÌ¶nÌ¶oÌ¶cÌ¶rÌ¶hÌ¶aÌ¶gÌ¶iÌ¶eÌ¶ [0m[94mhaemorrhagic [0mphthisis to
Cairo. I have not yet seen any ill result from doing so, and
though I do not wish here to quote medical cases, I will give
the results of the only two patients I have met, with alarming history of recent haemoptysis. The first case, a friend,
but not a patient of mine, aged 27, had copious [93mÌ¶hÌ¶aÌ¶sÌ¶mÌ¶oÌ¶pÌ¶tÌ¶yÌ¶sÌ¶sÌ¶iÌ¶sÌ¶s[0m[94mhaemoptysis[0m,

dyspnea, and loss of weight ([93mÌ¶1Ì¶7Ì¶l[0m[94m171[0m, lbs.). Be Was sent to Pau,
Nice, Mont Dore, and eventually to Egypt. He was so
weak that he had to be carried ashore at Suez, and he could
not walk for more than ten minutes at a time. After six
weeks in Cairo, he [93mÌ¶WÌ¶eÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶ [0m[94mwent [0mto Luxor [93mÌ¶fÌ¶oÌ¶r[0m[93mÌ¶:Ì¶ [0m[94mfor [0mtwo months in [93mÌ¶JÌ¶ [0m[93mÌ¶aÌ¶nÌ¶uÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶yÌ¶ [0m[94mJanuary[0m,
