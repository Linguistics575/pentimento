Near Cairo there are in the desert numerous
dry river-beds, telling of the time when there was
an abundant rainfall, and the wild elephant, which
has now retreated south of the Soudan, could take
his fill of water and green food. The existence of
ravines and rounded pebbles must not be taken as
evidence of a great rainfall in prehistoric times,
for even to-day, although there is so little [93mÌ¶mÌ¶iÌ¶nÌ¶ [0m[94mrain [0min

very heavy torrential storms, which, although the

Enough has been written to show that the
alluvial soil deposited by the Nile is an entirely
foreign element in the geological formation of
Egypt, and it may be easily studied in the [93mÌ¶pÌ¶oÌ¶rÌ¶
