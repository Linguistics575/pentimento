aches are seldom met with except when Cairo is less dry
than usual[91m, [0mThe sulphur baths at Helouan are, of course, a
useful help to the dry climate.

[94mRheumatoid [0m[94marthritis [0mI have only once seen in an Egyptian;
but every winter there are numbers of Europeans who come
to Cairo to get rid of their pain, [91mstillness[0m, and swelling,
and to try and postpone their next acute attack. All
those that I have met with have greatly improved, and
among them is the case of a lady who for this disease had
had a previous [94mexperience [0mof Buxton, Bath, San Remo,
Cannes, Algiers, Pau, Biarritz, Wiesbaden, and Spain. She
has now been for three years running to Cairo, and believes
that the climate is the best she has yet tried[91m, [0mShe has had
rheumatic attacks for fifteen years, and for nearly all that
time has had her joints [94manchylosed [0mand swollen, so that the
only ones which remained free were the hips, toes, and
vertebrae.

At the end of the second winter in Cairo, she could stand
and walk alone and almost upright, and was delighted with
her [94mown [0mactivity. She took no drugs, had no sulphur baths,
and no massage during that winter, and only consulted her
doctor upon one day.

She has a distinct family predisposition towards [94mrheumatism[0m; her father was [94mvery [0mgouty, mother rheumatic[91m)
[0mmother's father very gouty, and all maternal relatives are
rheumatic. She has lost a sister of rheumatic fever, and
has living a brother who has heart-disease and has had
rheumatic fever three times, and a sister who has chronic
rheumatism [94mafter [0man acute attack[91m.

[0mAnother case [94mwas [0mthat of [94ma [0mlady with a strong [94mfamily
[0mhistory of rheumatism, and a [94mpersonal [0mhistory of [94mfour [0myears[91m,
[0mShe had [94mpreviously [0mtried Buxton, [94mStrathpeffer[0m, Wildbad,
sulphur baths, and massage, with a little temporary improvement after each. When she reached Cairo she could walk
[91msUflly[0m, but for three years had [94mbeen [0munable to run, dance,
play [91mlawn-tcnnis[0m, or walk downstairs. Two months later she
