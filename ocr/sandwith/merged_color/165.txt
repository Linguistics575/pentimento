ment in every respect, except that she occasionally had
blood-stained [94mexpectoration [0min the morning. In September,
1889, her doctor reported that [94mher [0mimprovement continued,
both lungs were sound, and there had been [94mno [0mmore [91mhzemorrhage[0m.

There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,
[94mpleuro-pneumonia[0m, or pneumonia, and anaemic, [94mdelicate[0m[94m,

and play [94mlawn-tennis[0m, after two [94mor [0mthree months' stay in
Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose
themselves to cold and damp during December and [94mJanuary[0m.

I have seen [94mconsiderable [0mimprovement in some cases of
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the [94mgeneral [0mstate than locally.
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown
[94mworse [0min Egypt have been complicated with chronic [94mdiarrhoea[0m[94m.
[0mThere are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo
who originally came there from Europe for their health,
some of them having had [94mhaemoptysis [0mand other lung

come to Cairo every winter, because they find they can get
through the cold months with less cough, less discomfort,
and [94mfar [0mless [91mcouthuurusut[0m. Those whose bronchial tubes are
irritated by the fine dust in the air on sand-storm days must
then remain shut up in their houses, just as they would to
avoid fog, rain, and east wind elsewhere.

improved and done well, excepting two. Several former
