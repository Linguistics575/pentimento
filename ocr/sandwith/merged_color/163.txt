in whom [94mphthisis [0m[94mis [0msuspected goes or is taken by his relatives
to a doctor to have his chest examined, it may generally [94mbe
[0mprophesied either that there is no ground for uneasiness, [94mor
[0mthat the disease has already made distinct progress. Incipient
cases which gain weight and improve in [94mother [0mrespects
during a winter abroad, often need to be reminded that the
measure should be repeated [94ma [0msecond time.

Popular young patients must often be banished from Cairo
during December and January, to desert life at the Pyramids,
or [94mat [0m[94mLusor[0m, to protect them from themselves and their
acquaintance, and the snares of evening engagements.

Chronic cases of undoubted phthisis do [94mvery [0mwell in Egypt,
for they improve in general health, digestion, and appetite,
and can often take [94mcod-liver [0moil, which was previously [94mimpossible[0m. They are encouraged by finding that they gain a
little weight, and become rid of troublesome cough and
[91mexpectomtion[0m. This last symptom is an important one in
Egypt, and one of the first signs of the [94mpatient[0m[94mâ€™[0m[94ms [0mimprovement.

An ordinary [91mphthisieal [0mindividual complains, when he [94mfirst
[0mreaches Cairo, of cough and [94mexpectoration[0m, and the stethoscope
reveals a multitude of large and small moist sounds. When
he is seen again a fortnight later, these sounds have partly
disappeared, he still coughs, but is surprised and sometimes
alarmed to notice that the [91mexpectoratior1 [0mhas suddenly
diminished. After another week or two, he reports that he
only [94mexpectorates [0mthe first thing in the morning ; he seldom
coughs during the day, and the stethoscope again [94mconfirms
[0mthe drying-up process which is going on in the lung, which
seems to be the direct result of dry air inhaled. This is not
so wonderful [94mwhen [0mwe remember that [94mthe [0maverage winter
humidity of the Cairo [94mair [0mis under sixty-six per cent. (Table
[94mL[0m), while that of London is above ninety per cent. It would
be [94minteresting [0mto know whether the very dry air is inimical
to the life and development of the tubercle bacillus. Two
cases in which bacilli were [91mseen [0min London and on arrival
in Cairo, and could not be found before leaving Cairo and
