dig, the [91mCebris [0mof bricks, granite, marble, pottery,

After the records of Arab historians we come
down to 1830, when [91mLiuant [0mPasha, a French
engineer, discovered that the region of sulphur
springs extended southward from [94mHelouan [0mto
opposite [91mBenisuef[0m, where [94mborings [0mused to be made
by the natives, who bathed in the springs and built
tents near them. In [91m1819 [0mthe Egyptian Government took possession of [94mHelouan[0m, built wooden
huts, and even sent sick soldiers to be experimented
on by the waters. The results were so satisfactory
that the spot began to be a little popular, but [94mit
[0mwas not until 1871 [94mthat [0mthe Government could
make up its mind either to work the springs itself
[94mor [0mto let them to an intelligent European. In
that year a Dr. [94mReil [0mwas appointed Director
of the Baths, a small town began gradually to
spring up, and in 1873 the Grand Hotel was
[94mbuilt [0mand was [91meonfided [0mto its present manager.
Trees were planted, the swamps were drained,
and in 1876 a railway from Cairo was opened.
Great improvements have been made to the baths,
and the place is every [94myear [0m[94mbecoming [0m[94mmore [0mpopular,
the number of baths [94mduring [0m1885 having been only
[91m7031[0m, and being new doubled every year.
