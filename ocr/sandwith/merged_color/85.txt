Cairo. [91m69

[0maccurate a picture of early Christian worship as
can anywhere be found. Some of them still have
[91meonvents [0madjoining, and are surrounded by thick
walls like a fortress, telling tales of old persecution
about the days of the fifth century, when the Bible
was translated into the Coptic tongue.

Besides some of the usually visited churches in
old Cairo, a Copt should be engaged to take the
visitor to the Church of the Virgin, near the
[91mMuuski[0m, where may be seen the original type of
the Coptic basilica, with a [91mbaldaorhino [0msupported by
four columns and semicircular stone seats arranged
round the apse, and indeed much else of interest.

The modern Coptic cathedral is only worth
visiting, to see the service, such as on Easter Eve
01' Easter Day; but it must be remembered that
their festivals sometimes [94mtake [0mplace according to
0111' calendar, and sometimes by the Old Style,
twelve days later.

A riding or driving excursion [94mwill [0mof course be
made to [94mthe [0m[94mnecropolis [0mof [94mKnit [0mBey, and [94mto [0mthe
so-called tombs of the [91mMemlooks[0m[91m,

[0mThe palaces of [91mShoobra[0m, [91mGhezirch[0m, and Ghizeh
are all worth visiting if a permit can be obtained,
because they have lovely gardens, and remind one
of the former glories of late Khedives. It is to the
last of these three that the [91mBoulak [0mMuseum is now
being transferred.
