130 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

ASSOUAN.

There is no hotel as yet at the First Cataract,
but we ought soon to see one built, for winter
residents at Luxor would find it an agreeable
change to go now and then to Assouan; and
Shellal, opposite the island of [94mPhilae[0m, has been recommended as a perfect [91maanaborium [0mby Dr. Abbate
Pasha.

Assouan is 133 miles higher up the river than
Luxor-that is, 583 miles south of Cairo. The
temple of [91mEsueh [0mis only 35 miles from Luxor, and
Edfu temple is half-way to Assouan; then, 26 miles
further on, we come to the sights of Silsileh, and
then the temple of Kom Ombo, a few miles north
of Assouan.

Assouan has [94ma [0mvaried native population of about
9000, and is well guarded by forts, and by 2000
Egyptian troops under English [91moffieers[0m.

Visitors will be interested in the granite quarries,
rocks of schist, granite, and basalt, Sir F. Grenfell[91m's [0mtombs, [94mElephantine [0mIsland, the shooting of
the cataract, and the lovely temple on the Island
of [91mPhilm[0m.

[94mTemperature-No [0mregular meteorological records
have been taken at Assouan, but the Army Medical
Staff took a few notes during the Nile expedition
