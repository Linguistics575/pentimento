el-Fayoum, and fourteen miles from Beni-souef
station. Mr. [94mPetrie [0mhas now opened this Pyramid
also, and has cleared its temple, which is half [94ma
[0mmile to the east. Fragments of this temple are
now in England, dating from [91mUsertasen [0m[91mll[0m. of the
Twelfth Dynasty. One of the most interesting
discoveries is that the town of the builders of this
Pyramid joins the temple on the north, and here
may be seen rows of houses for workmen and for
stores, and numerous [94mflint [0minstruments lying
about. Many papyri and tools were found, and
pottery with Cypriote letters on it, thus proving
the early date of the Cypriote alphabet. There
is plenty of pottery of the Twelfth Dynasty lying
about; and to the west and south of the Pyramid
is a cemetery which was originally used by the
Twelfth Dynasty, and later used again from the
[94mTwenty-first [0mto the Twenty-sixth. [94mN [0m[94mear [0mthe temple
are Coptic graves of the fourth century of the
Christian [91mem[0m.

13. Medineh Grob ([91mix[0m. raven) is at the south
end of the [91mIllahun [0mdyke, which originally dated
from the Twelfth Dynasty, but has since shifted
its position. Here there is a town of the [94mNineteenth
[0mDynasty, built over the ruins of a temple of
[94mThothmes [0mIII., and from here much Greek pottery
of the [94mMycenae [0mtype, with Cypriote and [94mPhoenician
[0mletters on it, has been sent to the British Museum.
