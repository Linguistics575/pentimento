2 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

civilization which have attended the efforts of her
[94mofficials [0mon the spot, and the improved facilities
for travelling obtained by Messrs. Cook, have all
tended to make Cairo and the Nile a very favourite
winter resort. Some six thousand visitors come to
Cairo during the winter months, and of these about
twelve hundred proceed up the Nile in steamer or
in dahabiyeh. To show that the climate deals
fairly [94mwith [0mthese masses of visitors, it may be
mentioned that the writer, in a medical experience
of [94msix [0mwinters, has lost only two patients who came
to Egypt for their health. Both these were
patients far advanced in consumption, who ought
never to have left their homes, one an Australian,
who reached Cairo [94mat [0mthe beginning of 1888, and
died there in February; the other, an American,
who died in December, 1888, a few hours after
reaching Cairo. This experience is not only [94ma
[0mpersonal one, for the death register shows that
there have been only nine deaths among British
visitors in Cairo during the [94mgig [0myears ending [94mJune[0m,
[91m1880[0m. Of these nine, seven arrived here ill of
incurable diseases; the eighth was thought to be
robust, but died of [94muraemic [0mpoisoning during her
first week in [91mCairo[0m; and the ninth caught [94ma [0mchill
while out sketching, and died of double pneumonia.
But the writer's object is not to try and prove
that Egypt is the best health-resort in the world,
