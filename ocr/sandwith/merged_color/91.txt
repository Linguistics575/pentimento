Excursions from Cairo. 75

[94mAbu-el-Stroud [0mis another water named after an
Egyptian doctor of the [94mfifteenth [0mcentury. It is
without colour and odour, and keeps well in a hot
country. It is in great request among some
Europeans and natives for disorders of digestion,
and it has a distinct aperient effect. Its [94msource
[0mis said to be from the [94mMokattam [0mhills, and it is
drunk at an establishment in Old Cairo, or bottled
there for home use. There is also [94ma [0mswimming
bath there of temperature 86Â° Fahr. No accurate
analysis has yet been made. Reaction neutral;
no gas; temperature, 86Â° Fahr. The principal
ingredients are sulphates of soda and magnesia,
and [94mchlorides [0mof sodium, magnesium, and calcium.
There are no nitrates or ammonia.

The Barrage should certainly be visited, if it
is only to see how the pluck and skill of English
engineers have made it possible for some nine feet
of water to be held up at the times when every
drop of the Nile is wanted for [94mland-irrigation[0m.
It is a long ride, but [94ma [0mvery pleasant trip by
steamer 01' by train, and the neighbourhood is very
pretty.

[91mScrhbirah.-Tlse [0m[91mpleasantest [0mway of making this
excursion is by steamer to and from Cairo; but
even then there is a two hours' donkey-ride from
the landing-place to the Necropolis. If a steamer
cannot be obtained, it is quite possible to go by
