20 Egypt as a [94mWinter [0mResort.

[91mpendieular [0m[91msepia-coloured [0mmud-banks, [94mwhich [0mvary
slightly in colour, and have occasional thin layers
of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no
alluvium, which is of course the only soil in
Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm
of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile
soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world
in composition.

The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal
Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several
[94mborings [0mthrough this soil to the old [94mfloor [0mof the Delta.
The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium
were found to continue down to the depth of
121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level
of the Mediterranean. At that depth [94ma [0mremarkable change in the deposits took place, and beds
of gravel containing both pebbles and [94msubangular
[0mfragments of quartzite, chert, compact limestone,
[94mwith [0msome metamorphic and igneous rocks, were
found, and similar beds occurred at intervals down
to the greatest depth reached. [94mUp [0mto the present
time [94mno [0mcontemporaneous organic remains have
been found in these deposits. The borings near
the Nile at Cairo in 1883 may be [94mbriefly [0msummarized thus: For 6 ft. beneath the surface, dry
[94mmould[0m; from 7 ft. to 16 ft., dry sandy [94mmould[0m; from
17 ft. to 38 ft., wet sand; and from 39 ft. to 45 ft.,
wet coarse sand.
