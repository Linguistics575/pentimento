on its west beyond the Pyramids; (2) a little
calcareous sandstone (Miocene) containing trunks
of petrified trees; (3) raised beaches of a more
recent time, [91m{[0mmade of gravel, sand, and seashells,
near Cairo and Suez ; (4) alluvial deposits forming
the Nile valley and [91mDelta[0m; and (5) recent sandhills
marking the old centre of the bay of Lower Egypt,
in the days when the Mediterranean washed the
Mokattam heights and the terrace on [94mwhich [0mthe
Pyramids now stand.

Near Cairo there are in the desert numerous
dry river-beds, telling of the time when there was
an abundant rainfall, and the wild elephant, which
has now retreated south of the Soudan, could take
his fill of water and green food. The existence of
ravines and rounded pebbles must not be taken as
evidence of a great rainfall in prehistoric times,
for even to-day, although there is so little [94mrain [0min
Cairo, there are sometimes in the hills above Cairo
very heavy torrential storms, which, although the
quantity of rain is not great, sweep down the
valleys and actually cover the neighbouring fields
with [94ma [0myellow mud and with small pebbles.

Enough has been written to show that the
alluvial soil deposited by the Nile is an entirely
foreign element in the geological formation of
Egypt, and it may be easily studied in the [94mper
