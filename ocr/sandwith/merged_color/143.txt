moisture only reached 60, while the minimum fell
to 21 per cent.

[91mRuin [0mis indeed rare at Luxor, for there was none
in November and December, 1881, and this is by
no means unusual. In January, 1882, there was
none; but in 1878 there was one shower, and
another in [94mJanuary [0m1888. In the month of
February, 1878, there was a shower, another in
1882, again in 1887, and three minutes' rain was
recorded by Dr. Boase in 1888.

March. There would thus seem to be only two or
three days in the year when rain falls at Luxor[91m.
[0mThunder and lightning are rarer still.

The amount of cloud is very little in the year,
but the sky was noted as being completely [94movercast [0mfour times in [94mJanuary[0m, once in February, and
three times in March.

The amount [94m0 [0m[94mozone [0mwas estimated by [94mnoting

paper prepared with iodide of potassium and
starch, after it had been exposed to the air in [94ma

out that when the barometer stood high, and the
temperature not great, the largest amounts of [94mozone
[0mwere present, while little ozone was indicated with
a low barometer on a hot day.
