lighted. When there is 110 moon, the star-spangled
sky is a real treat, for the cloudy nights are few
and far between, and the flat roofs of the houses
easily lend themselves to the studies of amateur
astronomers. Among the stars which can be seen
in Cairo, but not in the latitudes of London,
Boston, or Philadelphia, are Canopus and Horologium at the beginning of the year; while the
Southern Cross shows about two-thirds of its
height in May and June, though the foot of the
cross cannot be seen till one goes south of Assouan. Ara and the Centaur are well seen in
July, and the [94mwhole [0mof the Scorpion shows to perfection; also at the close of the year we have the
Crane and the Phoenix. The Milky Way is always
beautiful, and the study of the stars has [94ma [0mspecial
attraction in a country where one can become
familiar with the original Arabic names still used
by all those who have acquired the knowledge of
the named stars.
