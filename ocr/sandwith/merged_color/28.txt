Europe by way of Alexandria. Port Said, [94mWith [0m[94ma
[0mpopulation of about 10,500 natives and 6000
Europeans, is an impromptu insanitary town
[94mwhich [0moriginated in 1859 [94mwith [0mthe huts of the

sand two hundred to three hundred yards wide,
between Lake [91mMeuzaleh [0mand the sea, its site
having been formed by dredgings from the harbour
thrown into the shallow lake. The surface of the
town is perfectly flat, and only about four feet
above the sea-level, and the sandy soil is permeated
by [91muneemcnted [0m[91meesspools [0mand underground reservoirs used by some of the inhabitants. It is
