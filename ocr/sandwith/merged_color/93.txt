Excursions from Cairo. 77

monumental wonders are [91msuffieientiy [0mset forth in
the [91mguide-books[0m; but some of them are kept purposely buried in the sand to prevent destruction.
It is usually said that the [94mmummied [0mbulls from
the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer
accidentally found three of them in 1887 in the
Historical [91mSoeiety[0m's Museum in New York. They
were probably stolen and bought when the [94mSerapeum [0mwas discovered in 1861. The tomb of [94mTill[0m, of
the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such
excellent preservation that it should be visited by
all; and there is another tomb kept closed which
is by no means inferior. From these life-like
sculptures and others much has been learnt about
the manners and customs of those who lived more
than five thousand years ago.

Recent discoveries in [91mEyyptt[0m--[94mFull [0maccounts of
the late discoveries of Mr. Flinders Petrie, and
of Mr. [91mNaville [0mfor the [91mEgyptian [0mExploration Fund,
[94mhave [0mbeen published in their special transactions,
but not yet in the guide-books, so the remainder of
this chapter will be devoted to recapitulating them
for the benefit of travellers who desire to visit the
spots which have been worked during the English
occupation.
