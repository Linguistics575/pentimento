Cairo. 27

was 111'8Â° on July 13, while on the night of
[94mJanuary [0m20, the absolute minimum of [91m364[0m[91m" [0mwas
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was
110Â° on June 9, and the lowest minimum
was 35"[94mY [0min [94mJanuary[0m. Freezing-point seems
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the
desert, may be found occasionally [94mwith [0ma thin
coating of ice. I may say here, for the [94minformation [0mof those who believe that Cairo is a furnace
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of
rooms on the north side of the house, kept properly shut during the hot hours, need never during
the [94myear [0mexceed [94m83Â° [0mFahr.; and, on the other
hand, that the same rooms, [94mduring [0mthe depths of
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm
outer air during the day, need never have [91ma. [0mtemperature below 52Â° Fahr., without employing a
fire[91m, [0mBy living in sunny south rooms, or by employing [94martificial [0mheat, the invalid can be certain
all night in the winter of a temperature of [91mGW'
[0m[91mFalw.[0m, or more.

My observations, therefore, correspond with the
results obtained by the Rev[91m, [0mDr. Barnett in Cairo,
Which I give in Table II. For nearly two years
he took observations six times daily, from [94m6 [0m[94mmm[0m.
to [94m9 [0mp.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of
an ordinary house.
