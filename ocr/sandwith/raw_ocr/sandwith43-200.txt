Cairo. 27

was 111'8° on July 13, while on the night of
January 20, the absolute minimum of 364" was
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was
110° on June 9, and the lowest minimum
was 35"Y in January. Freezing-point seems
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the
desert, may be found occasionally With a thin
coating of ice. I may say here, for the informa.
tion of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of
rooms on the north side of the house, kept pro-
perly shut during the hot hours, need never during
the year' exceed 8Y Fahr.; and, on the other
hand, that the same rooms, during the depths of
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm
outer air during the day, need never have a. tem-
perature below 52° Fahr., without employing a
fire, By living in sunny south rooms, or by em-
ploying ariifieial heat, the invalid can be certain
all night in the winter of a temperature of GW'
Falw., or more.

My observations, therefore, correspond with the
results obtained by the Rev, Dr. Barnett in Cairo,
Which I give in Table II. For nearly two years
he took observations six times daily, from 6 mm.
to f) p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of
an ordinary house.
