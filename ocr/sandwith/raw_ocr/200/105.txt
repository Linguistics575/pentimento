but various fires have destroyed all trace of former
dwellings. There remain, however, for those who

glass, and even coins.

After the records of Arab historians we come
down to 1830, when Liuant Pasha, a French
engineer, discovered that the region of sulphur
springs extended southward from Helouau to
opposite Benisuef, where horings used to be made
by the natives, who bathed in the springs and built
tents near them. In 1819 the Egyptian Govern-
ment took possession of Helotmu, built wooden
huts, and even sent sick soldiers to be experimented
on by the waters. The results were so satisfactory
that the spot began to be a little popular, but it,
was not until 1871 that- the Government could
make up its mind either to work the springs itself
01' to let them to an intelligent European. In
that year a Dr. Reil was appointed Director
of the Baths, a small town began gradually to
spring up, and in 1873 the Grand Hotel was
built and was eonfided to its present manager.
Trees were planted, the swamps were drained,
and in 1876 a railway from Cairo was opened.
Great improvements have been made to the baths,
and the place is every yearbeeonliug 11i01'0 popular,
the number of baths during 1885 having been only
7031, and being new doubled every year.
