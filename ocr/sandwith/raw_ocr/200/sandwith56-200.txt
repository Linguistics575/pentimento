week of the month is often hot, but previous to

plover, and dove shooting. Dianthus, pansy,
China aster, marguerites, delphinium, fuchsia,
gladiolus, lobelia, sweet pea, and wall-flowers.
Acacia. trees in the boulevards shed their leaves
and remain bare for about a month.

April.~The days are warm like the hottest days
in an English summer, but are not felt so oppres-
sive because of the dryness of the air. The houses
and habits of the country are also specially adapted
for the hot weather. Rooms are now occupied
which face towards the north and catch the eool
wind, and on hot days it is wisest not to go out
immediately after luncheon. Europeap,louses
and hotels are built so that the rooms are sixteen
feet high, thus providing for plenty of cubic space
when the windows are obliged to be closed to keep
out the heat and the flies and mosquitoes, which
now begin to be troublesome. The khamseen wind
occurs at intervals of about ten days, and great
care ought to be taken not to relinquish all winter
