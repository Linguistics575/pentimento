EGYPT AS A WINTER RESORT.

INTRODUCTION.

THIS handbook is a humble endeavour to answer
the queries of some of my esteemed medical friends
in England and in the United States, who tell me
they are sometimes at a loss to know What manner
of patients they ought and ought not to send to
Egypt. But, apart from the actual needs of
invalids and their professional advisers, there is
a large class of visitors who either accompany
delicate friends abroad, or flee from their own
homes merely to escape cold weather and bask in
the sunshine. It is obvious that a health-resort
which provides a suitable climate for invalids and
a sufficiency of interest and occupation for healthy
individuals will become more and more popular.
The national interest which England has taken in
Egypt since 1882, the growing prosperity and

civilization which have attended the efforts of her
officials on the spot, and the improved facilities
for travelling obtained by Messrs. Cook, have all
tended to make Cairo and the Nile a very favourite
winter resort. Some six thousand visitors come to
Cairo during the winter months, and of these about
twelve hundred proceed up the Nile in steamer or
in dahabiyeh. To show that the climate deals
fairly with these masses of visitors, it may be
mentioned that the writer, in a medical experience
of six winters, has lost only two patients who came
to Egypt for their health. Both these were
patients far advanced in consumption, who ought
never to have left their homes, one an Australian,
who reached Cairo u the beginning of 1888, and
died there in February; the other, an American,
who died in December, 1888, a few hours after
reaching Cairo. This experience is not only a.
personal one, for the death register shows that
there have been only nine deaths among British
visitors in Cairo during the sj} years ending June,
1880. Of these nine, seven arrived here ill of
incurable diseases; the eighth was thought to be
robust, but died of uraunic poisoning during her
first week in Cairo; and the ninth caught a. chill
while out sketching, and died of double pneumonia.
But the writer's object is not to try and prove
that Egypt is the best health-resort in the world,

but to give reasonable information about its climate
to those who have practically decided against the
respective merits of sea and mountain air, and
are in search of pure dry desert, air where min is
almost unknown, and where fog, strong winds, and
cold are never felt.

At the outset it must be remembered that where
the air is extremely dry, there the difference is the
greatest between the maximum and minimum
temperatures, for the sun's heat reaches the earth
Without difficulty by day, and again by night it
disappears into space. Patients, therefore, can bask
in Egypt in the temperature of an English summer
by daylight, but must be prepared for autumnal
cold after sunset. The summer months in England
under favourable circumstances are well suited to
those of feeble constitution, who can surround
themselves in their own homes with modern
luxuries, with the comforts which none but the
English thoroughly study, and with all the plea-
sures of friends and family. But when the autumn
cold requires such a one to take active outdoor
exercise, for which he is not suflieiently robust,
and when the absence of sunshine induces a de-
pression of spirits in addition to his physical
delicacy, he begins, if he is wise, to think of
deserting Isis home comforts and of seeking a.
more cheerful climate like many migratory birds,

whom he would do well to imitate. Judged by the
thermometer, we find that the mean annual tem-
perature of London is 50° Palm, and the same
isothermal line passes through New York, though
the climates of the two cities are from other
reasons widely different. The Royal Observatory
at Greenwich supplies us with {1, daily average tem-
perature for the last fifty years, and by consulting
this we find that on October 19 the average tem-
perature falls below 50°, descending in January
to MP, and never regaining 50° again till May.
Roughly speaking, those fleeing from cold must
leave England not later than the middle of October,
and should not return there till at least the end
of May.

Let us consider as fairly as possible the advan-
tages and disadvantages of Cairo and the Nile for
those in search of health.

The advantages are: (1) A dry and exhilarating
air which acts in itself as a tonic, and enables
visitors to be out-of-doors in_ sunshine the whole
day. (2) An almost complete absence of rain,
and of fog, and of clouded leaden skies. (3) The
absence of extreme cold, so that the invalid by
closing his windows at sunset need never breathe
air colder than 55° Fahr., even without any
adifieial heat. (4) The absence of strong winds
at Cairo and Luxor, though invalids occasionally

require special protection on the Nile. (5) The
interest and relaxation of mind inspired in a.
country where the remains may be studied of the
ancient Egyptians, Persiams, Greeks, Romans,
Arabs, and Turks. (G) The presence in a perfectly
oriental city of most available European luxuries,
and a, large and hospitable English society. (7)
The absence of moribund phthisieal patients, Who
find Egypt too far from home. (8) The facilities
for riding and driving, and for playing all outdoor
games.

The natives have a. proverb, "He who drinks
the waters of the Nile invariably returns to Egypt ; "
and in many instances this has seemed to be true,
for nearly all strangers develop in a few months
a great fondness for Cairo, and are grieved to
leave it ; while it can be honestly stated that most
invalids either improve in health while in Egypt,
or manfully hold their ground during their sojourn
there.

The objections to Egypt as a health-resort are:
(1) Its distance of sis days or more from England,
and of at least three days from the south of Europe,
so that a sea-voyage is unavoidable. (2) The ex-
pense which naturally attends such a journey, the
cost of hotels and pensions in Cairo, and the extra
cost of a. journey up the Nile. (3) The mosquitoes,
which welcome young women and children very

irritatingly, until they get used to mosquito-nets.
(4) A certain monotony at the dinner-table of
buteher's meat,poultry, and game. (5) The insani-
tary condition of the picturesque old parts of
Cairo.

The climate of Egypt is, then, suitable during
the winter months for a great variety of chronic
ailments, among which may be 1neutioued-eow
valeseence from pneumonia, fevers, and all acute
diseases; that common delicacy of English youth
which may be called "threatened pUhisis," all
cases of early phthisis, and all quiescent cases of
the late forms of the disease; chronic bronchitis
and emphysema; bronchial, catarrhal, and spas-
modic asthma; chronic catanhal affections of the
larynx and pharynx, including "clergyman's sore
throat;" rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, and
gout in its various forms; heart-disease, and all
other complaints which prevent a patient from
walking or other active exercise; anaemia and
chlorosis; exhaustion of nervous system from too
great excitement, worry, business, or study, and
sleeplessness 01' hypoehoudria; neuralgia, hysteria
and its accompanying dyspepsia; diseases of spinal
cord, locomotor ataxy, ete.; chronic kidney-dis-
ease; and the very large class of people without
organic disease, who sluivel up sadly in a cold
climate, and expand joyously in a sunny atmo-

sphere where they are not perpetually reminded
of their sensitiveness to cold and to 'Uaking cold."
This last group includes those iuvalided home from
India for malaria and other causes.

Cases of all these ailments have passed satis-
factorily under the 1vriier's observation during the
last six winters.

But the most important question to try and
solve is what kind of patients ought not to be sent
to E gypt.

My personal opinion is that all cases of very
advanced or rapidly advancing phthisis of both
lungs would be better at or near home, unless the
patients themselves express a decided preference
for ending their days in a distant land. The
friends of such patients often need to be reminded
that mere change of climate will not cure the
disease, but that wherever the sick man goes, he
will undoubtedly take his disease with him.

Again, patients with dropsy and all the trouble-
some sequelae of heart-disease are surely unwise
to give up all their home-comforts and surround-
ings, unless their minds are wholly set upon
going to a. certain spot, and it seems cruel to pre-
vent their carrying out the wish of their heart;
but even then it is almost necessary that they
should be accompanied by a trained nurse. A
hot climate is perhaps too exciting for men with

a tendency to apoplesy; but the sun at Cairo is
not powerful till April, and then a helmet is suffi-
cient protection.

Former writers have said that phthisis with a
tendency to hzemorrhage should not be sent to
Egypt; but I see no reason why they should not
winter in Egypt, provided they exchange the undue
stimulation of Cairo "lrhamseens" in April for
the sea-breezes of Ramleh.

Phthisical patients with a previous history of
haemoptysis do not usually suffer from haemorrhage
in Egypt, and, moreover, it is not a common
symptom in the eases of phthisis which one sees
among the ncgroes and other natives of the
country.

Oufjit and Clothinr--Let us bake this oppor-
tunity of telling our countrymen, and especially
our countrywomen, that it is no longer necessary
to buy from the Outfitter. the travelling kit which
is based on patterns at least forty years old. Dust-
cloaks, helmets, blue veils, goggles, pugries, and
field-glasses are not becoming, and are not needful
for walking or driving in Cairo. Let the visitor
bring such clothing as he wears in England in the
summer and autumn, and he will want little else
beside. Flannel belts to be worn next to the skin
are of great assistance in preventing attacks of
diarrhoea. Helmets for wearing up the Nile can

be bought in Cairo. Pugries may be twisted
around them, but it is of no use to wear streaming
tails of coloured calico to protect the neck. If a.
helmet is objected io--and indeed few ladies look
well in it-a 11erai hat is the best substitute; but
straw hats may be worn during the cohler months.
Flannel suits are always comfortable, and brown
leather boots and shoes are commended to both
sexes. Wire gauze goggles should be bought in
England to protect delicate eyes from the glare of
the sun and from saudstorms. Ladies who desire
to ride must bring their habits, and Will be more
independent if they bring a saddle. Warm cloaks
and rugs are wanted in December and January,
and on the river always at night. Eeating's
powder " Persian powder is wanted for insects.
Patent English or foreign medicines should be
brought by the invalid if required, though the local
druggists provide the public with the most com-
monly asked-for specialities. White umbrellas and
all common requisites wan be bought in Cairo.

Ladies may be glad of the hint that silk or silk
and wool combination garments are preferable to

Routes to J'Jyypt.-Those who are not afraid of
the sea can leave London by I'. and O. steamers,
or British India OI' Orient Line, and they will
reach Ismailia in twelve days by paying £20.

Robust people who are not dependent upon the
presence of a doctor and stewardess can economize
by travelling from Liverpool to Alexandria by the
Moss or Papayanni lines. For those who are not
martyrs to sea-sickness, and to the general dis-
comfort of life on board ship, there is no doubt
that the sea-voyage is very healthy, very restful,
and useful in gradually aecustomi11g, patients to
change of climate.

Visitors who desire as little of the sea as possible
must make their way to Brindisi, and then on to
Alexandria by P. and O. or Austrian Lloyd; ot'
from Trieste to Alexandria by Austrian Lloyd; or
from Genoa or Naples by Eubattiuo to Alexandria;
or from Marseilles to Alexandria by the Messagerios
steamers.

The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes
three days and a half, and the whole journey from
London to Cairo can be done any week in less
than six days, at about the same expense as the
long sea routes. Generally, is may be said, an
English-speaking invalid is more comfortable on
an English steamer, and it mash be remembered
that the large vessels which go on to India, China,
and Australia, are often more luxurious than the
smaller steamers which run only between Europe
and Egypt. On the other hand, invalids must be
warned that it is easier for them to land at

Alexandria than at Ismailia, because they may be
obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and
then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the
early morning. Moreover, two trains run from
Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-opo'arter
hours, while from Ismailia to Cairo there is only
one passenger train in the day, occupying four and
three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any
custom-house diff1eulty for personal baggage, and
no passport is necessary.

Proposed itinerary-Delicate patients should
leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so
as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some
remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the
Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return
to Cairo at the end of February. In April they
should go to Bamleh, and thence perhaps to Italy
and the south of France, arranging not to reach
England or other cold climates till the very end of
May.
