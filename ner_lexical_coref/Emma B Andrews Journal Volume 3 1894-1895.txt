Theodore	PERSON
lost	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cigarettes	O

and	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
saved	O
his	O
boxes	O

They	O
dove	O
to	O
the	O

hauled	O
out	O
my	O

of	O
homeopathic	O
medicines	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
solemn	O
pow-wow	O
over	O
it	O

Then	O
they	O
seized	O
my	O
camera	O
that	O
Jones	PERSON
was	O
carrying	O
--	O
insisted	O
on	O
having	O
the	O
case	O
opened	O

and	O
were	O
too	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
taking	O
out	O
the	O
camera	O
themselves	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
out	O

took	O
off	O

pointed	O
the	O

they	O
hurriedly	O

Then	O
they	O
fell	O
upon	O
a	O

little	O
basket	O
I	O
was	O
carrying	O

filled	O
with	O
my	O
various	O

drew	O
all	O

them	O
out	O

came	O
upon	O
a	O

over	O

as	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
something	O
good	O
to	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O

would	O
try	O
it	O

I	O
would	O
gladly	O

sacrificed	O

The	O

a	O

However	O
we	O
had	O
more	O
than	O
15	O
minutes	O
,	O
so	O
our	O
luggage	O
was	O
scuttled	O
into	O
the	O
booking	O
office	O

where	O
to	O
our	O
consternation	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
never	O

so	O

Nothing	O
would	O
move	O
them	O

we	O
stood	O

indignantly	O
at	O
our	O
train	O

until	O
it	O
moved	O
off	O

Madrid	LOCATION

We	O
said	O
some	O
bad	O

commented	O
satirically	O
on	O
the	O
method	O
of	O

wounded	O

so	O
,	O
making	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
drove	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
stayed	O
day	O
7	O
years	O

the	O

walked	O
to	O

the	O

we	O

The	O

had	O
only	O

Then	O
we	O
went	O
to	O

The	O
next	O

we	O
drove	O

uncertain	O
whether	O

or	O
if	O

took	O

until	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O

where	O
we	O
sat	O
for	O
an	O

he	O

Theodore	PERSON
talking	O
about	O

he	O
showed	O

a	O

that	O
he	O

taken	O
of	O
the	O

Then	O
we	O
went	O
out	O
to	O
the	O

which	O
extends	O
some	O

and	O
found	O
that	O
some	O

take	O
us	O

So	O
we	O
waded	O
in	O
some	O

ankle	O
deep	O
in	O
water	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
plumped	O

Started	O
out	O
this	O
morning	O
at	O
7:30	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
wind	O
--	O
which	O
held	O
until	O
about	O
11	O

when	O
it	O
failed	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
as	O
we	O
drew	O
near	O
Keneh	LOCATION
,	O
we	O
debated	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
ashore	O
and	O
find	O
our	O
antiquity	O

two	O

we	O
decided	O
not	O
to	O
stop	O

and	O
the	O
wind	O
increasing	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
turn	O
below	O

the	O
river	O
her	O
turning	O
quite	O
sharply	O

once	O

We	O
careered	O
along	O
in	O
a	O
beautiful	O
manner	O

the	O

so	O
high	O
as	O

almost	O

I	O

spent	O

principally	O
at	O
Mohammed	PERSON

in	O

grew	O

Two	O

this	O

a	O
fair	O
little	O

sprang	O
up	O

Theodore	PERSON
gave	O
orders	O

it	O
soon	O
failed	O

we	O

to	O

We	O
had	O
all	O

We	O
have	O
had	O
quite	O
an	O

experience	O
this	O
afternoon	O

The	O
men	O
were	O

we	O
were	O
slowly	O

Theodore	PERSON

I	O

I	O

talking	O
above	O

so	O
much	O

that	O
Theodore	PERSON
called	O
up	O

always	O
on	O

know	O
what	O
the	O

he	O
did	O
not	O
wait	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
but	O
seized	O
a	O
stout	O
stick	O
,	O
called	O
out	O
to	O

I	O
hustled	O

up	O
on	O

just	O

The	O

plunged	O
after	O
,	O
beating	O
him	O
unmercifully	O

I	O
flew	O
down	O
the	O
companionway	O
to	O
Selim	PERSON
,	O
the	O
cook	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
to	O
tell	O
Hassan	PERSON

Ali	PERSON
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
such	O

that	O

were	O
guilty	O
the	O
sheik	O
of	O
the	O
village	O
would	O
punish	O
them	O

but	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
beat	O
them	O

Then	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
brought	O
on	O

as	O
prisoners	O

and	O
I	O
told	O
Selim	PERSON
to	O
protect	O
them	O
from	O
violence	O
until	O
we	O
knew	O
what	O
the	O
trouble	O
was	O

A	O
moment	O
after	O
the	O
uproar	O
grew	O
nearer	O
,	O
and	O
swarming	O
over	O
the	O
bank	O
came	O
our	O
people	O

followed	O
by	O
a	O
crowd	O
of	O
women	O
and	O
children	O

but	O
no	O
men	O

These	O
women	O
began	O
shrieking	O
more	O
wildly	O
than	O
ever	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
our	O
two	O
prisoners	O
--	O
they	O
threw	O
dust	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
danced	O
about	O
like	O
wild	O
savages	O
.	O

Order	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
cast	O
off	O
at	O
once	O

and	O
a	O
favorable	O

having	O

up	O

we	O
were	O

get	O
out	O

They	O
all	O
followed	O
along	O
the	O

making	O
all	O
the	O
noise	O
they	O
could	O
and	O
they	O
must	O

some	O

on	O
two	O

near	O

when	O
we	O

up	O

we	O
found	O
two	O

In	O
the	O

when	O
our	O

came	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O

it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
Captain	O
had	O
a	O
cruel	O
cut	O
on	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
bleeding	O
profusely	O
,	O
and	O
Moussa	PERSON
looked	O
as	O

been	O
nearly	O

he	O
head	O
cut	O
open	O
in	O

Ibraim	PERSON
also	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
cut	O
on	O
his	O

They	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
perfect	O
rage	O
--	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
that	O
Nettie	PERSON
and	O
I	O
and	O
Jones	PERSON
could	O
do	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
quiet	O

to	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
landed	O
and	O
the	O
officers	O
had	O
come	O
on	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
solemn	O
hearing	O

except	O
when	O
the	O
excitement	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
Reis	PERSON
broke	O
out	O

A	O
huge	O
audience	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O

the	O
broken	O
heads	O
were	O
exhibited	O

and	O
a	O
man	O
came	O
on	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

to	O
show	O
a	O

Our	O
dignified	O
Selim	PERSON
was	O
summoned	O
from	O
his	O

,	O
and	O
acted	O
as	O
interpreter	O
and	O
then	O
Theodore	PERSON
called	O
for	O
our	O
second	O
captain	O

our	O
favorite	O
Reis	PERSON
Fuli	PERSON
to	O
give	O
his	O

which	O
he	O
did	O
in	O
so	O
calm	O

and	O
perfect	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sight	O
to	O
see	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
crowd	O
of	O
angry	O
savages	O

Reis	PERSON
Mohammed	PERSON
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Luxor	LOCATION
,	O
as	O
the	O
officers	O
suggested	O
,	O
to	O
enter	O
his	O
complain	O
--	O
but	O
Theodore	PERSON
announced	O
very	O
decidedly	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
had	O
trouble	O
and	O
detention	O
enough	O
--	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
wait	O
no	O
longer	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
was	O
excellent	O
--	O
until	O
they	O
took	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
--	O
whom	O
they	O
hustled	O
about	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
undignified	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
severe	O
--	O
their	O
turbans	O
being	O
torn	O
from	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
unwound	O
and	O
used	O
as	O
fetters	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
quite	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
with	O
a	O
long	O
wound	O
or	O
gash	O
in	O
his	O
leg	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
tempted	O
to	O
tell	O
Jones	PERSON
to	O
go	O
and	O
dress	O
it	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
'm	O
afraid	O
our	O
crew	O
would	O
almost	O
have	O
mobbed	O
him	O
--	O
that	O
being	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
grace	O
to	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
far	O
from	O
their	O
comprehension	O
.	O

Finally	O
we	O
got	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
all	O
behind	O
us	O
--	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
different	O
incidents	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
only	O
one	O

with	O
the	O

in	O

on	O

Theodore	PERSON
unceremoniously	O
took	O
the	O

from	O
him	O

ordered	O
him	O
back	O
to	O

that	O

the	O

at	O

so	O

the	O

lunching	O
at	O

So	O
we	O
had	O
ours	O
far	O
off	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
colonnades	O
--	O
almost	O
exactly	O
in	O
the	O
pot	O
from	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Newman	PERSON
's	O
picture	O
that	O
Theodore	PERSON
has	O
was	O
painted	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
making	O
our	O
way	O
over	O
there	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
little	O
Yema	LOCATION
coming	O
and	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
Theodore	PERSON
,	O
``	O
do	O
n't	O
ay	O
anything	O

I	O
want	O
to	O

me	O
''	O

He	O
looked	O
at	O
me	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
threw	O
out	O
both	O
hands	O
with	O
an	O
exclamation	O
that	O
was	O
quite	O
tragic	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
cry	O
of	O
joy	O
rushed	O
forward	O
to	O
see	O
me	O

Very	O
little	O
grown	O
--	O
the	O

sweet	O
,	O
appealing	O
little	O
fellow	O
--	O
he	O
stuck	O
closely	O
by	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

Then	O
we	O
asked	O
for	O
``	O
Dendowi	O
''	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
shortly	O
produced	O
--	O
looking	O
more	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
,	O
brown	O
reproduction	O
of	O
Queen	O
Victoria	PERSON
than	O
ever	O
--	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
imperturbable	O
dignity	O
--	O
Philae	O
seemed	O
more	O
lovely	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
interesting	O
than	O
ever	O
--	O
I	O
suppose	O
because	O
its	O
doom	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
pronounced	O

We	O
could	O
see	O
on	O
the	O
walls	O
of	O
Pharaoh	O

coloured	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
Newman	PERSON

as	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
equal	O
to	O

down	O

their	O
dahabeah	O

and	O
I	O
wanted	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
her	O
about	O
Yemma	PERSON

Theodore	PERSON
saw	O
them	O
for	O
a	O
few	O

in	O
the	O
temple	O
--	O
but	O
with	O
many	O
people	O
about	O
them	O
--	O
Yemma	PERSON
told	O
me	O
Mrs.	O
Newman	PERSON
had	O
given	O
him	O
everything	O
he	O
had	O
on	O

and	O
proceeded	O
to	O
show	O
me	O
each	O
article	O

first	O
beginning	O
with	O
his	O
turban	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
already	O
remarked	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
impressive	O
.	O

This	O
he	O
took	O
off	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
unwound	O
,	O
showing	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
drawers	O

which	O
he	O
put	O
on	O

after	O
discreetly	O

The	O
descent	O
of	O
the	O

too	O

seemed	O
more	O
exciting	O
than	O
ever	O

We	O
passed	O
the	O

And	O
we	O
have	O

coming	O
in	O
after	O

the	O

I	O

one	O

who	O
was	O
a	O

as	O

with	O
the	O

I	O

the	O
wheat	O

although	O
she	O
never	O

worn	O
anything	O
so	O
thick	O

she	O
persisted	O

We	O
had	O
them	O
on	O

to	O
their	O
great	O

gave	O
them	O
some	O

to	O
carry	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
--	O
the	O
older	O

was	O
remarkably	O
pretty	O

with	O
perfect	O
teeth	O

and	O
the	O
sweetest	O
smile	O
and	O
her	O
delight	O
in	O
everything	O
she	O
saw	O

was	O

She	O
patted	O
the	O

the	O
