a	O
most	O
disgusting	O
and	O
horrible	O
monster	O
on	O
the	O
mosquito	O

to	O
my	O

a	O

in	O

Page	O

with	O
2	O
enormously	O

he	O
waved	O
them	O
at	O

threw	O
their	O

on	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

manner	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Theodore	PERSON

Nettie	PERSON
for	O
assistance	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
tried	O
to	O
bag	O
the	O
creature	O
with	O
no	O
success	O

he	O
dropped	O
on	O

we	O
could	O

So	O
Theodore	PERSON
nobly	O
proposed	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
occupy	O
his	O

he	O
would	O

I	O
was	O

This	O

on	O

he	O

that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
looked	O
into	O
at	O

and	O
soon	O
had	O
the	O

about	O

to	O

who	O
had	O

themselves	O

who	O
I	O

cock	O
was	O
in	O

he	O
grew	O
more	O

furious	O
as	O
two	O

three	O

cocks	O
began	O
to	O
wander	O
about	O

the	O

had	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
home	O
again	O

again	O
after	O
his	O
furious	O
excursions	O

Indeed	O
she	O
was	O
most	O
faithful	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
every	O
way	O

did	O
not	O
at	O

off	O

We	O
made	O
ourselves	O
as	O

refrained	O
from	O

Back	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

we	O

along	O
through	O
the	O

of	O

wonderful	O

and	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O

as	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
stronger	O
currents	O
,	O
and	O
pulled	O
finely	O
around	O

corners	O

and	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O
great	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
at	O

doing	O
the	O
thing	O
I	O

fastened	O
the	O

to	O

began	O
to	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
tremendous	O
hubbub	O
from	O
the	O
first	O
-	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
wonder	O
was	O
that	O
any	O

could	O
be	O

-	O
but	O
now	O

the	O

there	O

a	O

the	O

the	O

back	O

and	O
snatched	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
steersman	O
-	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
our	O

was	O
rapidly	O
approaching	O
a	O
jagged	O
point	O
of	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
Theodore	PERSON
sprang	O
up	O
with	O

our	O

added	O
their	O

too	O

Then	O
there	O
was	O
dire	O
confusion	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
seconds	O
-	O
I	O
saw	O
our	O

Jones	PERSON
went	O
in	O

showed	O
the	O

how	O

All	O

until	O
they	O

when	O

So	O
Theodore	PERSON
ordered	O
the	O

strongly	O

her	O

up	O

for	O
even	O

we	O

that	O

there	O
was	O
certainly	O
a	O
charm	O
in	O
our	O
unusual	O
situation	O
in	O
that	O
waste	O

as	O
the	O

the	O

broken	O
by	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
this	O
morning	O
when	O
one	O
of	O

knocked	O
at	O
my	O
door	O

tell	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
half	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
asleep	O
more	O
than	O
half	O
an	O

I	O
climbed	O
down	O
from	O
my	O

very	O
quietly	O
and	O
pushed	O
open	O
my	O
window	O
which	O

talking	O
to	O
Theodore	PERSON
who	O
had	O
his	O

out	O

They	O
pointed	O
out	O
the	O
Cross	ORGANIZATION

here	O
much	O
foreshortened	O
and	O
as	O
it	O

in	O

is	O
somewhat	O

Then	O
I	O
closed	O
my	O
window	O
for	O
the	O
morning	O
was	O
very	O
cold	O

and	O
climbed	O
again	O
into	O
my	O
high	O

intending	O
to	O
get	O
up	O

It	O
was	O
hardly	O
more	O
than	O
5	O

when	O
I	O
again	O
got	O
up	O

opened	O

out	O
upon	O
one	O

Theodore	PERSON

Howard	PERSON
stayed	O

they	O

when	O

went	O
away	O

The	O
mother	O
was	O
a	O
clean	O

very	O

I	O
was	O
a	O

her	O
hair	O
in	O
the	O
tiny	O
Nubian	O

which	O
are	O
so	O

She	O
is	O
the	O

but	O
the	O

descended	O
upon	O
that	O

the	O

a	O
few	O
years	O

and	O
destroyed	O

Many	O

he	O

then	O
we	O
five	O

we	O
being	O
totally	O

we	O
laughed	O
a	O
great	O

and	O
showed	O
them	O
our	O

I	O
think	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
amused	O
with	O

the	O

In	O

We	O
started	O
early	O
this	O

but	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
so	O
violent	O
we	O
tied	O
up	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O
high	O
bank	O
for	O
4	O
hours	O

stretched	O
to	O

us	O
from	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
delicious	O
pure	O
air	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
it	O
so	O
life-giving	O
that	O
I	O
stayed	O
on	O
deck	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

Theodore	PERSON

we	O
brought	O
a	O
nice	O

little	O
fellow	O
along	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
boat	O

I	O
was	O
pleased	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
released	O
from	O
captivity	O
as	O
we	O
drew	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
called	O
below	O
to	O
luncheon	O

I	O
left	O
him	O
merrily	O
nibbling	O
at	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
on	O

again	O
immediately	O
after	O
luncheon	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
horror	O
way	O
his	O
brown	O

stretched	O
to	O
dry	O
almost	O
on	O
the	O

I	O

We	O
moved	O
away	O
late	O
this	O
afternoon	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
wind	O
lulled	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
got	O
well	O
out	O
into	O
the	O

when	O
it	O
was	O

The	O

I	O
was	O
so	O

with	O
it	O

that	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
overrated	O
it	O

but	O
there	O
is	O
the	O

charm	O
about	O
it	O

which	O
though	O
rather	O
difficult	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
words	O
,	O
is	O
none	O
the	O
less	O
potent	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
venture	O
to	O
attempt	O
explanation	O
of	O
the	O
mystery	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
if	O
we	O
cultivated	O
our	O
spiritual	O

more	O
assiduously	O
we	O
might	O
bridge	O
over	O

These	O

took	O
such	O
pleasure	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
such	O
reverence	O

They	O
made	O
