The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end system for parsing historical documents pertaining to the Emma B. Andrews Diary Project. The system has three components: OCR, named entity recognition and normalization, and XML generation. Additionally, there are two user interfaces. The first is to aid the user in running OCR and correcting any mistakes. The second is to aid in named entity recognition and XML markup.
