               provides a vital commentary on the archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific literati in
               <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>
               at the dawn of the twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden Age' of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website. The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook Digital Texts. We are proud to offer undergraduate and graduate Digital Humanities education and internships.

            <p>We left home by Fall River boat, and reached <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> the next morning.  I did some shopping that day, went to the theatre to hear an amusing play of ‘Bunty pulls the strings’ a Scotch play, given by Scotch actors, and much in vogue now.  <persName ref="#">Chilton Powell</persName> dined  with us and saw the play with us - and <persName ref="#">Mary Newberry</persName> and <persName ref="#">Anita</persName> were with us - both stopping at the <placeName ref="#">Holland</placeName> with us.</p>

            <p>Sailed this morning for <orgName ref="#">Genoa</orgName> - where we will wait 15 days for our boat for <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName>.  Have my old appartment which is the Captain’s, and very commodious and comfortable, and which I occupied two years ago.  We know a few of the passengers.  The 4 days we passed in <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> were dismal in the extreme - it rained all the time, I took a severe cold, and did not go out of the house after the first day - and had to cancel a long standing engagement to drive with the <persName ref="#">Fairfield Osborns</persName>, who had invited a lot of pleasant people to meet us. It was altogether a great piece of disappointment, that visit in <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Arrived on a cold, damp morning - came to the Hotel Miramare</p>

               which had been recommended to us.  Until we passed the <placeName ref="#">Azores</placeName>, we had a fairly good passage - though warm and misty - after that to <placeName ref="#">Gibraltar</placeName> bright weather, but tremendous rolling - slow but very disconcerting.  After leaving <placeName ref="#">Gibraltar</placeName> we began a hustle with the <placeName ref="#">Mediterranean</placeName>, and we were cruelly battered about - could not make the landing at <placeName ref="#">Algiers</placeName> and the little mail boat that came out to us, on returning lost her Captain and one sailor.  We find this hotel the most delightful one we have ever known - large airy appartments, with every luxury - perfect service - and food.  My corner room is the most charming room I have ever seen - and the large sitting room next it is the same - and the string of bedrooms next the salon, made an imposing array.  <persName ref="#">David Costantini</persName> arrived for a few days and <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName> met us at the steamer and stayed the night, going back to <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName> and coming with the girls, <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Mary Buttles</persName> for a week before the steamer sailed.  We motored a good deal along that lovely coast, and it would have been delightful had the roads been good and the motors comfortable.  We were all glad when the <persName ref="#">Prinz Heinrich</persName> arrived and took us off for <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName> on the 18th.  I was really tired of that wide view from our windows of the Miramare which stands high, but rather close to that busy port.  We arrived at <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName> on the
               <date When="1911-11-21 00:00:00">21st, Nov.</date>
               having again been cruelly buffetted by that merciless <placeName ref="#">Mediterranean</placeName>. Arrived in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> at 9:20 and were immediately installed in our old pleasant appartment, looking on the garden, which we have occupied for several years.

            <p>We came on the Beduin this afternoon to stay, and were indeed happy to take up this enchanting life again. Everything was in order, and  we were soon settled.   <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> left  for <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> today.  We had a pleasant week in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> - saw many of our old friends. Judge <persName ref="#">Alston</persName> and his wife lunched with us on the boat, Capt. <persName ref="#">Trefusis</persName> and his wife lunched another day.</p>

We went on Friday to the commencement exercises at the <orgName ref="#">Mission School</orgName> - remarkable and interesting.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> tremendously impressed.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> to breakfast - and on Saturday we drove out to Mr. <persName ref="#">Carters</persName> for tea and saw his paintings.  The girls had not seen his pictures for 5 years, and thought he had advanced enormously.  Among them was the one I ordered last year.  Three delicious little girls from the tomb of <persName ref="#">Menna</persName> in the Sheik Abu el <placeName ref="#">Negga</placeName>.  I am delighted with them.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Whymper</persName> lunched with us before we went.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> came back from the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this afternoon.</p>

The girls much amused with the show in the evening. The next morning the girls went to the Museum, and I stayed at home</p>

Mr. <persName ref="#">Whymper</persName> came to lunch - and in the afternoon Mrs. <persName ref="#">Wheelright</persName> and her daughter from the <placeName ref="#">Thames</placeName> were here to tea.

            <p>We had the boat dressed in all its colors in honor of <placeName ref="#">Washington</placeName>’s birthday - and it made a very pretty sight.  I have spent most of the day writing letters etc.  Contessa de Contardone and <persName ref="#">M. Rodier</persName> were here for tea - a pleasant and amusing visit.</p>

            <p>I have been greatly worried about <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> for some days, she has seemed so unlike herself - and about a week ago we sent for Dr. <persName ref="#">Dunn</persName> - whom she did not like at all - and after the 4th visit declined seeing him again.  Fortunately Mrs. <persName ref="#">Wheelright</persName> who is on the <placeName ref="#">Thames</placeName> near us, has a Dr. <persName ref="#">Augusta Williams</persName> with her, who is at the head of <orgName ref="#">Vincent Hospital</orgName> in <placeName ref="#">Boston</placeName> - and who offered her services at once.  She brought <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> around at once, and was so charming and cheery a person, that we all lost our hearts to her.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> seemed to have a touch of Drugue fever, with severe pains all over her.  We have decided to go up as far as <persName ref="#">Abu Simbel</persName>.  I hardly think it wise at this time of the year, but we want to see it, under its new manifestation.  <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName> is going with us, and we have to give him <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName>’s room - and leave her behind - we will have a tug and start on the 3rd.</p>

            <p>arriving at <placeName ref="#">Abu Simbel</placeName> on the 10th day - very busy winds, and very uncomfortably warm.  The sand was blowing about us - and as it was quite a walk over to the Temple, we waited for the morning to visit it, and made a call on the <orgName ref="#">Newmans</orgName> instead.  The next morning we all, except <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName>, went up to the temple, <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> on a donkey, I carried in my chair, the rest walking.  Very interesting to see the change made by taking away those mountains of engulfing sand. The morning was too delicious, the scent of the crops - the larks singing everywhere, and all that strange, wild desolate, Nubian country.  Sailed away at 10 o’clock at last, turning our faces homeward - arrived back at <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName> at 5 o’clock P.M. and remained the night - the next day making 90 miles - arriving at <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> the following day about 3 o’clock.  While on the way up to <persName ref="#">Abu Simbel</persName>, I made a charming visit to Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Bird</persName>, on their desert island, which they have made to blossom like the rose.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Somers-Clarke</persName> designed and built their house which has as its foundation the great granite rocks of the cataract - and which is as solid as the rocks - and so well placed and designed. The garden covers the whole island - and is most interesting and charming.</p>

            <p>We have been here 11 days - and sail tomorrow on the <persName ref="#">Prinz Heinrich</persName> for <orgName ref="#">Genoa</orgName>, via <placeName ref="#">Corfu</placeName> - <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName>.  It is tiresome to make this long voyage.  It has been charming here - though we have been very quiet - and have done little visiting - and the last week we have been staying at the <placeName ref="#">Ghezireh Palace Hotel</placeName> with the usual charming rooms overlooking the <placeName ref="#">Garden</placeName> - Mrs. and Miss Coats are here as always - so pleasant to see from year to year.  She, Mrs. Coats such a placid type of a nice old English woman.  The girls have worked hard at sight seeing and visiting.  <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName> has been with us most of the time, and is going with us to <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>.  Weather not too warm.</p>

            <p><placeName ref="#">Genoa</placeName> - we had such a tiresome voyage.  It was interesting seeing <placeName ref="#">Corfu</placeName> again - but it added to the days.  The German Emperor was there at his Castle - and 3 great German Steamships in the harbour.  We reached <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> yesterday - but did not land - and here we are back in our old quarters at this best of hotels, the Mimare - which seems something like home.  Tomorrow we go to <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>.</p>

            <p><persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> elected to go by motor here - and we went by train - we expected them to arrive before we did, at 10 o’clock P.M.  But we passed them near <placeName ref="#">Spezia</placeName>, the rain pouring in torrents - and we thought they would stop somewhere for the night.  But they did not arrive</p>

            <p>until 12:30 - and <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> and I who were sitting up for them, were very anxious.  They had bad roads and continuous rain.  Our pleasure in being once more in <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>, was marred by an illness of <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>’s.  It began with an ulcerated tooth, which gave him extreme pain, but the dentist treated it, and we hoped it was over.  <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> was every day at the hotel with us, and <persName ref="#">David Costantini</persName> was very kind and devoted - and was with us almost every day, and motored and played cards with <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> - when the weather was good, which was seldom.  We had fires every day.  Pleasant visits with the <persName ref="#">Hagermeyer</persName>’s and with the Kirks - old Mrs. <persName ref="#">Kirk</persName> is very remarkable.  She is 86 years old and as active mentally and physically as ever, and very intelligent.  She rises very early, and works in her garden of which she is extravagantly  fond, and is now amusing herself in writing a history of her life.  It is a pleasure to meet her and talk to her.  We spent all afternoon with them, such a pleasant old Italian house just outside <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName> - we could only walk through part of it, as it was cold and windy.</p>
            <p>I only went into one church while here because of the cold, and <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and I went into <persName ref="#">S. Croce</persName>, my favourite Florentine church, one morning.  We were all devoted to <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> - in his wretched state - and the last day of our stay we went out to <persName ref="#">David Costantini</persName>’s beautiful house and had tea.  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Costantini</persName> was in <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName> - we are leaving on the 24th for <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName> for 3 or 4 days - and will go from there directly to <placeName ref="#">London</placeName>.</p>

            <p>We had 5 miserable days in <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName>.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> was so suffering.  We were as usual at that pleasant <persName ref="#">Cavour</persName>, and <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> went with us to see us off to <placeName ref="#">London</placeName>.  Theo fortunately found an excellent dentist - who came twice to see him each day.  He was so brave and patient - but the treatment was very heroic, and he is much pulled down by it - quite a comfortable ride to the <placeName ref="#">Calais</placeName> landing, and on Tuesday afternoon at 5 o’clock we reached <placeName ref="#">London</placeName>, and settled ourselves in our old pleasant appartment at <placeName ref="#">Bucklands</placeName>.</p>

            <p>We are finally off for home tomorrow, and will sail on the <persName ref="#">Kronprinzessen Cecèlia</persName>.  She usually makes the voyage in 5 days but as all the boats take a long southern course, to avoid possible ice, we will not reach <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> before Wednesday.  Theo still does not feel quite like himself, but has improved very much.  We have been very busy, visiting with our friends, shopping, etc.  But above all motoring over this beautiful country, we have the same motor we had last year, and <persName ref="#">Bradford</persName> the excellent chauffeur - who verily I think knows all the roads in <placeName ref="#">England</placeName>.  <persName ref="#">Eleanor Knagenhjelm</persName> and <persName ref="#">Alice Wilson</persName> came from <placeName ref="#">Dresden</placeName> the day after we got here.  <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> goes home with us.  <persName ref="#">Eleanor</persName> was so very kind and devoted to her uncle, played bridge interminably with him, and was so useful and kind, and a great comfort.  Our greatest pleasure was going to the International Flower Show, held in <placeName ref="#">Chelsea Gardens</placeName> - a wonderful thing! Then we made a visit to <placeName ref="#">Guildford</placeName> to see</p>
