'''Naqada''' is a town on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in the [[Egypt]]ian governorate of [[Qena Governorate|Qena]]. It was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] as ''Nbwt'' and in [[classical antiquity]] as '''Ombos''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|ˌ|b|ɒ|s}}. Its name derives from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''nbw'', meaning ''[[Gold (hieroglyph)|gold]]'', on account of the proximity of gold mines in the [[Eastern Desert]].

==History==
Naqada comprises some villages such as Tukh, Khatara, Danfiq and Zawayda. It stands near the site of a [[necropolis]] from the prehistoric, [[Predynastic Egypt|pre-dynastic period]] around [[5th millennium BC|4400]]–3000 BC. Naqada has given its name to the widespread [[Naqada culture]], which existed at the time here and at other sites, including [[el Badari]], [[Gerzeh]] and [[Nekhen]] ([[Hierakonopolis]]). The large quantity of remains from Naqada have enabled the dating of the entire culture, throughout [[Egypt]] and environs.

The town was the centre of the cult of [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and large tombs were built there around c. 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Rice|first=|title=Egypt's Making: The Origins of Ancient Egypt 5000-2000 BC |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXZl03dabVYC&amp;pg=PA75 |edition=2nd|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=75|chapter=The Royal Power Centres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is one of few to have had a [[Copts in Egypt|Coptic]] majority in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Descrepancies Between Coptic Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kom_Ombo_Temple_Calendar.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The calendar shows the figures for the days of the month (roll over the picture) and the hieroglyphs for the inundation season [[Akhet (hieroglyph and season)|Akhet]].

The '''Temple of Kom Ombo''' is an unusual double [[Egyptian temple|temple]] in the town of [[Kom Ombo]] in [[Aswan Governorate]], [[Upper Egypt]]. It was constructed during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], 180–47 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egyptology, Facts on File, 1993. p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Some additions to it were later made during the Roman period. The building is unique because its 'double' design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;david99&quot;&gt;David, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god [[Sobek]], god of fertility and creator of the world with [[Hathor]] and [[Khonsu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;david99&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god [[Haroeris]], also known as [[Horus]] the Elder, along &quot;with [[Tasenetnofret]] (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnet/Tefnut&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;david99&quot; /&gt; The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.

The texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters invoked the gods of Ombos and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple. &lt;ref&gt;Gods and Men in Egypt 3000 BCE to 395 CE&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple was started by [[Ptolemy VI| Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemys, most notably [[Ptolemy XIII]] (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer [[hypostyle]] halls. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and &quot;probably represents a set of surgical instruments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;david99&quot; /&gt;A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Period. Little remains of the New Kingdom temple. 
&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Men in Egypt 3000 BCE to 395 CE&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the temple has been destroyed by the [[Nile]], earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by [[Copts]] who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by [[Jacques de Morgan]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;david99&quot; /&gt;

A few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.

'''Mendes''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μένδης}}, ''[[Genitive case|gen]]''.: Μένδητος), the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of the [[Ancient Egyptian]] city of '''Djedet''', also known in [[Ancient Egypt]] as [[Per (hieroglyph)|Per]]-'''Banebdjedet''' (&quot;The Domain of the Ram Lord of [[Djed]]et&quot;) and '''Anpet''', is known today as '''Tell El-Ruba''' ({{lang-ar|تل الربع}}).

The [[city]] is located in the eastern [[Nile delta]] ({{Coord|30|57|30|N|31|30|57|E|}}) and was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the 16th [[Lower Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Kha Nome|Kha]], until it was replaced by [[Thmuis]] in Greco-[[Roman Egypt]]. The two cities are only several hundred meters apart. During the [[Twenty-ninth dynasty of Egypt|29th dynasty]], Mendes was also the capital of Ancient Egypt, lying on the Mendesian branch of the [[Nile]] (now silted up), about 35&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Al Mansurah|al-Mansurah]].

==History==
{{Hiero | Djedet (ḏd.t) |  &lt;hiero&gt;Dd-d:t-niwt&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=left | era=egypt}}
In ancient times, Mendes was a famous city that attracted the notice of most ancient geographers and historians, including [[Herodotus]] (ii. 42, 46. 166), [[Diodorus]] (i. 84), [[Strabo]] (xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;802), [[Mela]] (i. 9 § 9), [[Pliny the Elder]] (v. 10. s. 12), [[Ptolemy]] (iv. 5. § 51), and [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (''s. v.''). The city was the capital of the [[Mendesian nome]], situated at the point where the Mendesian arm of the Nile ({{lang|grc|Μενδήσιον στόμα}}, [[Scylax]], p.&amp;nbsp;43; Ptol. iv, 5. § 10; ''Mendesium ostium'', Pliny, Mela, ''ll. cc.'') flows into the lake of [[Tanis]]. Archaeological evidence attests to the existence of the [[town]] at least as far back as the [[Naqada II]] period (4th millennium BCE). Under the first [[Pharaoh]]s, Mendes quickly became a strong seat of [[provincial government]] and remained so throughout the Ancient Egyptian period.  In [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] times, the nome it governed was one of the nomes assigned to that division of the native army which was called the ''[[Calasiris|Calasires]]'', and the city was celebrated for the manufacture of a [[perfume]] designated as the Mendesium [[unguentum]]. (Plin. xiii. 1. s. 2.) Mendes, however, declined early, and disappears in the first century AD; since both Ptolemy (''l. c.'') and [[P. Aelius Aristides]] (iii. p.&amp;nbsp;160) mention [[Thmuis]] as the only town of note in the Mendesian nome. From its position at the junction of the river and the lake, it was probably encroached upon by their waters, after the [[canal]]s fell into neglect under the [[Ptolemies|Macedonian kings]], and when they were repaired by [[Augustus]] ([[Suetonius|Sueton]]. ''Aug.'' 18, 63) Thmuis had attracted its [[trade]] and population.

==Religion==
[[File:Sophilos Mosaic from Thmuis.jpg|thumb|A [[mosaic]] from [[Thmuis]] (Mendes), Egypt, created by the [[Hellenistic art]]ist Sophilos (signature) in about 200 BC, now in the Greco-Roman Museum in Alexandria, Egypt; the woman depicted is the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Queen]] [[Berenike II]] (who ruled jointly with her husband [[Ptolemy III]]) as the personification of Alexandria, with her crown showing a ship's [[prow]], while she sports an [[anchor]]-shaped [[brooch]] for her [[Clothing in ancient Greece|robes]], symbols of the [[Ptolemaic Empire]]'s naval prowess and successes in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Joann (2008). ''Cleopatra the Great: The Woman Behind the Legend''. New York: Harper. ISBN 978-0-06-058558-7, image plates and captions between pp. 246-247.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The chief [[deities]] of Mendes were the [[Sheep|ram]] deity ''[[Banebdjedet]]'' (lit. ''Ba of the Lord of Djedet''), who was the [[Egyptian soul|Ba]] of [[Osiris]], and his [[wikt:consort|consort]], the fish goddess [[Hatmehit]]. With their child [[Har-pa-khered]] (&quot;[[Horus]] the Child&quot;), they formed the triad of Mendes.

The [[sheep|ram]] deity of Mendes was described by [[Herodotus]] in his ''History''&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, History, Book II, 42 ([[Robin Waterfield]] translation)&lt;/ref&gt; as being represented with the head and [[Wool|fleece]] of a [[goat]]: “...whereas anyone with a sanctuary of Mendes or who comes from the province of Mendes, will have nothing to do with ([[sacrifice|sacrificing]]) goats, but uses [[sheep]] as his sacrificial animals... They say that Heracles’ overriding desire was to see [[Zeus]], but Zeus was refusing to let him do so. Eventually, as a result of Heracles’ pleading, Zeus came up with a plan. He skinned a ram and cut off his head, then he held the head in front of himself, wore the fleece, and showed himself to Heracles like that. That is why the Egyptian statues of Zeus have a ram’s head, is why rams are sacred to the Thebans, and they do not use them as sacrificial animals.  However there is just one day of the year—the day of the [[festival of Zeus]]--when they chop up a single ram, skin it, dress the statue of Zeus in the way mentioned, and then bring the statue of Heracles up close to the statue of Zeus. Then everyone around the [[sanctuary]] mourns the death of the ram and finally they bury it in a sacred tomb.”

[[demonology|Demonologists]] in [[early modern times]] often imagined [[Satan]] as manifesting himself as a goat or [[satyr]], because goats had a reputation for lustful behavior and were used in the iconography of pre-Christian gods like [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the goat of Mendes. The occultist [[Eliphas Levi]] in his ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'' (1855) drew an image of the fictitious medieval idol [[Baphomet]] that conflated it with the goat of Mendes and the imagery of the Satanic satyr. The image of the satyr-like Baphomet and its supposed connection with Mendes has since been repeated by various occultists, conspiracy theorists, and [[neopagans]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pan en Egypte et le «bouc» de Mendès&quot; by Youri Volokhine, in Francesca Prescendi and Youri Volokhine, ''Dans le laboratoire de l'historien des religions: Mélanges offerts à Philippe Borgeaud''. Editions Labor et Fides, 2011, pp. 637–642, 646–647.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins==
[[File:Louvre 122007 58.jpg|thumb|[[Ushabti]] of pharaoh [[Hakor]], found at Mendes]]
The site is today the largest surviving [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] in the Nile delta, and consists of both Tell El-Ruba (the site of the main temple enclosure) and [[Tell El-Timai]] (the settlement site of Thmuis to the south). Overall, Mendes is about 3&amp;nbsp;km long from north to south and averages about 900m east-to-west. An [[Old Kingdom]] [[necropolis]] is estimated to contain over 9,000 [[interment]]s. Several campaigns of 20th-century excavations have been led by [[North America]]n institutions, including [[New York University]] and the [[University of Toronto]], as well as a [[Pennsylvania State University]] team led by [[Donald Redford]]. Under the direction of Prof. Redford, the current excavations are concentrating on a number of areas in and around the main [[temple]]. Work on the [[New Kingdom]] processional-style temple has recently uncovered foundation deposits of [[Merenptah]] below the second [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. It is thought that four separate pylons or gates existed for each of the [[Avatar]]s of the main deity worshiped here. Evidence has suggested that their construction dates from at least the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], as [[foundation deposit]]s were uncovered. The original structures were buried, added to, or incorporated into later ones over time by later rulers. [[Billy Morin]], recently at [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] and now at Leiden University in the Netherlands led a team that investigated these further and uncovered several mud-brick walls acting as pylons and their  foundations . Over thirty of the bricks were stamped with the [[cartouche]] of Menkheperre, the pre-nomen of [[Thutmose III]]. A [[cemetery]] of sacred rams was discovered in the northwest corner of Tell El-Ruba. Monuments bearing the names of [[Ramesses II]], Merneptah. and [[Ramesses III]] were also found. A temple attested by its foundation deposits was built by [[Amasis II]]. The tomb of [[Nepherites I]], which Donald Reford concluded was destroyed by the [[Achaemenids|Persians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redford | first = Donald | authorlink = Donald B.

On the edge of the [[temple mound]], a [[sondage]] supervised by [[Matthew J. Adams]] has revealed uninterrupted [[Stratification (archeology)|stratification]] from the Middle Kingdom down to the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]. Coring results suggest that future excavations in that sondage should expect to take the stratification down into the Buto-Maadi Period. The material excavated so far is already the longest uninterrupted stratification for all of the Nile Delta, and possibly for all of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;

{{about|the large ancient city in Lower Egypt|the city near the Egyptian Heliopolis|Leontopolis (Heliopolis)|other uses|Leontopolis (disambiguation)}}
'''Leontopolis''' was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city located in the [[Nile Delta]], [[Lower Egypt]]. It served as a provincial capital and Metropolitan Archbishopric, which remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]]. The archaeological site and settlement are known today as '''Kafr Al Muqdam'''.

== Name ==
Known most popularly in the modern era and to scholarship by its traditional [[Greek language|Greek]] name '''&quot;Leontopolis&quot;''' {{lang|grc|Λεόντων πόλις}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] iv. 5. § 51, [[Strabo]] xvii. pp. 802, 812&lt;/ref&gt; (literally, &quot;city of lions&quot;), or '''Leonto''' {{lang|grc|Λεοντώ}}, (&quot;lion&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Hieronym. ''ad Jovian.'' ii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; the demographic makeup of the city varied culturally and linguistically over its long history, and the Greek name was progressively used more and more over the native [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] '''Taremu '''(&quot;Land of Fish&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;GDG VI, 26; LÄ VI, 351&lt;/ref&gt; After the annexation of [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a [[Roman Egypt|Roman province]], the city retained the Greek name, and was referred to in [[Latin]] sources as the [[oppidum]] '''Leontos''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] v. 20. s. 17&lt;/ref&gt; though the Egyptian name still lingered among primary speakers of [[Coptic language|Coptic Egyptian]] into the [[post-classical history|post-classical period]]. Today, the site itself is referred to in [[Arabic]] as '''Tell el-Muqdam''' (&quot;mound of the city&quot;).

== History ==
[[File:Terzo periodo intermedio, fine XXII-inizio XV dinastia, rilievo di re iuput II, 754-715 ac ca. 02.JPG|thumb|Iuput II ruled over Leontopolis from 754 to 720/715 BCE]]
The city is located in the central part of the [[Nile Delta]] region. It was the capital of the 11th [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]] (the [[Ka-heseb|Leontopolite nome]]) and was probably the centre of [[pharaoh|pharaonic]] power under the [[twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt|23rd dynasty]].  In his conquest-stela found at the fourth Nile Cataract at [[Jebel Barkal]], [[Piye]] writes about his conquest over [[Iuput II]]. who ruled over Leontopolis.&lt;ref&gt;TUAT 1, 1985, 557ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] is the earliest writer who mentions either the nome, or its chief town: and it was probably of comparatively recent origin or importance.

The Greek name of this city means, &quot;City of Lions&quot;, given on account of the presence of temples to the lioness goddesses [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]] and [[Sekhmet]], and their son, [[Maahes]], the lion prince. Live lions were kept at the temples during the time of the Greek occupation.

It became the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Augustamnica Secunda]]

== Ecclesiastical history ==
As provincial capital it also was a Metropolitan archbishopric, known as '''Leontopolis in Augustamnica''', which was to fade.

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was restored nominally in the 18th century, as [[titular bishopric]], erroneously called '''Leontopolis in Bithynia''', and as such had the following incumbents of fitting episcopal (lowest) rank :
* Elias Daniel von Sommerfeld (1714.01.26 – 1742.07.26)
* Joaquim de Nossa Senhora de Nazareth Oliveira e Abreu, [[Friars Minor]] (O.F.M.) (1815.09.04 – 1819.08.23)
* Alexander Dobrzański (1819.12.17 – 1831?)
* Ludwig Forwerk (1854.07.11 – 1875.01.08)

It was promoted circa 1880 to [[titular archbishopric]] of Metropolitan rank; it was renamed in 1925 '''Leontopolis''', in 1933 '''Leontopolis in Augustamnica'''. It has had the following incumbents, of fitting (Metropolitan? archiepiscopal) rank :
* Jean-Pierre-François Laforce-Langevin (1891.02.06 – 1892.01.26)
* Dominique-Clément-Marie Soulé (1893.03.21 – 1919.04.21)
* Andrea Cassulo (1921.01.24 – 1952.01.09)
* Terence Bernard McGuire (1953.11.16 – 1957.07.04)
* Angelo Ficarra (1957.08.02 – 1959.06.01)
* Cornelius Bronsveld, [[White Fathers]] (M. Afr.) (1959.12.21 – 1970.11.30)

== The site ==
Antiquarians were long divided as to the real site of the ruins of Leontopolis. According to [[D'Anville]], they were covered by a mound called ''Tel-Essabè'' (Tel es-sab`), or the Lion's Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. [[Champollion]], ''l'Egypte'', vol. ii. p. 110, seq&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jomard]], on the other hand, maintains that some tumuli near the village of ''El-Mengaleh'' in the Delta, represent the ancient Leontopolis., And this supposition agrees better with the account of the town given by [[Xenophon of Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ephesiaca'', iv. p. 280, ed. Bipont&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]] sites the city at latitude 30° 6′North, which is considerably further south than the actual site.

Most scholars today {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} agree that Leontopolis is located at Tell al Muqdam, at latitude 30° 45′North.

'''El Hawawish''' ({{lang-ar|الحواويش}}) is the name given to the site of the ancient [[necropolis]] (cemetery) for the city of [[Akhmim]] in the [[Sohag Governorate]], [[Egypt]].

The cemetery was excavated extensively by an [[Australia]]n archaeological and epigraphic expedition under the auspices of the [[Australian Centre for Egyptology]] and [[Macquarie University]] and the direction of Professor [[Naguib Kanawati]].

'''Naucratis''' or '''Naukratis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ναύκρατις}}, &quot;Naval Victory&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=naukrat&amp;lang=greek &quot;Naukratis&quot;], ''Perseus Digital Library Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]:{{nbsp}}''Piemro'') was a city of [[Ancient Egypt]], on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] river, and 45&amp;nbsp;mi (72&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of the open sea and [[Alexandria]]. It was the first and, for much of its early history, the only permanent [[colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] in Egypt; it was a symbiotic nexus for the interchange of Greek and Egyptian art and culture.

The modern villages of Kom Gi’eif, el-Nibeira and el-Niqrash cover the archaeological site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kom Gi’eif (Naukratis)|url=https://egyptsites.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/kom-gieif-naukratis/|website=egyptian monuments|date=3 March 2009|author=Su}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become a find of the highest significance and the source of not only many beautiful objects of art now gracing the museums of the world but also an important source of some of the earliest Greek writing in existence, from the inscriptions on its pottery.

The sister port of Naucratis was the harbour town of Thonis/[[Heracleion]], which was undiscovered until 2000.

==Background==
Archaeological evidence suggests that the history of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] in Egypt dates back at least to [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times and more likely even further back into the proto-Greek [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] age. This history is strictly one of commerce as no permanent Greek settlements have been found of these cultures to date.

After the collapse of Mycenaean Greek civilization and the ensuing [[Greek dark ages]] (c1100 - 750&amp;nbsp;BC) a &quot;renaissance&quot; of Greek culture flourished in the 7th century BC and with it came renewed contact with the East and its two great river civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]] and the Nile.
[[File:Nile Delta - Naucratis.png|right|250px|thumb|Map indicating location of Naucratis-the Nile delta has shifted since ancient days; the city was situated directly on the Canopic (westernmost) branch.]]

The first report of Greeks in 7th century BC Egypt is a story in the [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] of [[Herodotus]] of [[Ionians|Ionian]] and [[Carians|Carian]] [[Piracy|pirates]] forced by storm to land on or near the [[Nile Delta]]. It relates the plight of the Saite Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I]] (Psamtik) (c. 664-610) of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]] overthrown and in desperation, seeking the advice of the [[Oracle]] of [[Leto]] at [[Buto]] who cryptically advises him to enlist the aid of &quot;brazen men&quot; who would &quot;come from the sea.&quot; Inspired upon seeing the bronze armor of the shipwrecked pirates, he offers them rewards in return for their aid in his campaign of return to power. Upon the success of this endeavor he makes good on his word and bestows on the mercenaries two parcels of land (or &quot;camps&quot; ''στρατόπεδα'') on either side of the Pelusian branch of the Nile.{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.152 2.152]}}

At present these sites remain uncertain but this may be a reference to the city of [[Daphnae]].

==History==

===Literary===

In 570&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Pharaoh]] [[Apries]] (Wahibre, reigned  589-570&amp;nbsp;BC) led the descendants of this mercenary army made up of 30,000 Carians and Ionians against a former general turned rebel by the name of Amasis. Although fighting valiantly they suffered defeat and [[Amasis II]] became Pharaoh (reigned 570-526&amp;nbsp;BC). Amasis shut down the &quot;camps&quot; and moved the Greek soldiers to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] where they were employed &quot;to guard him against the native [[Egyptians]].&quot;{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.154 2.154]}}

Herodotus: &quot;Amasis was partial to the Greeks, and among other favors which he granted them, gave to such as liked to settle in Egypt the city of Naucratis for their residence.&quot; Notice that he says &quot;gave the city (polis)&quot; which seems to indicate the existence (now borne out by archaeological evidence) of a &quot;city&quot; already there. This older city, settlement more likely, was no doubt small and inhabited by a mix of native Egyptians, Greeks and possibly even [[Phoenicians]]. Thus it seems the city was turned over to the Greeks, &quot;chartered&quot;, in the years immediately following 570&amp;nbsp;BC. The earlier date of c. 625&amp;nbsp;BC put forward by archaeologists may be the actual establishment of a settlement at the site.{{sfn|James|2003|p=258}}

Amasis indeed converted Naucratis into a major treaty-port and commercial link with the west. This was done most likely as a means to contain the Greeks and concentrate their activities in one place under his control. It became not the colony of any particular city-state but an [[Emporia (ancient Greece)|emporion]] (trading post)&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ng/naukratis_greeks_in_egypt/introduction/naukratis_a_city_and_port.aspx Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[Al Mina]], the largest market port of north [[Syria]].

According to Herodotus the walled shrine known as the ''Hellenion'' was a co-operative enterprise financed by nine eastern Greek cities:
*Four Ionian: [[Chios]], [[Klazomenai]], [[Teos]] and [[Phocaea]]
*Four [[Dorians|Dorian]]: [[Rhodes]], [[Halicarnassus]], [[Knidos]] and [[Phaselis]]
*One [[Aeolians|Aeolian]]: [[Mytilene]]
**[[Miletus]], [[Samos]] and [[Aegina]] had their own separate sanctuaries. Thus the natives of at least twelve Greek city-states worked in a collaboration that was not only rare but proved to be lasting.{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.178 2.178]}}

Naucratis later became an important center of Greek culture under the Roman Empire, producing several celebrated orators of the Second Sophistic in the second and early third centuries AD. The third century writer Athenaeus came from Naucratis.

===Archaeological===

The site was discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] who dug there in 1884-5. He was followed by [[Ernest Arthur Gardner]], and finally [[David George Hogarth]], in 1899 and 1903.

[[File:Petrie's sketch plan of Naucratis.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Petrie's sketch plan of Naucratis]]

The archaeological focus fell into two areas of northern and southern quarters. Found farthest south was a large Egyptian storehouse or treasury (A on sketch at right - originally identified by Petrie as the &quot;great [[temenos]]&quot;) and just north of that a Greek mudbrick Temple of Aphrodite roughly 14m. x 8m. (curiously not mentioned in Herodotus' list.) Directly east of this temple was unearthed a small factory for faience scarab seals.{{cref|i}}

In the northern section were found several temple ruins (E: Temple of Hera, F: Temple of Apollo &amp; G: Temple of Dioscuri) including what may be Herodotus' ''Hellenion'' discovered by Hogarth in 1899 (directly east of F.) &quot;None of the votive pottery found here need have arrived earlier than the reign of Amasis, so it may well be that the ''Hellenion'' was founded as the result of his reorganization of the status of Naucratis, while the independent sanctuaries... are of the earlier years of the town.&quot;{{sfn|Boardman|1980|pp=120–121}}

More recently American archaeologists W. Coulson and A. Leonard founded &quot;The Naucratis Project&quot; {{sfn|Leonard|Coulson|1982|p=361|ps=: &quot;The Naukratis Project, therefore, involves: 1) a program of excavation at Naukratis backed by an inter-disciplinary support staff. The primary objectives are the establishment of a stratigraphic sequence against which the results of earlier excavations at the site can be evaluated, and the creation of a typology for the ceramic material; 2) a survey of all ancient sites in the environs of Naukratis in order to assess the character of the visible remains, the state of site preservation, and the extent of modern encroachment caused by cultivation and settlement.&quot;}} in 1977 carrying out surveys in 1977–1978 and further surveys and excavations to the south of the site from 1980 to 1982 (under the auspices of the American Research Center in Egypt.)[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914074942/http://www.arce.org/aboutarce/aboutarce.html] Unfortunately they found the original northern sanctuary section submerged under a lake formed by the risen water table and roughly 15&amp;nbsp;meters deep.{{sfn|Leonard|Coulson|1979|p=154|ps=: &quot;On arriving at Naukratis the visitor may well be disappointed for the entire site of the early excavations is under water, a plight predicted by Petrie in 1886...&quot;}} This part of the site remains under water today making further work there difficult if not impossible.

Their assessment of the approach taken and methods used by their predecessors was less than complimentary. &quot;Unfortunately, much of the emphasis of the early excavators was placed on these religious structures at the expense of the commercial and domestic quarters. Consequently our knowledge of the mercantile character of ancient Naukratis - the very facet of its early history that made it so exceptional - has suffered greatly. Furthermore, the later historical sequences, such as the Hellenistic and Roman periods, were almost totally neglected.&quot;{{sfn|Leonard|Coulson|1979|p=153}}

Also discouraging to them was the destruction wrought by the local populace on the site. &quot;Already in Petrie's day about a third of the halfmile
by quarter-mile site of Naukratis had been dug away by the local farmers for use as high-phosphate fertilizer (''sebakh'') in their fields&quot; and &quot;In the intervening 100&amp;nbsp;years or so, the ''sebakhin'' have totally destroyed this eastern portion of the site.&quot;{{sfn|Leonard|Coulson|1979|p=159}}

The barrier of the high water table made it impossible for them to find anything older than the Ptolmaic era. They agreed with Hogarth that the &quot;great temenos&quot; of Petrie was actually an Egyptian building and that indeed the entire south section of the town appeared to be non-Greek.{{sfn|Leonard|1997|p=14}}

Overall most of the finds were vases (some whole, most fragmentary) used as votives in the temples, but also stone statuettes and scarab seals. These are scattered to museums and collections around the world, the earlier material largely brought to Britain (mostly in the British Museum) and the later to the Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria.

==Impact==
The Egyptians supplied the Greeks with mostly [[grain]] but also [[linen]] and [[papyrus]] while the Greeks bartered mostly [[silver]] but also [[timber]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]].{{cref|ii}} Naukratis, and the associated Greek &quot;forts&quot; in the general delta area, as demonstrated by accounts given above, became a ready source of mercenary fighting men for the Saite pharaohs, men with superior [[hoplite]] armor and tactics, and also possessing invaluable naval expertise.

Naucratis soon became a profound source of inspiration to the Greeks by re-exposing them to the wonders of Egyptian architecture and sculpture lost to them since the [[Bronze Age]]. Egyptian artifacts soon began their flow along the Greek trade routes finding their way into the homes and workshops of the Ionian Greek world and, via [[Aegina]], the city-states of mainland Greece. Although Greek art and ideas in turn came back the other way their absorption into a largely [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] Egyptian culture was strictly minimal.{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.79 2.79]|ps=: &quot;The Egyptians adhere to their own national customs, and adopt no foreign usages.&quot;}}{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.91 2.91]|ps=: &quot;The Egyptians are adverse to adopt Greek customs, or, in a word, those of any other nation.&quot;}}

Although Herodotus claimed that [[geometry]] (γεωμετρία) was first known in Egypt and then passed into Greece{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.109 2.109]}} it is now generally accepted by scholars that what the Greeks learned were more like &quot;surveying techniques&quot; and hardly deserve the designation &quot;geometry&quot; in the sense of a purely intellectual mathematical practice. Indeed, Greeks like [[Thales]] were already accomplished geometricians before their travel to Egypt and very likely Herodotus assumed that because the Egyptian γεωμετρία was older, the Greeks must have got it from there.{{sfn|Lloyd|1975|pp=52–53}}

In terms of our modern understanding of the Greeks, and in particular the early use of their nascent [[Greek alphabet]], the finds of Naucratis have turned out to be foundational. &quot;The inscriptions on the pottery have yielded what Mr. Ernest Gardner considers - apparently on firm grounds - to be the oldest Ionic inscriptions, as well as some in the Korinthian, Melian, and Lesbian alphabets.&quot;{{sfn|Petrie|1890|p=271}} Of particular interest are the several examples of an evolutionary variation from the original [[Phoenician alphabet]]ic script. Much has also been learned by comparing these alphabets with the forms they assumed a century later, forms that were destined to become universal across the Hellenic world.{{sfn|Gardner|1886|pp=222–223}}

Naucratis was not only the first Greek settlement in Egypt but also Egypt's most important harbor in antiquity until the rise of Alexandria and the shifting of the Nile led to its decline.

Nevertheless, the ancient city of [[Heracleion]]/Thonis also rivalled Naucratis as an important port city of Egypt, especially from the 6th to the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUNKEN CIVILIZATIONS - HERACLEION&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html | work = Sunken civilisation | title = Heracleion | accessdate=2013-06-06 |  last =Goddio | first = Franck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herodotus==
[[File:Terracotta head Naucratis.png|thumb|Terracotta head]]
*Herodotus tells us that the prostitutes of Naucratis were &quot;peculiarly alluring&quot; and relates the story of Charaxus, brother of the poet [[Sappho]], who traveled to Naucratis to purchase (for a &quot;vast sum&quot;) the freedom of one [[Rhodopis (hetaera)|Rhodopis]], a bewitchingly beautiful Thracian slave and courtesan. After obtaining her freedom, she set up a house of ill-repute, built up a thriving business and amassed a small fortune. As a measure of thanks she commissioned an expensive votive offering to the gods, eventually placed at [[Delphi]] and which could be seen still in the historian's day.{{sfn|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.135 2.135]}}
*An Athenian cup found in one of the sanctuaries has a dedication inscribed from a worshipper named &quot;[[Herodotus]]&quot; and dates from the time the great historian was known to have visited there {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Abu Mena''' (also spelled ''Abu [[Menes|Mina]]''&lt;span style=&quot;margin:2.5px;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; {{lang-arz|ابو مينا}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|æbuˈmiːnæ, æbo-|pron}}) was a town, [[monastery]] complex and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[pilgrimage]] centre in [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] [[Egypt]], about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Alexandria]]. Its remains were designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1979. There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the great [[basilica]], are easily discernible.

Recent [[agriculture|agricultural]] efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the [[water table]], which has caused a number of the site's buildings to collapse or become unstable. The site was added to the [[list of World Heritage in Danger]] in 2001. Authorities were forced to place sand in the bases of buildings that are most endangered in the site.

==History==
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|[[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|Christ and Saint Menas]], 6th-century Coptic icon, Louvre]] 
[[File:Abu Mena Modern Monastery 01.JPG|thumb|The modern [[Christian]] monastery of Abu Mena, which is located just north of the ancient site]]
[[Saint Menas|Menas of Alexandria]] was [[martyr]]ed in the late 3rd or early 4th century (see [[Early Christianity]]). Various 5th-century and later accounts give slightly differing versions of his burial and the subsequent founding of his church. The essential elements are that his body was taken from Alexandria on a [[camel]], which was led into the desert beyond [[Lake Mareotis]]. At some point, the camel refused to continue walking, despite all efforts to goad it. This was taken as a sign of divine will, and the body's attendants buried it on that spot.

Most versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. From the Ethiopian [[Synaxarium]] ([[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A.W. Budge]], trans.):
&lt;blockquote&gt;And God wished to reveal the [place of the] body of Saint Mînâs. And there was in that desert a certain shepherd, and one day a sheep which was suffering from the disease of the scab went to that place, and dipped himself in the water of the little spring which was near the place, and he rolled about in it and was healed straightway. And when the shepherd saw this thing, and understood the miracle, he marvelled exceedingly and was astonished. And afterwards he used to take some of the dust from that shrine, and mix it with water, and rub it on the sheep, and if they were ill with the scab, they were straightway healed thereby. And this he used to do at all times, and he healed all the sick who came to him by this means.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Word of the shepherd's healing powers spread rapidly. The synaxarium describes [[Constantine I]] sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|Mena]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. (Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], but [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century).&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Peter (1998). &quot;The Pilgrimage Center of Abû Mînâ&quot;. in D. Frankfurter (ed.), ''Pilgrimage &amp; Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''. Leiden-Boston-Köln, Brill: p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 4th century, it was a significant pilgrimage site for Christians who sought healing and other miracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Talbot | first = Alice-Mary | year = 2002  | title = Pilgrimage to Healing Shrines: The Evidence of Miracle Accounts | journal = Dumbarton Oaks Papers | volume = 56 |pages=153–173  | doi = 10.2307/1291860 | publisher = Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University | jstor = 1291860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Armstrong | first = Gregory T. | year = 1967  | title = Constantine's Churches | journal = Gesta | volume = 6 |pages=1–9  | doi = 10.2307/766661 | publisher = International Center of Medieval Art | jstor = 766661 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menas flask]]s are a particular type of small [[terracotta]] [[ampulla]]e sold to pilgrims as containers for [[holy water]] or holy oil which are found very widely around the Western Mediterranean, dating roughly from the century and a half before the Muslim conquest.  They are cheaply made but impressed with images of the saint that are of significance in the study of [[iconography]]; it is presumed they were made around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, William. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3643040 ''An Archaeology of Late Antique Pilgrim Flasks''], Anatolian Studies, Vol. 54, (2004), pp. 79-93, British Institute at Ankara.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Arcadius]], the local archbishop observed that crowds were overwhelming the small [[Church (building)|church]]. He wrote to the eastern emperor, who ordered a major expansion of the facilities, the first of three major church expansions which would eventually take place. By the end of the Late Antique period, Abu Mena had become the leading pilgrimage site in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnall 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bagnall | first = Roger S. | year = 2001  | title = Archaeological Work on Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, 1995-2000 | journal = American Journal of Archaeology | volume = 105 | issue = 2 |pages=227–243  | doi = 10.2307/507272 | publisher = Archaeological Institute of America | jstor = 507272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weitzmann | first = Kurt | year = 1977  | title = The Late Roman World | journal = The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2 |pages=2–96  | doi = 10.2307/3259887 | publisher = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | jstor = 3259887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological excavations==
The site was first excavated from 1905 to 1907. These efforts uncovered a large basilica church, an adjacent church which had probably housed the [[relic|saint's remains]], and [[Roman bath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilber | first = Donald N. | year = 1940  | title = The Coptic Frescoes of Saint Menas at Medinet Habu | journal = The Art Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 2 |pages=86–103  | doi = 10.2307/3046689 | publisher = College Art Association | jstor = 3046689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later, long-term series of excavations by the [[German Archaeological Institute|DAI]] ended in 1998. The most recent excavations uncovered a large [[dormitory]] for poor pilgrims, with separate wings for men and for women and children. A complex to the south of the great basilica was likely the residence of the ''hegoumenos'', or [[abbot]]. Excavations suggest that the great [[xenodocheion]], a reception area for pilgrims, may originally have been a [[cemetery]]. A [[baptistery]], adjacent to the site of the original church, appears to have gone through at least three phases of development. Also uncovered was a complex of [[wine press]]es, including underground storage rooms, which dates to the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnall 2001&quot; /&gt;

== Threats ==
The site of Abu Mena was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage in Danger]] list in 2001 due to the threat of rising local water tables.  The clay soil that surrounds the site becomes unstable when wet and has led to the collapse of cisterns and other structures about the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/90/threats|title=Abu Mena|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors suggest occupation dates that should begin thousands of years earlier. The oldest known tomb with painted decoration on its [[plaster]] walls is located in Nekhen and is thought to date to ca. 3500-3200 BC. It shares distinctive imagery with artifacts from the [[Gerzeh culture]]. 

==Horus cult center==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Main deposit (Nekhen)]] --&gt;
Nekhen was the center of the [[cult]] of a hawk deity, [[Horus#Forms of the god Horus|Horus of Nekhen]], which raised one of the most ancient [[Egyptian temple]]s in this city. It retained its importance as the cultic center for this divine patron of the kings long after the site had otherwise declined.

The first settlement at Nekhen dates from either the predynastic [[Amratian culture]] (circa 4400 BC) or, perhaps, during the late [[Badari culture]] (circa 5000 BC). At its height from about 3400 BC, Nekhen had at least 5,000 and possibly, as many as 10,000 inhabitants.

The ruins of the city originally were excavated toward the end of the nineteenth century by the [[England|English]] archaeologists [[James Quibell]] and [[Frederick W. Green (Egyptologist)|Frederick W. Green]].

Quibell and Green discovered the &quot;Main Deposit&quot;, a [[foundation deposit]] beneath the temple,&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw197&quot;&gt;Shaw, Ian. ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt''. p197. Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw32&quot;&gt;Shaw, Ian. ''Exploring Ancient Egypt.'' p.32 Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Quibell originally was trained under [[Flinders Petrie]], the father of modern [[Egyptology]], however, he failed to follow Petrie's methods. The temple was a difficult site to excavate to begin with, so his excavation was poorly conducted and then poorly documented.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw32&quot;/&gt; Specifically, the situational context of the items therein is poorly recorded and often, the reports of Quibell and Green are in contradiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw32&quot;/&gt;

The most famous artifact commonly associated with the main deposit, the [[Narmer Palette]], now is thought probably not to have been in the main deposit at all. Quibell's report made in 1900 put the palette in the deposit, but Green's report in 1902 put it about one to two yards away.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw33&quot;&gt;Shaw, Ian. ''Exploring Ancient Egypt.'' p.33 Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Green's version is substantiated by earlier field notes (Quibell kept none), so it is now the accepted record of events.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw33&quot;/&gt;

The main deposit dates to the early [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw32&quot;/&gt; but the artistic style of the objects in the deposit indicate that they were from [[Naqada III]] and were moved into the deposit at a later date. The other important item in the deposit clearly dates to the late prehistoric.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ian. ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt.'' p254. Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This object, the [[Scorpion Macehead]], depicts a king known only by the ideogram for scorpion, now called [[Scorpion II]], participating in what seems to be a ritual irrigation ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardiner403&quot;&gt;Gardiner, Alan. ''Egypt of the Pharaohs.'' p. 403. Oxford University Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Narmer Palette is more famous because it shows the first king to wear both the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Scorpion Macehead also indicates some early military hostility with the north by showing dead [[lapwing]]s, the symbol of Lower Egypt, hung from standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardiner403&quot;/&gt;

More recently, the concession was excavated further by a multinational team of archaeologists, Egyptologists, geologists, and members of other sciences, which was coordinated by [[Michael A. Hoffman|Michael Hoffman]] until his death in 1990, then by [[Barbara Adams (Egyptologist)|Barbara Adams]] of [[University College London]] and Dr. Renee Friedman representing the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[British Museum]] until Barbara Adams's death in 2001,&lt;ref name=gruniad&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries?INTCMP=SRCH Obituary], Harry Smith, ''The Guardian'', 13 July 2002, Retrieved 11 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Renée Friedman]] thereafter.

==Possible ritual structures==
The structure at Nekhen known by the [[misnomer]] &quot;fort&quot; is a massive mud-brick enclosure built by Pharaoh [[Khasekhemwy]] of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive Dig Hierakonpolis - Fixing the Fort|url=http://www.archaeology.org/interactive/hierakonpolis/fort.html|website=www.archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to be similar in structure and ritual purpose as the similarly misidentified 'forts' constructed at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], all without apparent military function. The true function of these structures is unknown, but they seem to be related to the rituals of kingship and the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Renee Friedman, &quot;The 'Fort' at Hierakonopolis&quot;, ''Ancient Egypt'' June/July 2006, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Religion was interwoven inexorably with kingship in Ancient Egypt. 

The ritual structure was built on a prehistoric cemetery. The excavations there, as well as the work of later brick robbers, have seriously undermined the walls and led to the near collapse of the structure. For two years, during 2005 and 2006, the team led by Friedman was attempting to stabilize the existing structure and support the endangered areas of the structure with new [[mudbrick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Renee Friedman, &quot;The 'Fort' at Hierakonopolis&quot;, ''Ancient Egypt'' June/July 2006, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oldest known Egyptian painted tomb==
[[File:Túmulo 100.JPG|thumb|right|x100px|An ancient Nekhen tomb painting in plaster with barques, staffs, goddesses, and animals - possibly the earliest example]]
Other discoveries at Nekhen include Tomb 100, the oldest tomb with painted decoration on its [[plaster]] walls. The sepulchre is thought to date to the [[Gerzeh culture]] (ca. 3500-3200 BC).

The decoration shows presumed religious scenes and images that include figures featured in Egyptian culture for three thousand years&amp;mdash;a funerary procession of [[barque]]s, presumably a goddess standing between two upright [[lion]]esses, a wheel of various horned quadrupeds, several examples of a staff that became associated with the deity of the earliest [[cattle in religion and mythology|cattle culture]] and one being held up by a heavy-breasted goddess. Animals depicted include [[onager]]s or [[zebra]]s, [[capra (genus)|ibexes]], [[ostrich]]es, lionesses, [[impala]]s, [[gazelle]]s, and cattle.

==Oldest known zoo==
The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Nekhen in 2009 of a menagerie that dates to ca. 3500 BC. The exotic animals included [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]], [[hartebeest]], [[elephant]]s, [[baboon]]s, and [[wildcat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, ''Archaeology Magazine'', http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous activity ==
There are later tombs at Nekhen, dating to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. In the painted tomb of [[Horemkhauef]] a biographical inscription reporting Horemkhauef's journey to the capital was found. He lived during the Second Intermediate Period. Because it had a strong association with Egyptian religious ideas about kingship, the temple of Horus at Nekhen was used as late as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Michael Allen|last2=Hamroush|first2=Hany A.|last3=Allen|first3=Ralph O.|title=A Model of Urban Development for the Hierakonpolis Region from Predynastic through Old Kingdom Times|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|date=1 January 1986|volume=23|page=186|doi=10.2307/40001098|jstor=40001098}}&lt;/ref&gt; persisting as a religious center throughout the thousands of years of Ancient Egyptian culture.

'''Philae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ai|l|i}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Φιλαί}}, {{lang-ar|فيله}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-arz|fiːlæ|lang}}, [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''p3-jw-rķ' or 'pA-jw-rq''; [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Script/Coptic|ⲡⲓⲗⲁⲕ, ⲡⲓⲗⲁⲕⲭ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holger|first=Kockelmann,|date=2012-04-24|title=Philae|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1456t8bn#page-2|journal=UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is currently an [[island]] in the reservoir of the [[Aswan Low Dam]], downstream of the [[Aswan Dam]] and [[Lake Nasser]], [[Egypt]]. Philae was originally located near the expansive [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the [[Nile]] in [[Upper Egypt]] and was the site of an [[Egyptian temple]] complex.

==Geography==
[[File:Philae temple.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Panoramic view at the Philae Temple, at its current location on [[Agilkia Island]]]]

Philae is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;i. p. 40, xvii. pp. 803, 818, 820&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;i. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;iv. 5. § 74&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],&lt;ref&gt;''Quaest. Nat.'' iv. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;v. 9. s. 10&lt;/ref&gt; It was, as the plural name indicates, the appellation of two small islands situated in latitude [[24th parallel north|24° north]], just above the First Cataract near [[Aswan]] (Egyptian ''Swenet'' &quot;Trade;&quot; {{lang-grc|Συήνη}}). Groskurd&lt;ref&gt;''Strab.'' vol. iii. p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; computes the distance between these islands and Aswan at about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}.

Despite being the smaller island, Philae proper was, from the numerous and picturesque ruins formerly there, the more interesting of the two. Prior to the inundation, it was not more than {{convert|380|m}} long and about {{convert|120|m}} broad. It is composed of [[syenite]]: its sides are steep and on their summits a lofty wall was built encompassing the island.

Since Philae was said to be one of the burying-places of [[Osiris]], it was held in high reverence both by the Egyptians to the north and the [[Nubians]] (often referred to as &quot;Ethiopians&quot; in Greek) to the south. It was deemed profane for any but priests to dwell there and was accordingly sequestered and denominated &quot;the Unapproachable&quot; ({{lang-grc|ἄβατος}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plutarch|author-link=Plutarch|title=[[Moralia]]|editor-first=Gregorius N.|editor-last=Bernardakis|place=Leipzig|publisher=Teubner|year=1889|volume=2|chapter=De Iside et Osiride 359b|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0238%3Astephpage%3D359b}} {{cite book|author=Diodorus|author-link=Diodorus Siculus|title=[[Bibliotheca Historica]]|volume=1-2|editor1-first=Immanuel|editor1-last=Bekker|editor1-link=August Immanuel Bekker|editor2-first=Ludwig|editor2-last=Dindorf|editor2-link=Karl Wilhelm Dindorf#Ludwig Dindorf|editor3-first=Friedrich|editor3-last=Vogel|publisher=In aedibus [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|B.

Quaest. Nat. iv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; These indeed were the traditions of a remote period; since in the time of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], Philae was so much resorted to, partly by pilgrims to the tomb of Osiris, partly by persons on secular errands, that the priests petitioned [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] (170-117 BC) to prohibit public functionaries at least from coming there and living at their expense.

In the nineteenth century, [[William John Bankes]] took the [[Philae obelisk]] on which this petition was engraved to [[England]]. When its [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] were compared with those of the [[Rosetta Stone]], it threw great light upon the Egyptian consonantal alphabet.

The islands of Philae were not, however, merely sacerdotal abodes; they were the centres of commerce also between [[Meroë]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. For the rapids of the cataracts were at most seasons impracticable, and the commodities exchanged between Egypt and Nubia were reciprocally landed and re-embarked at Syene and Philae.

The neighbouring [[granite]] [[quarry|quarries]] also attracted a numerous population of miners and stonemasons; and, for the convenience of this traffic, a gallery or road was formed in the rocks along the east bank of the Nile, portions of which are still extant.

Philae also was remarkable for the singular effects of light and shade resulting from its position near the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. As the sun approached its northern limit the shadows from the projecting cornices and moldings of the temples sink lower and lower down the plain surfaces of the walls, until, the sun having reached its highest altitude, the vertical walls are overspread with dark shadows, forming a striking contrast with the fierce light which illuminates all surrounding objects.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, ''Erdkunde'', vol. i. p. 680, seq.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Construction===
The most conspicuous feature of both islands was their architectural wealth. Monuments of various eras, extending from the Pharaohs to the Caesars, occupy nearly their whole area. The principal structures, however, lay at the south end of the smaller island.

The most ancient was a temple for [[Isis]], built in the reign of [[Nectanebo I]] during 380-362 BC, which was approached from the river through a double [[colonnade]]. Nekhtnebef was his [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary]] and he became the founding pharaoh of the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]] and last native dynasty when he deposed and killed [[Nepherites II]].

For the most part, the other ruins date from the Ptolemaic Kingdom, more especially with the reigns of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]], and [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (282-145 BC), with many traces of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman]] work in Philae dedicated to [[Amun|Ammon]]-[[Osiris]].

In front of the propyla were two colossal [[lion]]s in granite, behind which stood a pair of [[obelisk]]s, each {{convert|13|m}} high. The propyla were pyramidal in form and colossal in dimensions. One stood between the [[wikt:dromos|dromos]] and [[Portico#Pronaos|pronaos]], another between the pronaos and the [[portico]], while a smaller one led into the sekos or [[adyton]]. At each corner of the adytum stood a monolithic shrine, the cage of a sacred hawk. Of these shrines one is now in the [[Louvre]], the other in the Museum at [[Florence]].

Beyond the entrance into the principal court are small temples, one of which, dedicated to Isis, Hathor, and a wide range of deities related to [[midwifery]], is covered with sculptures representing the birth of Ptolemy Philometor, under the figure of the god [[Horus]]. The story of [[Osiris]] is everywhere represented on the walls of this temple, and two of its inner chambers are particularly rich in symbolic imagery. Upon the two great propyla are Greek inscriptions intersected and partially destroyed by Egyptian figures cut across them.

The monuments in both islands indeed attested, beyond any others in the Nile valley, the survival of pure Egyptian art centuries after the last of the Pharaohs had ceased to reign. Great pains have been taken to mutilate the sculptures of this temple. The work of demolition is attributable, in the first instance, to the zeal of the [[early Christianity|early Christians]], and afterward, to the policy of the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], who curried favour for themselves with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine court]] by the destruction of {{linktext|heathen}} images as well as Christian ones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It's notable that images/icons of Horus are often less mutilated than the other carvings. In some wall scenes, every figure and hieroglyphic text ''except'' that of Horus and his winged solar-disk representation have been meticulously scratched out by early Christians. This is presumably because the early Christians had some degree of respect for Horus or the legend of Horus - it may be because they saw parallels between the stories of Jesus and Horus (see [[Jesus in comparative mythology#Ancient Egypt]]).

The soil of Philae had been prepared carefully for the reception of its buildings&amp;ndash;being leveled where it was uneven, and supported by masonry where it was crumbling or insecure. For example, the western wall of the Great Temple, and the corresponding wall of the dromos, were supported by very strong foundations, built below the pre-inundation level of the water, and rested on the granite which in this region forms the bed of the Nile. Here and there steps were hewn out from the wall to facilitate the communication between the temple and the river.

At the southern extremity of the dromos of the Great Temple was a smaller temple, apparently dedicated to [[Hathor]]; at least the few columns that remained of it are surmounted with the head of that goddess. Its portico consisted of twelve columns, four in front and three deep. Their [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s represented various forms and combinations of the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]], the [[Hyphaene thebaica|doum palm]] branch, and the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus flower]]. These, as well as the sculptures on the columns, the ceilings, and the walls were painted with the most vivid colors, which, owing to the dryness of the climate, have lost little of their original brilliance.

==History==

===Pharaonic era===
[[File:S10.08 Philae, image 9610.jpg|thumbnail|right|A sphinx in Philae]]
The ancient Egyptian name of the smaller island meant &quot;boundary&quot;. As their southern frontier, the [[pharaoh]]s of Egypt kept there a strong garrison, and it was also a barracks for Greek and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers in their turn. The first temple structure, which was built by native pharaohs of the 30th dynasty, was the one for [[Hathor]].

===Greco-Roman era===
The island temple was built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. The principal deity of the temple complex was [[Isis]], but other temples and shrines were dedicated to other deities such as [[Hathor]]. [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] believe that Philae was the last active site of the native [[ancient Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher_2015_History_Weekend&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media

The temple was closed down officially in the sixth century by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] (527-565). Philae was subsequently a seat of Christianity. Ruins of a church have been discovered and more than one adyton bore traces of having been made to serve at different eras the purposes of a chapel of [[Osiris]] and of [[Jesus]].

===1800s===
The island of Philae attracted much attention in the 19th century.  In the 1820s, [[Joseph Bonomi the Younger]], a British [[Egyptologist]] and [[museum]] [[curator]] visited the island.  So did [[Amelia Edwards]], a British [[novelist]] in 1873&amp;ndash;1874.
{{quote|The approach by water is quite the most beautiful. Seen from the level of a small boat, the island, with its palms, its colonnades, its pylons, seems to rise out of the river like a mirage. Piled rocks frame it on either side, and the purple mountains close up the distance. As the boat glides nearer between glistening boulders, those sculptured towers rise higher and even higher against the sky. They show no sign of ruin or age. All looks solid, stately, perfect. One forgets for the moment that anything is changed. If a sound of antique chanting were to be borne along the quiet air&amp;ndash;if a procession of white-robed priests bearing aloft the veiled ark of the God, were to come sweeping round between the palms and pylons&amp;ndash;we should not think it strange.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}|sign=Amelia B. Edwards|source=A thousand miles up the Nile / by Amelia B. Edwards, 1831-1892, p. 207.}}

These visits are only a small sample of the great interest that [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Britain had for Egypt.  Soon, [[tourism]] to Philae became common.

===1900s===

====Aswan Low Dam====
[[File:Philae (1906) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Philae flooded by the [[Aswan Low Dam]] in 1906.]]
[[File:Kioske of Phylae on the Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Kioske of Phylae on the Flood]]
In 1902, the [[Aswan Low Dam]] was completed on the Nile River by the [[United Kingdom|British]].  This threatened many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae, with being submerged.  The height of the dam was raised twice, from 1907–1912 and from 1929–1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always flooded.  In fact, the only times that the complex was not underwater was when the [[dam]]'s [[sluice]]s were open from July to October.

It was proposed that the temples be relocated, piece by piece, to nearby islands, such as [[Bigeh]] or [[Elephantine]].  However, the temples' [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s and other [[architecture|architectural]] supporting structures were strengthened instead.  Although the buildings were physically secure, the island's attractive [[vegetation]] and the colors of the temples' [[relief]]s were washed away.  Also, the bricks of the Philae temples soon became encrusted with [[silt]] and other debris carried by the Nile.

====Rescue project====
The temples had been practically intact since the ancient days, but with each inundation the situation worsened and in the 1960s the island was submerged up to a third of the buildings all year round.

In 1960 [[UNESCO]] started a project to try to save the buildings on the island from the destructive effect of the ever-increasing waters of the [[Nile]]. First, building three dams and creating a separate lake with lower water levels was considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000663/066319eb.pdf |title=Report on the safeguarding of the Philae monuments |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 1960 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First of all, a large [[coffer dam]] was built, constructed of two rows of steel plates between which a {{convert|1|e6m3|lk=on|abbr=off}} of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away.

| image2 = [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/51201612 Another view of the remnants]
}}
Next the monuments were cleaned and measured, by using [[photogrammetry]], a method that enables the exact reconstruction of the original size of the building blocks that were used by the ancients. Then every building was dismantled into about 40,000 units, and then transported to the nearby [[Agilkia Island|Island of Agilkia]], situated on higher ground some {{convert|500|m|ft}} away.{{clear left}}

==Nearby locations of interest==
Prior to the inundation, a little west of Philae lay a larger island, anciently called Snem or Senmut, but now [[Bigeh]]. It is very steep, and from its most elevated peak affords a fine view of the Nile, from its smooth surface south of the islands to its plunge over the shelves of rock that form the First Cataract. Philae, Bigeh and another lesser island divided the river into four principal streams, and north of them it took a rapid turn to the west and then to the north, where the cataract begins.

Bigeh, like Philae, was a holy island; its ruins and rocks are inscribed with the names and titles of [[Amenhotep&amp;nbsp;III]], [[Ramesses II]], [[Psamtik&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Apries]], and [[Amasis&amp;nbsp;II]], together with memorials of the later [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rulers of Egypt. Its principal ruins consisted of the [[propylon]] and two columns of a temple, which was apparently of small dimensions, but of elegant proportions. Near them were the fragments of two colossal [[granite]] statues and also an excellent piece of masonry of much later date, having the aspect of an arch belonging to a church or [[mosque]].

&lt;!---[[File:Fortress of Ibrim--Nubia-David Roberts.jpg|thumb|Fortress of Qasr Ibrim, on a cliff above the [[Nile]].]]---&gt;
'''Qasr Ibrim''' ({{lang-ar|قصر ابريم}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Lower Nubia]], located in the modern country of [[Egypt]]. The name dates far back into antiquity; it was Pedeme to the Meroitic inhabitants, and Primis to the Romans. The site has a long history of occupation, ranging from as early as the eighth century BC to 1813 AD, and was an economic, political, and religious center.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Der Vliet|first1=J.|last2=Hagen|first2=J.L.|title=Qasr Ibrim, Between Egypt and Africa: Studies in Cultural Exchange|date=2013|publisher=Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten|location=Leiden, Nederland|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was a major city perched on a cliff above the [[Nile]], but the flooding of [[Lake Nasser]] after the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] transformed it into an island and flooded its outskirts. Qasr Ibrim is the only major archaeological site in Lower Nubia to have survived the Nile floods. Both prior to and after the Nile floods, it has remained a major site for archaeological investigations.

==History==
Human habitation at the site dates from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], but it reached its greatest prominence in the [[Middle Ages]], when the area was the home of the [[Eparch]] of [[Nobatia]]. Qasr Ibrim is the source of the largest collection of [[Old Nubian]] documents ever found, including the records of the Eparch. The site was occupied until 1813, when the last occupants were driven out by artillery fire.  . Today the island is closed to all but archaeologists.

===Egyptian influence===
Egypt's influence in [[Nubia]] began around 2,000 BC, when Egyptian invaded and claimed sovereignty over the area.&lt;ref name= &quot;BEA&quot;/&gt; Many Egyptian artifacts and evidence of Egyptian architecture have been found at Qasr Ibrim. The earliest inscription at the site is a [[stela]], a stone or wooden slab, from the reign of [[Amenhotep I]]. The stela was found in a now-ruined Christian [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] cathedral at Qasr Ibrim where it had been reused in one of the church's crypts. The stela is now located in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/qasribrim.htm|title=Egypt: Qasr Ibrim in ancient Nubia|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman occupation===
The site was partly rebuilt &quot;under the prefecture of Gaius Petronius during Augustus' reign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Rosalie|title=Discovering Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Facts on File|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qasr Ibrim played a key role in Rome's defense of the Aswan region, and was likely held until 100 AD or later.&lt;ref name= &quot;SD&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander|first1=John|title=The Saharan Divide in the Nile Valley: The Evidence from Qasr Ibrim|journal=The African Archaeological Review|date=1988|volume=6|pages=73–90|doi=10.1007/bf01117113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress, constructed by Roman military engineers, was the strongest in the Nile Valley at this time.&lt;ref name= &quot;SD&quot;/&gt;

=== A center of Christianity===
[[File:Stela of Georgios, bishop of Ibrim, 10th to 11th century AC, currently housed in the Petrie Museum.jpg|thumb|Stela of Georgios, bishop of Ibrim, 10th to 11th century AC, currently housed in the Petrie Museum]]
During Roman times the town was one of the last bastions of paganism, its six temples converting to Christianity two centuries later than the rest of Egypt. It then became one of the main Christian centers in Lower Nubia. Christianity first came to Qasr Ibrim in the 6th century, but had little effect. It wasn't until the city became part of the kingdom of [[Makuria]], in the early 8th century, that Qasr Ibrim became a center for Christianity. This continued even through the fifteenth century when the Makurian kingdom became Islamic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;/&gt; The city held out against Islam until the 16th century, when a unit of [[Bosnian people|Bosnian]] soldiers, part of the Ottoman army, occupied the site. The Bosnian soldiers stayed on and eventually married into the local Nubian community, using part of the cathedral as a mosque.

Two churches remain on the site. The Taharqa Church was most likely built between 542-580 AD, this would make it one of Nubia's earliest churches. Like many of the first churches in Nubia, it would have been constructed within the walls of the already present temples.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;/&gt; Qasr Ibrim's cathedral was built later, though the date of construction in unclear. Archaeologists currently believe it was constructed in the first half of the eighth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;/&gt;

==Archaeology==
The site was first excavated by [[David Randall-MacIver]] and [[C. Leonard Woolley]] for the Eckley B. Coxe Expedition for the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randall-MacIver|first1=David|last2=Woolley|first2=Leonard|title=Buhen|date=1911|publisher=University Museum|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, excavations were started by the [[Egyptian Exploration Society]] and have continued periodically to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMP&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=William|title=Qasr Ibrim. The Earlier Medieval Period|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Qasr-Ibrim-Earlier-Medieval-Excavation/dp/0856981915|date=2010|publisher=Egypt Exploration Society|isbn=978-0856981913|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cemeteries found east and west of the main settlement were excavated in 1932 and 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMP&quot;/&gt; There are still areas around the complex that have yet to be excavated, although some sites, including those near the river, were destroyed in floods caused by the Aswan Dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMP&quot;/&gt;

===Evidence for plant and animal use===
The almost rainless conditions of the area have created excellent preservation of organic materials. Pot sherds dated to the post-Meroitic period (AD 350-600) show evidence of both date palm and doum palm residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Copley|first1=Mark S.|last2=Rose|first2=Pamela J.|last3=Clapham|first3=Alan|last4=Edwards|first4=David N.|last5=Horton|first5=Mark C.|last6=Evershed|first6=Richard P.|title=Detection of palm fruit lipids in archaeological pottery from Qasr Ibrim, Egyptian Nubia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2001|volume=268|issue=1467|pages=593–597|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1394|pmid=11297176|pmc=1088645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various samples of [[sorghum]] dating from between 800 BC to AD 1800 have also been found at Qasr Ibrim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=William J.|last2=Rowley-Conwy|first2=Petr|last3=Shaw|first3=Charles H.|title=Amplification and Sequencing of DNA from Preserved Sorghum of up to 2800 Years Antiquity Found at Qasr Ibrim|journal=Ancient Biomolecules|date=March 1998|volume=2|issue=1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four forms of sorghum that are found on the site. From when the site was settled until around 100 AD only wild sorghum can be found. From 100 AD until around 1500 AD an early form of cultivated sorghum (''Sorghum bicolor'', ssp. ''bicolor'', race Bicolor) is found. Around 1200 AD an advanced form of sorghum (''Sorghum bicolor'', ssp. ''bicolor'', race Durra) appears. Between the 5 and 7th centuries AD a transitional race is also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=William J.|last2=Rowley-Conwy|first2=Peter|last3=Shaw|first3=Charles H.|title=The sorghum of Qasr Ibrim: Reconstructing DNA templates from ancient seeds|journal=Ancient Biomolecules|date=May 1998|volume=2|issue=2/3|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are believed to be three phases of agricultural history, the Napatan occupation, the Roman occupation, and the Meroitic periods. Listed below are the main crops that have been identified in each phase:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapham|first1=A.J.|last2=Rowley-Conwy|first2=P.A.|title=Fields of change: progress in African archaeobotany.|date=2007|publisher=Barkhuis &amp; Groningen University Library|location=The Netherlands|pages=157–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Napatan (mid 8th-mid 7th century BC):'''
*[[emmer wheat]] (''Triticum turgidum'' L.)
*hulled [[barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'' L.)
*[[broomcorn millet]] (''Panicum miliaceum'' L.)
*[[flax]] (''Linum usitatissimum'' L.)

'''Roman (25 BC-mid 1st century AD):'''
*[[emmer wheat]] (''Triticum turgidum'' L.)
*hulled [[barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'' L.)
*[[broomcorn millet]] (''Panicum miliaceum'' L.)
*[[flax]] (''Linum usitatissimum'' L.)
*[[cotton]] (''Gossypium'' sp.)

'''Meroitic (AD 100-300):'''
*[[sorghum]] (''Sorghum bicolor'')
*hulled [[barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'' L.)
*[[durum wheat]] (''Triticum turgidum'' ssp. ''turgidum'')
*[[bread wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum'')

The site has also revealed many archaeozoological remains, though they have not been as heavily studied as the botanical remains. Evidence of a heavily sheep and goat based economy has been found, along with large numbers of juvenile cattle. These cattle remains suggest a meat- and milk-based economy. The cattle could also have been used for religious ceremonies at the [[Meroë|Meroitic]] Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Copley|first1=Mark S.|title=Short-and long-term foraging and foddering strategies of domesticated animals from Qasr Ibrim, Egypt|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2004|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1273–1286|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2004.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artifacts ===
[[File:Caliga Qasr Ibrim.jpg|thumb|Original Roman caliga, found at Qasr Ibrim, Egypt. 1st century BC – 1st century AD. British Museum, room 65.]]
Qasr Ibrim is known not only for its organic remains, textiles have also been found at the site. During the Roman occupation of the site sandals, textiles, and leather fragments were left behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;/&gt; Woolen fabrics are believed to have brought to Qasr Ibrim in 23 BC by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BEA&quot;/&gt; Cotton fabrics were not introduced until the first century AD by the [[Meroë|Meroitic]] peoples. The un-dyed Meroitic fabrics differ from the wool of the Romans, which has been found in blues and other bright colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEA&quot;/&gt;

The conditions at Qasr Ibrim have also preserved a large number of documents, including Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Nubian. Earlier documents were written on papyrus, though parchment was the preferred material for sacred texts. Paper was not common writing material in Nubia until the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMP&quot;/&gt; The nature of the documents range from a variety of religious and secular texts,including personal letters, and religious documents. These documents show the significance of Qasr Ibrim as a frontier society, and the importance of a vast trade network.

'''Akhmim''' ({{lang-ar|أخميم}}, {{IPA-ar|ʔæxˈmiːm|pron}}; from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Khent-min&amp;#x202f;''; Sahidic {{lang-cop|Ϣⲙⲓⲛ}} ''{{transl|cop|Shmin}}'') is a city in the [[Sohag Governorate]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. Referred to by the ancient Greeks as '''Khemmis''', '''Chemmis''' and '''Panopolis''', it is located on the east bank of the [[Nile]], 4 miles to the northeast of [[Sohag]].
 
== History ==
[[File:Akhmim3.jpg|thumb|left|Temple of Min]]
Akhmim was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] as '''Ipu''', '''Apu''' or '''Khent-min'''. It was the capital of the ninth (Chemmite) [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. The city is a suggested hometown for [[Yuya]], the official of [[Tuthmosis IV]] and [[Amenhotep III]]. The ithyphallic [[Min (god)|Min]] (whom the Greeks identified with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) was worshipped here as &quot;the strong [[Horus]].&quot; [[Herodotus]] mentions the temple dedicated to [[Perseus]] and asserts that Chemmis was remarkable for the celebration of games in honor of that [[hero]], after the manner of the Greeks, at which prizes were given; as a matter of fact some representations are known of [[Nubia]]ns and people of [[Land of Punt|Punt]] (southern coastal [[Sudan]] and the [[Eritrea]]n coast) clambering up poles before the god Min. Min was especially a god of the desert routes on the east of [[Egypt]], and the trading tribes are likely to have gathered to his festivals for business and pleasure at [[Coptos]] (which was really near [[Caene|Neapolis]]) even more than at Akhmim. Herodotus perhaps confused [[Coptos]] with Chemmis. [[Strabo]] mentions linen-weaving and stone-cutting as ancient industries of Panopolis, and it is not altogether a coincidence that the cemetery of Akhmim is one of the chief sources of the beautiful textiles of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Christian]] age, that are brought from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Akhmim|volume=1|page=456|first=Francis Llewellyn |last=Griffith |authorlink=Francis Llewellyn Griffith}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AkhmimSeifeinOldInside.jpg|thumb|Church of Abu Seifein]]
In the [[Christian]] [[Copt]]ic era, Akhmim was written in Sahidic {{lang-cop|Ϣⲙⲓⲛ/Ⲭⲙⲓⲛ/Ⲭⲙⲓⲙ}} ''{{transl|cop|Shmin/Kmin/Kmim}}'' but was probably pronounced locally something like '''Khmin''' or '''Khmim'''. [[Monastery|Monasteries]] abounded in this region from a very early date. [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]] (348–466) was a [[monk]] at [[Athribis (Upper Egypt)|Athribis]] near Akhmim. Some years earlier [[Nestorius]], the exiled ex-patriarch of [[Constantinople]], had died at an old age in the neighborhood of Akhmim. [[Nonnus]], the Greek [[poet]], was born at Panopolis at the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; The bishopric of Panopolis, a [[suffragan]] of [[Antinoë]] in [[Thebaid|Thebais Prima]], is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Ánnuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 949&lt;/ref&gt; Among the bishops of Panopolis, [[Le Quien]] mentions &lt;ref&gt;''Oriens christianus'', II, 601–4&lt;/ref&gt; Arius, friend of [[Saint Pachomius]] who had built three convents in the city, Sabinus, and Menas. Excavations at Akhmim have disclosed numerous [[Christian]] manuscripts, among them fragments of the ''[[Book of Henoch]]'', of the Gospel, and of the ''[[Apocalypse of Peter]]'', the ''[[Council of Ephesus|Acts of the Council of Ephesus]]'', as well as numerous other [[Christian]] inscriptions.

In the 13th century AD, a very imposing temple still stood in Akhmim.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Today, little of its past glory remains. Nothing is left of the town, the temples were almost completely dismantled, and their material reused in the later [[Middle Ages]]. The extensive cemeteries of ancient Akhmim are yet to be fully explored. The destroyed corner of a Greco-Roman period temple with colossal statues of [[Ramesses II]] and [[Meritamen]] were discovered in 1981.

== Modern city ==

Akhmim is the largest town on the east side of the [[Nile]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. In 1907, the population of the city was 23,795, of whom about one third were [[Copt]]s. Akhmim has several [[mosque]]s and two [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches. The [[Monastery of the Martyrs]] is located about 6&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city. Akhmim maintains a weekly market, and manufactures [[cotton]] goods, notably the blue shirts and check shawls with [[silk]] fringes worn by the poorer classes of [[Egypt]]. Outside the walls are the scanty ruins of two ancient temples. On the west bank of the [[Nile]] opposite of Akhmim, there is railway communication with [[Cairo]] and [[Aswan]].

'''Cusae''' ({{lang-gr|Kusai}}; {{lang-cop|ⲕⲱⲥⲉⲓ or ⲕⲟⲥⲉⲓ}}) was a city in [[Upper Egypt]], known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as '''Qis''' or '''Kis'''. Today, the town is known as '''[[El Quseyya]]''', and is located on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in the [[Asyut Governorate]].

At the beginning of the reign of the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] [[pharaoh]] [[Kamose]], Cusae marked the boundary between the northern [[Hyksos]] realm (the [[Fifteenth dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]]) and the southern Theban kingdom (the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimal |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Grimal |date=1992 |title= A History of Ancient Egypt |url= |location= Oxford |publisher= Blackwell Books |page=191 |isbn=  |access-date= November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a cult centre for [[Hathor]], and also contained a [[necropolis]], [[Meir, Egypt|Meir]], which was used during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] to hold the tombs of local aristocrats.

During the 5th century, the city was the settlement of [[Legio II Flavia Constantia|Legio II ''Flavia Constantia'']].

== Bishopric ==

The [[bishopric]] of Cusae was a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Antinoë]], capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Thebaid|Thebaid I]]. Achilles (or Achilleus) was ordained bishop of the see by [[Meletius of Lycopolis]]. Another, Elias, was of the 4th or 5th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;S. Timm, ''Das christlich-koptische Ägypten'', Wiesbaden 1982-1992, 2181 e 2189 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Theonas took part in the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553). Later bishops took the non-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] side, the first of them being Gregorius, who assisted [[Pope John II (III) of Alexandria]] on his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 595-598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Janin, v. ''Cusae'' in [http://booksnow.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca2/4/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft/dictionnairedhis13bauduoft.pdf ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. XIII, Paris 1956, col. 1117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaas A. Worp, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/8214/5_039_223.pdf?sequence=1 ''A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750)''], in ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 100 (1994) 283-318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04575b.htm Sophrone Pétridès, &quot;Cusae&quot; in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (New York 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Cusae is today listed by the [[Coptic Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 878&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthylla''' is an ancient city of [[Lower Egypt]], on the [[Canopus]] branch of the [[Nile river]]. [[Herodotus]] and [[Athenaeus]] report that it provided furnishings for the queen of Egypt. It is sometimes thought to be the ancient city of [[Gynaecopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=anthylla-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hu''' ({{Lang-ar|هُ}}) is the modern name of an [[Egypt]]ian town on the Nile, which in more ancient times was the capital of the 7th [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. The nome was referred to as ''Sesheshet'' (Sistrum). The main city was referred to as Hu(t)-sekhem, which was abbreviated as Hu. This led to the Arabic name '''Hiw'''. In Ptolemaic times the city was called '''Diospolis Parva''' (Little Zeus-City) in comparison with [[Thebes, Egypt]], known as Diospolis Magna (Great Zeus-City). It was also called '''Diospolis Superior''' (Upper Zeus-City), in comparison with [[:it:Tell el-Balamun|Diospolis Inferior]] (Lower Zeus-City) in the Nile Delta.

Probably from Cemetery W at Diospolis Parva (Hu), Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
Hu was the centre of the cult surrounding [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], a [[goddess]] in [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Morkot, The Egyptians: an introduction, Psychology Press, 2005. Retrieved from [https://books.google.com/books?id=4P32r_Va3Y0C&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=7th%20nome%20bat&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=hu&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess Bat remains the main goddess until at least the time of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]] as she is mentioned on a shrine belonging to [[Senusret I]]. By the time of the [[New Kingdom]] Bat is replaced by [[Hathor]] as the main goddess worshipped at Hu.&lt;ref&gt;The Horizon: Studies in Egyptology in Honour of M.A. Nur El-Din edited by Basem El-Sharkaway, retrieved from [https://books.google.com/books?id=jgj2R23U28kC&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=7th%20nome%20bat&amp;pg=PA409#v=onepage&amp;q=7th%20nome%20bat&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sehel Island''' is located in the [[Nile]], about {{convert|2|mi|km}} southwest of [[Aswan]] in southern [[Egypt]]. It is a large island, and is roughly halfway between the city and the upstream [[Aswan Low Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Sehel Island, spanning 3/4 the width of the Nile, is the primary large island below the Nile's [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] and the Aswan Low Dam (1902). Following downriver, the next major islands after Sehel are: Saluga, Ambunarti, [[Elephantine]], and then [[Kitchener's Island]]. There are a dozen smaller islands scattered around them.

[[Image:Sehel-steleFamine (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Famine Stela]], Sehel Island.]]

==Archaeological artefacts==
The island was known in ancient tiles as ''Setet'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thaliatook.com/OGOD/anuket.html|title=Switching...|website=www.thaliatook.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many archaeological sites, including sacred places, such as the temple of [[Anuket]], the Egyptian [[water goddess]], and goddess of the Nile's cataracts.

Seheil was home to a [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|stone quarry]] for [[granite]] used during various [[Ancient Egypt]]ian eras, and there are many [[inscription]]s in the island's granite boulders. These inscriptions were usually left by travellers marking either the start or end of their journey to [[Nubia]]. There are several famous inscriptions that record ancient historical events. One is the [[Famine Stela]], which is of [[Greco-Roman]] origin, but claims to record events from the time of [[Djoser]] and [[Imhotep]].

==The name==

This name comes from Hebrew פתם ''Pithom'' which was taken from the [[Late Egyptian]] name '''*Pi-ʔAtōm''' (&lt; '''*Par-ʔAtāma''') 'House of [[Atum]]'. Atum, a solar deity, was one of the major gods of ancient Egypt, and a [[Solar deities|sun-god]] of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].

==Biblical Pithom==

Pithom is one of the cities which, according to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|1:11|31}}, was built for the [[Pharaoh]] of the oppression by the forced labor of the [[Israelite]]s. The other city was [[Pi-Ramesses|Ramses]]; and the [[Septuagint]] adds a third, &quot;''[[On (Ancient Egypt)|On]]'', which is [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].&quot; These cities are called by a Hebrew term rendered  in the Authorized Version &quot;treasure cities&quot; and in the Revised Version &quot;store cities.&quot; The Septuagint renders it {{lang|grc|πόλεις ὀχυραί}} &quot;strong [or &quot;fortified&quot;] cities.&quot; The same term is used of certain cities of [[King Solomon]] in [[Books of Kings|I Kings]] 9:19 (comp. also [[Books of Chronicles|II Chronicles]] 16:4).

==Graeco-Roman Heroöpolis==

Heroöpolis was a large city east of the [[Nile Delta]], situated near the mouth of the Royal Canal which connected the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]]. Although not immediately upon the coast, but nearly due north of the [[Bitter Lakes]], Heroöpolis was of sufficient importance, as a trading station, to confer its name upon the arm of the Red Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἡρωοπολίτης κόλπος}}, Ptol. v. 17. § 1, [[Latin]]: ''Heroopoliticus Sinus''&lt;/ref&gt; which runs up the Egyptian mainland as far as [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoë]] (near modern [[Suez]]) -- the modern [[Gulf of Suez]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophrast. ''Hist. Plant.'' iii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the capital of the 8th [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]].

==Location==
Early on, the location of Pithom—just like the locations of other similar sites, such as [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]—had been the subject of much conjecture and debate. [[Édouard Naville]] and [[Flinders Petrie]] were looking for Pithom along the [[Wadi Tumilat]], an arable strip of land serving as the ancient transit route between Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai—the biblical 'Way of [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=EFYp8I3icisC&amp;pg=PA113 ''Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention?'']  Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|0805446796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1883, Naville believed he had identified Pithom as the archaeological site Tell El Maskhuta. The site of Pithom, as identified by Naville, is at the eastern edge of Wadi Tumilat, south-west of [[Ismaïlia]]. Petrie agreed with this identification. John Holladay, a more recent investigator of the site, also supports this opinion.

===Tell El Retaba===
8 miles west from Tell El Maskhuta is the site of Tell El Retabeh. This is approximately the midpoint of Wadi Tumilat.

Here was found a group of granite statues representing [[Ramesses II]], two inscriptions naming ''Pr-Itm'' (Temple of Atum), storehouses and bricks made without straw. So archeologists (wrongly) concluded that this was the site of [[Pi-Ramesses]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} The excavations carried on by Naville for the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] uncovered a city wall, a ruined temple, and the remains of a series of brick buildings with very thick walls and consisting of rectangular chambers of various sizes, opening only at the top and without any entrances to one another.

Some scholars, such as [[Manfred Bietak]] and [[Kenneth Kitchen]], have argued that this was the ancient Pithom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=EFYp8I3icisC&amp;pg=PA113 ''Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention?'']  Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008. p. 113 {{ISBN|0805446796}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion goes back to the 19th century, when [[Allen Gardiner]] first identified Pithom with the site of Tell El Rebata, and this was later accepted by [[William F. Albright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bromiley | first = Geoffrey W. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P | publisher = Wm. B.

Naville identified all these locations as being in the region of [[Sukkot (place)|Tjeku]] (Sukkot), the 8th Lower Egypt [[nome (Egypt)|nome]].

The joint [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Slovakia|Slovak]] mission has carried out a systematic research at Tell El Retaba since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aigyptos.sk/en/tel-el-retabi Aigyptos Foundation] Slovak Egyptological team&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent analyses have demonstrated that the designation for the temple of [[Atum]], ''pr-itm'', can be found in inscriptions at both sites—both at Tell El Retaba and at Tell El Maskhuta. This seems to demonstrate that the name 'Pithom' was used originally for the earlier site, Tell El Retaba, before it was abandoned. And when the newer city of Tel El Maskhuta was built, the same name was applied to it as well – as the temple of Atum was moved to El Maskhuta. Thus, in effect, 'Pithom' was moved to a new location, which phenomenon is attested with some other cities as well, such as [[Migdol]].

===Wadi Tumilat Project===
Modern excavations at Tel El Maskhuta were carried out by the [[University of Toronto]] 'Wadi Tumilat Project' under the direction of John Holladay. They worked over five seasons between 1978 and 1985. These excavations have shown that the history of Tel El Maskhuta is quite complex. There was a Middle Bronze IIB settlement there (18th-17th centuries BC), associated with the [[Hyksos]], followed by a long break until the late 7th century BC, when there was rebuilding.

This construction at the end of the 7th century may have been carried out by Pharaoh [[Necho II]], possibly as part of his uncompleted canal building project from the Nile to the Gulf of Suez.&lt;ref&gt;Seters, John Van, &quot;The Geography of the Exodus&quot;, in Silberman, Neil Ash (editor), ''The Land That I Will Show You: Essays in History and Archaeology of the Ancient Near East in Honor of J.

'''Al-Azhar Park''' is a public park located in [[Cairo, Egypt]].

Among several honors, this park is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the [[Project for Public Spaces]] ([http://www.pps.org/ PPS]).&lt;ref name=&quot;PPS Sixty&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |title=60 of the World's Great Places - Project for Public Spaces |accessdate=2006-12-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206002657/http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home| archivedate= 6 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was created by the [[Aga Khan Historic Cities Support Programme|Historic Cities Support Programme]] &lt;small&gt;([https://web.archive.org/web/20060511164253/http://www.akdn.org/agency/aktc_hcsp.html HCSP])&lt;/small&gt; of the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] &lt;small&gt;([http://www.akdn.org/agency/aktc.html AKTC])&lt;/small&gt;, an entity of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] &lt;small&gt;([http://www.akdn.org/ AKDN])&lt;/small&gt;. The park, developed at a cost in excess of [[USD]] $30 million, was a gift to Cairo from [[Aga Khan IV]]: a descendant of the [[Fatimid]] Imam-Caliphs who founded the city of Cairo in the year 969.

[[File:Azhar Park Cairo View.jpg|thumb|350px|right|View of [[Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] from Studio Masr Restaurant]]
The park project, a great [[urbanism]] initiative, included 
*The development of the park
*Archeology involving a 12th-century [[Ayyubid]] wall
*Historic building rehabilitation (the 14th Century Umm Sultan Shaban Mosque, the 13th century Khayrbek complex, and the Darb Shoughlan School)
*Several quality of life improvement initiatives requiring skills training, area rehabilitation, microfinance, and support in the areas of health and education, among others.

==The gardens of al-Azhar Park==
In 1984, [[Agha Khan IV]] was visiting [[Cairo]] on a conference. From his hotel balcony Al-Darassa hill was visible: mounts of rubbish amassed during 500 years. He decided to intervene and offer the city of his ancestors the much-needed gift of an oasis in this urban desert. The sum of 30 million dollars was allocated to the project and put in the qualified hand of a local architecture and urbanism office: Sites International.
The site posed several technical challenges; half a millennium of debris was at hand. Works of excavation, grading and replacement with appropriate fill began in 1992. 
&quot;Over 765,000 m3 was taken out of the Park and 160,000 m3 was used as fill elsewhere on site. A further 605,000 m3 was subjected to geotechnical treatment (sieving, washing, etc.) and mixed with 60,000 m3 of special sand and topsoil to enable the site to be covered with a layer of “good” soil from 0.5 to 2.0 meters deep. A total of 1.5 million cubic meters of rubble and soil were moved, which represents over 80,000 truckloads.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Al-Azhar Park, Cairo and the Revitalisation of Darb Al-Ahmar, Project Brief, the Agha Khan Trust for Culture, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
While the designers grappled with the technical difficulties at hand posed by the terrain and soil the government introduces an additional unexpected constraint at halfway through the process: three cisterns were to be integrated into the terrain to improve the supply of potable water to the city of Cairo. Works had to be interrupted and the design revised to integrate the new three elements.
The new revised layout of the park was then carefully designed according to the landscape of the hill and the new 3 water tanks. It is mainly divided in five sections according to slope inclination, leaving us with: 2 hills (southern and northern), a rolling topography hill to the east, a flat area north and a western steep slope.

The designers insisted on integrating traditional Islamic landscape traditions in both their design and choice of greenery, thus allowing the past flow of the city to come back to life. Tradition and historical legacy were preserved:
This legacy can be seen in a variety of styles from different periods and different regions. It is reflected in the bustan-like orchard spaces, the shaded sitting areas (takhtaboush) and the Fatimid archways used in the construction of Park buildings, among other elements. Persian and Timurid elements are also reflected in the water channels and fountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The [[Nile]], symbol of Egypt and Cairo, also finds a place in the new project as the river is designed to feed the water ponds in the park. The choice of plantation was also carefully made, according to landscape and quality of soil. Several tests were done at the [[American University in Cairo]] that offered its nursery for propagating the flora of the park to make sure that the adequate choices for the climate were being made. 
Opened to the public in 2005, the gardens of al-Azhar are reminiscent of historical [[Islamic garden]]s, with a blend of modern and traditional elements.  The central terraced formal gardens, emphatic use of fountains, [[Mamluk]] multicolored stonework, sunken gardens, intersecting waterways and bold Islamic geometry are all integrated into a contemporary site design; cafes are situated at the entrance, playgrounds and scenic overlooks are arranged along curving paths.  The site is supported by a reservoir constructed for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ruggles |first=D. Fairchild |authorlink=D. Fairchild Ruggles |title=Islamic Gardens and Landscapes |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2008 |page=168 |isbn=0-8122-4025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of the Ayyubid Wall===
[[File:Ayyubid Wall Al-Azhar Park Cairo 01-2006.jpg|thumb|Ayyubid Wall Al-Azhar Park Cairo 01-2006]]

While the excavation was still ongoing, under the mounts of garbage a treasure was uncovered: a wall to a depth of 15 meters and a 1.5 kilometers section. The forgotten historic Ayyubid Wall and towers were revealed in their entire splendor. It quickly became evident that the new uncovered gem was inseparable from the park project. Buried during centuries, the stone wall presented different forms of deterioration such as flaking and disaggregation. 
&quot;[The] segment of wall constitutes a uniform piece of construction. It comprises a few repeating elements, such as round-fronted towers and curtain walls, and is consistent in its use of materials. […] The walls are adorned and punctuated by crenellations, arrow slits, stairwells and chambers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Study of Deterioration mechanisms and protective treatments for the Egyptian Limestone of the Ayyubid city wall of Cairo, A thesis by Elsa Sophie Odile Bourguignon, presented to the faculties of the university of Pennsylvania, Master of Science, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalization of Darb-Al-Ahmar===
The uncovering of the Ayyubid wall shed the light on the neighboring area of Darb-al-Ahmar. The population of the area, one of the poorest in Cairo, was lacking adequate sanitation and rubbish-collection services due to their adjacent location to the old city dumpster. But that was just the problem at the surface; Darb-al-Ahmar was suffering from deficits and troubles on several levels. Lack of education, sanitation, and hygiene, insalubrious living conditions and extreme poverty were some of the deeper problems. With the new improvement brought to the area by the park, the neighborhood of Darb-al-Ahmar was now in the prominent danger of gentrification causing the dislocation of its inhabitants by new luxury projects. The area also comprised over 60 historical monuments under great distress. 
As the [[AKDC foundation]] lacked funding to encompass this new chapter of the project, the Agha Khan proved once again of agility and commitment to his promise. New foundations providing supplemental funding (such as Egyptian-Swiss Development Fund and [[Ford Foundation]]) were approached to start an invigoration program of the area of Darb-al-Ahmar and continue the flux of the program. 
The rehabilitation program affected the area on two levels: On one hand the physical aspect, accordingly endangered historical monuments were rehabilitated and restored:
&quot;We rebuilt the minaret of the mosque and madrasa of Umm al-Sultan Shaaban based on research and studies on the previous minaret, which collapsed during an earthquake. We rebuilt it in order to show people what it looked like, in order to re-create the past, which might be lost forever otherwise. [...] We not only restore monuments, but we also aim to make them functional and beneficial for the users.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rescuing Cairo's Lost Heritage, By Rose Aslan, Islamica Magazine, 20 October 2006, https://web.archive.org/web/20061026205029/http://www.islamicamagazine.com/issue-15/rescuing-cairos-lost-heritage.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The project started mainly with three buildings: Khayerbek Complex (Mamluk and Ottoman monument), the Darb Shoghlan School restored to be used as the headquarters for the community development company and Umm Al-Sultan Shaaban Complex. Later it extended to encompass more buildings and public spaces.

On another hand, the non-physical aspect, a more sustainable project affecting the residents was also introduced to induce socio-economic growth. Firstly, although the area is populated with one of the poorest inhabitants of Cairo community and family life remained strong. Small family businesses, including carpentry, tile making, and other small crafts, continued to provide a portion of the local population with a living. Those resources were utilized and amplified by the program introduced: training workshops were offered and some long lost crafts were re-introduced (such as [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] wood carving techniques). The project also generated many working opportunities for instance the ayyubid wall restoration project was transformed into a mass employment opportunities as all the working force was hired from darb-al-ahmar and special training workshops were provided. The Carpentry skills were also utilized to produce furniture for the Al-Azhar park. The community as a whole was also involved in the preservation and maintenance of the park. Other apprenticeships were also arranged in the fields of computers, mobile phone services, automobile electronics, office skills and tourist market goods. And finally to complete the socio-economic development long term, micro-credits have been offered to more than 400 individuals to help evolve their businesses. The several programs were also offered to women, in fact in 2008 from the 159 individuals that attended the training session 59% were women.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability in Al Darb Al Ahmar District: An Egyptian Experience, Haysam Nour, PhD Student Polytechnic of Milan&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative of empowering women is a very innovative and positive aspect of this project. In fact, the impact of the Al-Azhar Park project will most certainly fulfill some of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) set forth by the UN at the start of the 21st century.
&quot;the integrated project [realized] three of the MDGs: […] the eradication of extreme poverty through the extension of micro-credit and employment generation; ensuring environmental sustainability through the rehabilitation, and raising the awareness, of cultural and natural assets; and finally, the promotion of global/local partnerships and networks by pooling the resources of contributors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cairo’s Al-Azhar Park: Millennium Development Goals Etched In Green, Khaled El-Khishin, faculty of engineering, BENHA university, Egypt, planning Malaysia, journal of the Malaysian institute of planners (2006) Journal of the Malaysian institute of planners (2006) iv, 23 – 30&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Northern end of the park, an &quot;Urban Plaza&quot; project is under development which will house the [[Museum of Historic Cairo]]. The Urban Plaza will be a mixed-use centre with underground car parking, shops and cultural facilities. It is being built by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture in cooperation with the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=AKDN20071026&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.akdn.org/news/2007october26.htm |title=Two Major Landmarks Restored in Historic Cairo |publisher=Aga Khan Development Network |date=2007-10-26 |accessdate=2007-10-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071103191310/http://www.akdn.org/news/2007october26.htm| archivedate= 3 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum will describe the evolution of [[Egypt|Egypt's]] capital city [[Cairo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anba.com.br/ingles/noticia.php?id=12884 |title=Museum to tell the history of Cairo - Brazil Arab News Agency, November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and house some of the great wealth of art and artifacts of the city's Islamic heritage that are not currently on display. With 4,000 square metres of exhibition space spread over two floors, the museum is expected to have 1,000 pieces on display from different historical periods. It will provide visitors insight into the urban, cultural and architectural history of the heart of Cairo.&lt;ref name=AKDN20071026/&gt;

To conserve and restore all the artefacts and artworks which will be shown in the museum, the Trust has set up a major conservation laboratory, which is training young technicians in this field. It is also being used to restore important art and architectural elements for the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo|Cairo Museum of Islamic Art]].&lt;ref name=AKDN20071026/&gt;

'''Canopus''', also known as '''Canobus'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} ({{Lang-cop|ⲕⲁⲛⲱⲡⲟⲥ}}), was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian coastal town, located in the [[Nile Delta]]. Its site is in the eastern outskirts of modern-day [[Alexandria]], around {{convert|25|km|sp=us|0}} from the center of that city. Canopus was located on the western bank at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the Delta – known as the Canopic or Heracleotic branch. It belonged to the seventh Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]], known as ''Menelaites'', and later as ''Canopites'', after it. It was the principal port in Egypt for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria, along with [[Naucratis]] and [[Heracleion]]. Its ruins lie near the present Egyptian village of [[Abu Qir]].

==Name==
{{Hiero|Peguat — Canopus&lt;br&gt;(Şân-Stele)| &lt;hiero&gt;Q3:W11-Aa18-U33-X1:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
{{Hiero|Genp — Canopus| &lt;hiero&gt;W11:W24-N1:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
{{Hiero|Gauti — Canopus| &lt;hiero&gt;W11-G1-Z7*X1:Z4-O49&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
The settlement's [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was '''Peguat''' or '''Pikuat'''.{{sfnp|''CE''|1913}} The Greeks called it Canopus ({{lang|grc|Κάνωπος}}, ''Kánōpos'') after a [[Canopus (mythology)|legendary commander]] of the era of the [[Trojan War]] supposedly buried there. The English form of the name derives from the [[Latinization of names|Latinized]] form used under [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]].

==History==
===Ancient Egypt===
Canopus was the site of a temple to the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Serapis]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

The name of Canopus appears in the first half of the 6th century BC in a poem by [[Solon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franckgoddio.org/fileadmin/pics/4_library/alexandria/EST_Content.pdf PDF file] Research by Franck Goddio&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Egyptology|Egyptological]] excavations some 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;km from the area known today as [[Abu Qir]] have revealed extensive traces of the city with its quays, and granite monuments with the name of [[Ramesses II]], but they may have been brought in for the adornment of the place at a later date. The exact date of the foundation of Canopus is unknown, but [[Herodotus]] refers to it as an ancient port. Homeric myth claims that it was founded by [[Menelaus]], and named after [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], the pilot of his ship, who died there after being bitten by a serpent.{{refn|group=n|The first reference to Canopus as the helmsman of Menelaus seems to be by [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}}} Legend describes how Menelaus built a monument to his memory on the shore, around which the town later grew up. The real origin of the name Canopus is said to be [[Ancient Egyptian]] ''Kah Nub'' (&quot;golden floor&quot;), referring likely to the profits made by merchants trading through the port. There is unlikely to be any connection with &quot;[[wikt:canopy|canopy]]&quot;. A temple to [[Osiris]] was built by king [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], but according to Herodotus, very near to Canopus was an older shrine,{{refn|group=n|This may have been a reference to the newly discovered [[Heracleion]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}}} a temple of [[Heracles]] that served as an asylum for fugitive slaves. Osiris was worshipped at Canopus under a peculiar form: that of a vase with a human head. Through an old misunderstanding, the name &quot;[[canopic jar]]s&quot; was applied by early [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] to the vases with human and animal heads in which the internal organs were placed by the Egyptians after embalming.

===Hellenistic Era===
In [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]]' ninth regnal year (239 BC), a great assembly of priests at Canopus passed an honorific decree (the &quot;[[Decree of Canopus]]&quot;) that, ''inter alia,'' conferred various new titles on the king and his consort, [[Berenice II of Egypt|Berenice]]. Three examples of this decree are now known (plus some fragments), inscribed in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in both [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and  [[demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]]) and in classical [[Greek language|Greek]], and they were second only to the more famous [[Rosetta Stone]] in providing the key to deciphering the ancient Egyptian language. This was the earliest of the series of [[bilingual]] inscriptions of the &quot;Rosetta Stone Series&quot;, also known as the [[Ptolemaic Decrees]]. There are three such Decrees altogether.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

The town had a large trade in [[henna]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}
[[File:Canopus menouthis herakleion.jpg|thumb|Map of Nile Delta showing ancient Canopus, [[Heracleion]], and [[Menouthis]]]]
===Roman Era===
In [[Ancient times|Roman times]], the town was notorious for its dissoluteness.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[Juvenal]]'s ''[[Satire VI]]'' referred to the &quot;debauchery&quot; that prevailed there. The emperor [[Hadrian]] built a [[Hadrian's Villa|villa]] at [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], 18 miles away from Rome, where he replicated for his enjoyment architectural patterns from all parts of the [[Roman Empire]]. One of these (and the most excavated and studied today) was borrowed from Canopus.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

===Modern city===
{{main|Abu Qir}}
The Egyptian city of [[Abu Qir]] (&quot;Father Cyrus&quot;), honoring two Christian martyrs, is located a few miles away from the ruins of Canopus. It is a village (around 1900 with 1000 inhabitants), at the end of a little peninsula north-east of Alexandria. It has a trade in [[quail]]s, which are caught in nets hung along the shore. Off Aboukir on 1 August 1798, the French Mediterranean fleet was destroyed within the roads by British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] on 25 July 1799. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] destroyed there a Turkish army 18,000 strong; and on 8 March 1801, the French garrison of 1,800 men was defeated by 20,000 English and Ottoman Turks commanded by Abercromby.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

==See of Canopus==
Egypt had many martyrs in the persecution of [[Diocletian]], among others St. [[Athanasia]] with her three daughters, and St. [[Cyrus and John]]. There was here a monastery called Metanoia, founded by monks from [[Tabennisi]], where many a [[patriarch of Alexandria]] took shelter during the religious quarrels of the 5th century. Two miles east of Canopus was the famous Pharaonic temple of Manouthin, afterwards destroyed by monks, and a church on the same spot dedicated to the [[Four Evangelists]]. St. [[Cyril of Alexandria]] solemnly transported the relics of the holy martyrs Cyrus and John into the church, which became an important place of [[pilgrimage]]. It was here that St. [[Sophronius of Jerusalem]] was healed of an [[ophthalmy]] that had been declared incurable by the physicians (610–619), whereupon he wrote the [[panegyric]] of the two saints with a compilation of seventy miracles worked in their sanctuary ([[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', LXXXVII, 3379-676) Canopus formed, with Menelaus and Schedia, a [[suffragan]] [[Episcopal see|see]] subject to Alexandria in the [[Roman province]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Aegyptus Prima]]; it is usually called '''Schedia''' in the ''[[Notitiae episcopatuum]]''. Two [[titular see|titulars]] are mentioned by [[Lequien]] (II, 415), one in 325, the other in 362.{{sfnp|''CE''|1913}}

'''Antinopolis''' ('''Antinoöpolis''', '''Antinoopolis''', '''Antinoë'''); ({{lang-grc|'''Ἀντινόου πόλις'''}}; {{lang-cop|'''ⲁⲛⲧⲓⲛⲱⲟⲩ'''}} ''Antinow''; modern ''Sheikh 'Ibada'') was a city founded at an older Egyptian village by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Hadrian]] to commemorate his deified young [[eromenos|beloved]], [[Antinous]], on the east bank of the [[Nile]], not far from the site in [[Upper Egypt]] where Antinous drowned in 130 AD. Antinopolis was a little to the south of the [[Egypt]]ian village of '''Besa''' ({{lang|grc|Βῆσσα}}), named after the goddess and oracle of Besa, which was consulted occasionally even as late as the age of [[Constantine I]]. Antinopolis was built at the foot of the hill upon which Besa was seated. The city is located nearly opposite of [[Hermopolis Magna]], and was connected to [[Berenice Troglodytica]] by the [[Via Hadriana]].

==History==

During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], the city was the location of [[Ramesses II]]'s great temple, dedicated to the gods of [[Hermopolis|Khmun]] and [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. The city of Antinopolis exhibited the [[Graeco-Roman]] architecture of [[Hadrian]]'s age in immediate contrast with the [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian style]]. The city was the center of the official cult of [[Antinous]]. It first belonged to the [[Heptanomis]], but under [[Diocletian]] (286 AD) Antinopolis became the capital of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of the [[Thebaid]]. According to the Greek ''[[Menaea Graeca|Menaea]]'', it was at Antinoe that [[Julian and Basilissa|Saint Julian]] underwent martyrdom during the [[Persecutions of Diocletian]]. As a cultural center, it was the native city of the 4th-century mathematician [[Serenus of Antinopolis]]. Antinopolis was still a &quot;most illustrious' city in a surviving divorce decree of 569 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Francogallica/Divorce_fran.htm &quot;Un acte de divorce par consentement mutuel&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132944/http://web.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Francogallica/Divorce_fran.htm |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antinoë was the seat of a Christian bishop by the 4th century, originally a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Ptolemais Hermiou|Ptolemais in Thebaide]], but it became a metropolitan see itself in the 5th century, having as suffragans [[Damanhur|Herrmopolis Parva]], [[Cusae]], [[Lycopolis]], [[Thebaid#Episcopal sees|Hypselis]], [[Thebaid#Episcopal sees|Apollonopolis Parva]], [[Tjebu|Antaeopolis]], [[Panopolis]] and [[Arcadia Aegypti#Episcopal sees|Theodosiopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 593-594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano Moroni, ''Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7QAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA168 Vol. 2], p.&amp;nbsp;168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaas A. Worp, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/8214/5_039_223.pdf?sequence=1 ''A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750)''], in ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 100 (1994) 283-318&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a residential bishopric, Antinoë is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 834&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was abandoned around the 10th century. It continued to host a massive [[Greco-Roman]] temple until the 19th century, when it was destroyed to feed a cement works.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality &amp; Civilization'', Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2003. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and organization==

The city of Antinopolis was governed by its own senate and ''prytaneus'' or president. The senate was chosen from the members of the wards ({{lang|grc|φυλαί}}), of which we learn the name of one &amp;ndash; {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναΐς}} &amp;ndash; from inscriptions (Orelli, No. 4705); and its decrees, as well as those of the prytaneus, were not, as usual, subject to the revision of the [[nome (Egypt)|nomarch]], but to that of the prefect ({{lang|grc|ἐπιστράτηγος}}) of the [[Thebaid]]. Divine honours were paid in the Antinoeion to Antinous as a local deity, and games and chariot-races were annually exhibited in commemoration of his death and of [[Hadrian]]'s sorrow. (Dictionary of Antiquities, s. v. {{lang|grc|Ἀντινόεια}}.)

==Archaeological finds==

The earliest finds at the site date to the [[New Kingdom]], when [[Bes]] and [[Hathor]] were important deities (ref. Princeton). A grotto, once inhabited by [[Christian]] [[anchorite]]s, probably marks the seat of the shrine and oracle, and [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]] tombs with inscriptions point to the [[necropolis]] of Antinopolis. The ruins of Antinopolis attest, by the area which they fill, the ancient grandeur of the city. The direction of the principal streets may still be traced.  The streets were built on a grid plan with roads intersecting at right angles, like the majority of Roman cities at this time, and Jomard, a member of Napoleon’s Commission d’Egypte found that the streets were divided into quarters and blocks, with each building being conveniently numbered (Bell, 1940). One at least of them, which ran from north to south, had on either side of it a corridor supported by columns for the convenience of foot-passengers. The walls of the theatre near the southern gate, and those of the hippodrome without the walls to the east, are still extant. At the north-western extremity of the city was a portico, of which four columns remain, inscribed to Good Fortune, and bearing the date of the 14th and last year of the reign of [[Alexander Severus]], 235.

[[File:Antinoë (Antinoöpolis). Vue de l'arc de triomphe.jpg|thumbnail|left|View of the triumph arc.]]
As far as can be ascertained from the space covered with mounds of masonry, Antinopolis was about a mile and a half in length, and nearly half a mile broad. The remains of the city, having a three and a half mile circumference, suggests Roman and Hellenistic foundations and was surrounded by a brick wall on three sides, leaving the fourth side open to the Nile (Bell, 1940). Near the Hippodrome are a well and tanks appertaining to an ancient road, which leads from the eastern gate to a valley behind the town, ascends the mountains, and, passing through the desert by the Wádee Tarfa, joins the roads to the quarries of the Mons Porphyrites. (Wilkinson, ''Topography of Thebes'', p.&amp;nbsp;382.)

===Albert Gayet===

Albert Gayet (1856-1916) was known as the “archaeologist of Antinopolis” and, without his extensive research and documentation of the site, very little would be known about this Greco-Roman city. Though there is much data of Antinopolis recorded from the Napoleon Commission, Albert Gayet’s report sheds a greater light on the ancient city. As Christianity began to spread through the Roman Empire, Antinopolis became a place of worship. Centuries after the city of Antinous was established by the Roman emperor, Christianity became the way of life. The city was home to many nuns and monks and sanctuaries were popping up everywhere. Many came to worship saints, such as Claudius and Colluthus, and monasteries were abundant (Donadoni, 1991). Albert Gayet’s findings confirm the wide spread of Christianity. Gayet’s excavations have revealed mummies, grave goods, and thousands of fabrics at the site of Antinopolis and he uncovered a large cemetery, the burial place of numerous Coptic Christians. Mummification was prohibited by law in the fourth century A.D., and so the remains of deceased Christians were dressed in tunics and swaddled with other textiles before being buried (Hoskins,2007). Gayet’s findings give researchers a better understanding of early Christian burial practices and his preservation of artistic textiles found at the site show the Coptic style that was evolving. The transformation of style, creating the Coptic style, was the canonical art of ancient Egypt infused with Classical and then Christian art (&quot;Textiles,&quot; 2003). The findings of Albert Gayet have provided researchers with great evidence of change throughout Antinopolis in the ancient world.

At the beginning of the 19th century, when [[Napoleon]]ic surveys were made, a theater, many temples, a triumphal arch, two streets with double colonnades, (illustrated in ''[[Description de l'Egypte]]'',) a circus, and a hippodrome nearby, were still to be seen.

==Antinopolis today==

Today not much remains of the ancient city of Antinopolis. In its place is El Sheikh Ibada, a small mud village surrounded by the crumbled ruins of what was once a city of worship. There is not much left of the ancient city, as many buildings had their materials taken to build newer structures, such as sugar factories for El-Rodah, but visitors can still see the remains of the Roman Circus and ruins of a few temples. (Stillwell, 1976).  Unfortunately the local inhabitants are today (2015) bulldozing the circus to extend a Muslim cemetery.
Some excavations were undertaken by the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], 1965-68. [[Papyrus|Papyri]] from the site were edited and translated by [[J. W. B. Barns]] and H. Zilliacus.

[[File:Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware.JPG|thumb|right|Tell el-Yehudiyeh ware juglets. [[Rockefeller Museum]]]]
'''Leontopolis''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Ney-ta-hut'') is the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the modern area of '''Tell el Yehudiye''' or '''Tell el-Yahudiya''' (Egyptian Arabic: ''Mound of the [[Jews]]''). It was an ancient city of [[Egypt]] in the 13th [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]] (the [[Heliopolite Nome]]), on the Pelusiac branch of the [[Nile]].

This site is known for its distinctive pottery known as [[Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware]].

==Discovery==
The site was identified in 1825 by [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Linant]],&lt;ref&gt;Naville, 1890, p5, &quot;the first account... who visited the place in 1825&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linant, [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/linant_de_bellefonds1873text/0157?sid=79870f2608af5cf329785a521a8ac207 Memoires], p.139: &quot;Oniosa, Castra Jndceorum. — A 20 kilomètres d'Héliopolis, au nord, on voit un grand monticule de décombres qui sont les restes d'une très-grande ville : ce monticule se nomme Tel-Yeuhoud ou Monticule des Juifs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and earlier was identified by Niebuhr in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z5LkAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;pg=PA152 Niebuhr in Egypt], p151-152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthwork enclosures==
[[File:Egypte louvre 120 asiatique.jpg|thumb|Head of an Asiatic prisoner, earthenware, fragment, Tell el-Yahoudiyeh (1184–1153 BCE)]]
[[File:Egypte louvre 121 ennemi.jpg|thumb|Faience decoration of an enemy. From the palace of Ramses III at Tell el-Yahudiya. [[Louvre]]]]
The site includes some massive rectangular earthwork enclosures of the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] or [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. They measure around 515m by 490m, and their purpose is probably defensive.

These earthen walls were sloping and plastered on the outer face, and almost vertical on the inner face. Egyptian parallels for such a structure are lacking. This enclosure is often interpreted as a fortification built by the Hyksos; it is generally known as the &quot;Hyksos Camp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egyptsites.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/tell-el-yahudiya/ Tell el-Yahudiya] at egyptsites.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also cemeteries from the Middle Kingdom and later.

A temple and palace of [[Ramesses II]] has also been excavated.

Also, there was a palace of [[Ramesses III]] with some fine decorations.

==Jewish temple==
In the reign of [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (180–145 BC) [[Land of Onias|a temple]], modelled after that of [[Jerusalem]], was founded by the exiled [[Jew]]ish priest [[Onias IV]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus|Joseph.]] ''Ant. Jud.'' xiii. 3. § 3; Hieronym. ''in Daniel.'' ch. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew colony, which was attracted by the establishment of their national worship at Leontopolis, and which was increased by the refugees from the oppressions of the [[Seleucid]] kings in [[Judea]], flourished there for more than three centuries afterwards. After the outbreak of the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish War]], the Leontopolite temple was closed in the first century CE, amid the general backlash against [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph. ''B. Jud.'' vii. 10. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Thirthieth Dynasty and nearby, on the same banks of this branch of the Nile River, was [[Behbeit El Hagar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IrisTempleSite&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=John Gardner|title=Modern Egypt and Thebes|date=September 5, 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781108065092|page=412|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bY0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA412&amp;dq=sebennytus&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=sebennytus&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebennytos was anciently a place of some importance, and standing on a peninsula, between a lake ({{lang|grc|λίμνη Σεβεννυτική}}, now called [[Burlos]]) and the Nile, was favorably seated for trade and intercourse with Lower Egypt and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. The neglect of the canals, however, and the elevation of the alluvial soil have nearly obliterated its site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jean-François |last1=Champollion|title=l'Egypte'', vol. ii|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sebennytos is perhaps best known as the hometown of [[Manetho]], a [[historian]] and [[chronicler]] from the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic era]], c. 3rd century BC. Sebennytos was also the hometown of [[Nectanebo II]], and he was its last ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Manley, The Seventy Great Mysteries of Ancient Egypt&quot; Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, 2003. p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[temple]] dedicated to the local god [[Onuris]], or Onuris-[[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], and his lioness goddess mate [[Mehit]], once existed at this location but is now reduced to ruins. A fragment to where kings would have made offerings to Onuris and his wife, is on display at the [[Walters Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehit&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watterson|first1=Barbara|title=Gods of Ancient Egypt - Tefnut Chapter|date=2003|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752495026|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9wTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;dq=Sebennytos&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8ypTR7ZHQAhXC3SYKHRZJDDsQ6AEIXzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Sebennytos&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also known as part of the route of the [[Holy Family]] during their time in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolyFamily&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Holy Family at Meniet Samanoud|url=http://www.touregypt.net/holyfamily.htm|website=Tour Egypt|accessdate=6 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912231331/http://www.touregypt.net/holyfamily.htm|archivedate=12 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Lahun''' ({{lang-ar|اللاهون}} ''El Lāhūn,'' {{Lang-cop|ⲗⲉϩⲱⲛⲉ}} alt. '''Illahun''', '''Lahun''', or '''Kahun''' [the latter being a [[neologism]] coined by archaeologist [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]]]) is a village in [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]. Associated with the [[Pyramid of Senusret II]] ({{lang-gr|Sesostris II}}), it is located near the modern village, and is often known by the same name. Also nearby is the pyramid itself, known as the ''Pyramid of Lahun''. The ancient name of the site was ''rꜣ-ḥn.t'', literally, &quot;Mouth (or Opening) of the Canal&quot;).

==Overview==

Like the other [[Twelfth Dynasty]] pyramids in the [[Faiyum]], the Pyramid of Lahun is made of mud brick, but here the core of the pyramid consists of a network of stone walls that were infilled by mud brick. This approach was probably intended to ensure the stability of the brick structure. Unusually, despite a Pyramid Temple on the east side, the entrance to the pyramid is on the south. The archaeologist [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Flinders Petrie]] nevertheless spent considerable time searching for it on the east side. He discovered the entrance only when workmen clearing the nearby tombs of the nobles discovered a small tunnel at the bottom of a 40-foot shaft, which led to the royal burial chamber. Evidently the original workmen on the tomb had used their legitimate activity as a cover for digging this tunnel, which enabled them to rob the pyramid. Once he was in the burial chamber, Petrie was able to work backwards to the entrance.

The pyramid stands on an artificial terrace cut from sloping ground. On the north side eight rectangular blocks of stone were left to serve as [[mastabas]], probably for the burial of personages associated with the royal court. In front of each mastaba is a narrow shaft leading down to the burial chamber underneath. Also on the north side is the Queen's Pyramid or subsidiary pyramid.

The most remarkable discovery was that of the village of the workers who both constructed the pyramid and then served the funerary cult of the king. The village, conventionally known as Kahun, is about 800 meters from the pyramid and lies in the desert a short distance from the edge of cultivation. When found, many of the buildings were extant up to roof height, and Petrie confirmed that the true arch was known and used by the workmen in the village. However, all the buildings found were demolished in the process of excavation, which proceeded in long strips down the length of the village. When the first strip had been cleared, mapped and drawn, the next strip was excavated and the spoil dumped in the previous strip. As a result, there is very little to be seen on the site today.

The village was excavated by Petrie in 1888-90 and again in 1914. The excavation was remarkable for the number, range, and quality of objects of everyday life (including tools) that were found in the houses. According to Dr Rosalie David's ''Pyramid Builders of Ancient Egypt,'' &quot;the quantity, range and type of articles of everyday use which were left behind in the houses may indeed suggest that the departure [of the workmen] was sudden and unpremeditated&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;199).

Among the curiosities found there were wooden boxes buried beneath the floors of many of the houses. When opened they were found to contain the skeletons of infants, sometimes two or three in a box, and aged only a few months at death. Petrie reburied these human remains in the desert.

[[File:PKahun VI1-12.jpg|thumb|260px|[[12th Dynasty]] medical papyrus found at El Lahun]]
Also found in the town were the ''[[Kahun Papyrus|Kahun papyri]]'', comprising about 1000 fragments, covering legal and medical matters.  Re-excavation of the area in 2009 by Egyptian archaeologists revealed a cache of pharaonic-era mummies in brightly painted wooden coffins in the sand-covered desert rock surrounding the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090426/sc_nm/us_egypt_mummies_1 Johnson, C. Cache of mummies unearthed at Egypt's Lahun pyramid. April 26, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was occupied into the late [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]], and then again in the [[New Kingdom]], when there were large land reclamation schemes in the area.

==Town layout==
The town was laid out in a regular plan, with mud-brick town walls on 3 sides. No evidence was found of a fourth wall, which may have collapsed and been washed away during the annual inundation. The town was rectangular in shape and was divided internally by a mudbrick wall as large and strong as the exterior walls. This wall divided about one third of the area of the town and in this smaller area the houses consisted of rows of back-to-back, side-by-side single room houses. The larger area, which was higher up the slope and thus benefited from whatever breeze was blowing, contained a much smaller number of large, multi-room villas. 
The size of the houses ranged from 2,520 square meters for the elite houses to 120 square meters for small houses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Planned Town of the Middle Kingdom: Kahun.&quot; Arts and Humanities Through the Eras. Gale. 2005. Retrieved August 13, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427400025.html&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie compared the village to a Welsh mining village, where the workers lived in terraces in the valley while the mine owner and overseers lived in larger houses up the hill.

A major feature of the town was the so-called ‘acropolis’ building. This was an important building, as indicated by the presence of column bases. Petrie suggested that this may have been the King’s residence whilst he was visiting construction work. The building seems to have been out of use and derelict before the end of occupation.

Other records show that there were a large number of Semitic slaves in Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty &lt;ref&gt;&quot;on stelae and in papyri Asiatic slaves are increasingly often mentioned, though there is no means of telling whether they were prisoners of war or had infiltrated into Egypt of their own accord.&quot; Gardiner, &quot;Egypt of the Pharaohs&quot;, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting that some of the villas were constructed of layers of mudbrick separated by layers of reed matting, a technique used in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, burial beneath the living quarters of a house was a custom noted at Ur by Woolley. It is possible that the workers who were so carefully guarded by the village wall and separated from the overseers by an equally strong wall were Semitic (Asiatic) slaves not trusted by their overseers.

It was announced by the Supreme Council of Antiquities on 26 April 2009 that an anthology of pharaonic-era mummies in vividly painted wooden coffins were uncovered near the Lahun pyramid in Egypt. The sarcophagi were decorated with bright hues of green, red and white bearing images of their occupants.  Archaeologists unearthed dozens of mummies, thirty of which were very well preserved with prayers purposed to help the deceased in the afterlife inscribed upon them. The site, once enveloped in slabs of white limestone, revealed that it could possibly be thousands of years older than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1677296/new_cache_of_mummies_discovered_in_egypt/index.html|title=New Cache Of Mummies Discovered In Egypt - Redorbit|last=redOrbit|date=2009-04-27|work=Redorbit|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts think that a new understanding of Egyptian funerary architecture and customs of the Middle Pharaonic Kingdom all the way to the Roman era could be learned from the exploration of the dozens of tombs encompassing the site near the Lahun, Egypt’s southernmost pyramid.   &quot;The tombs were cut on the rock itself, and they vary in architectural designs,&quot; said archaeologist Abdul Rahman Al-Ayedi, head of excavations at the site. .  Some of the tombs were erected on top of gravesites from earlier eras.  Ayedi told reporters, &quot;The prevailing idea was that this site has been established by [[Senusret II]], the fourth king of the 12th dynasty. But in light of our discovery, I think we are going to change this theory, and soon we will announce another discovery.&quot;  He said teams had made a discovery of an artifact that was dated earlier than the 12th dynasty, but did not include any specifics on the item and promised an official statement would be made within days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1677296/new_cache_of_mummies_discovered_in_egypt/index.html|title=New Cache Of Mummies Discovered In Egypt - Redorbit|last=redOrbit|date=2009-04-27|work=Redorbit|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities announced May 23, 2010 that 57 ancient Egyptian tombs were discovered in an area close to Lahun.   Most of the graves contained an ornamental painted wooden sarcophagus with a mummy inside.   Some of the tombs date from the Egyptian [[First dynasty of Egypt|First]] and [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second]] Dynasties, as far back as 2750 BC{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Several of the sites were decorated with hieroglyphics that the ancients believed would help the deceased travel through the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1869258/archeologists_find_new_tombs_in_egypt/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve of the tombs were found to belong to the [[18th dynasty]] which ruled Egypt during the second millennium BC. Egypt's archaeology chief, [[Zahi Hawass]], said the mummies that date to the 18th dynasty are covered in linen decorated with religious texts from the Book of the Dead and scenes of ancient Egyptian deities. The discovery might help experts have a better understanding of the ancient Egyptian religions.   Some of the tombs are decorated with religious texts that ancient Egyptians believed would help the deceased cross over to the underworld, said [[Abdel Rahman El-Aydi]], chief archeologist of project.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1869258/archeologists_find_new_tombs_in_egypt/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Aydi said one of the oldest tombs is almost completely intact, with all of its funerary equipment and a wooden sarcophagus containing a mummy wrapped in linen.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1869258/archeologists_find_new_tombs_in_egypt/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 31 of the tombs, dating back to around 2030 - 1840 B.C., during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] Era, archeologists found scenes of different ancient Egyptian deities such as [[Horus]], [[Amun]], [[Hathor]], &amp; [[Khnum]] decorated on the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1869258/archeologists_find_new_tombs_in_egypt/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heracleopolis Magna''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μεγάλη Ἡρακλέους πόλις}}, ''Megálē Herakléous pólis'') or '''Heracleopolis''' ({{lang|grc|Ἡρακλεόπολις}}, ''Herakleópolis'') is the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name of the capital of the 20th [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[ancient Egypt|ancient]] [[Upper Egypt]]. The site is located approximately {{convert|15|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} west of the modern city of [[Beni Suef]], in the [[Beni Suef Governorate]] of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, 2008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|location = Oxford|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
In [[Ancient Egypt]], Heracleopolis Magna was known in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as the &quot;'''House of the Royal Child'''&quot; (variously rendered as ''Henen-nesut'', ''Nen-nesu'', or ''Hwt-nen-nesu''). The Greek name meant &quot;City of [[Heracles]]&quot;, with the epithet &quot;great&quot; being added to distinguish it from [[Heracleopolis (disambiguation)|other towns with that name]]. The Greek form became more common under the [[Macedonian Empire|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemid dynasty]], who came to power after the death of [[Alexander the Great]].
The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] used a [[latinization of names|latinized]] form of the Greek name but the town was by then known locally as Ehnasya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This later developed into ''Hnas'' ({{lang-cop|'''Ϩⲛⲏⲥ'''}}) and ''Ahnas'' ({{lang-arz|اهناس}}). The site is now known in [[Egyptian Arabic]] as ''Ihnasiya Umm al-Kimam'' (&quot;Mother of the Shards&quot;) and as ''Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah''.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, 2008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|location = Oxford|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology of important occupations==

===Early Dynastic Period===
The date of the earliest settlements on the site of Herakleopolis is not known, but an entry on the [[Palermo Stone]] reporting king [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]]'s visit to the sacred lake of [[Heryshef]] at ''Nenj-neswt'', the ancient name of the city, suggests that it was already in existence by the mid [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], c. 2970 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Wilkinson: ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, London/New York 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-18633-1}} p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schäfer: ''Ein Bruchstück altägyptischer Annalen'', (= Abhandlungen der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Anhang: Abhandlungen nicht zur Akademie gehöriger Gelehrter. Philosophische und historische Abhandlungen. 1902, 1. Quartal). Verlag der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1902, p. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Intermediate Period (2181–2055 BC)===
[[File:Relieve tumba Satbahetep (M.A.N. Inv.1976-114-A-2080) 02.jpg|thumb|Partial view of the bas-relief from the north wall of a funerary chapel containing the tombs of district governor Neferkhau-(Nfr-khaU) and a woman named Sat-Bahetep (probably his wife)-(Sa-t, Ba-htp), dated between [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|9th]] and [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th dynasties]]. It shows a funerary food-offering ritual for Sat-Baheteps's [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|ka]] (between 2160 and 1990 BC).]]

Herakleopolis first came to prominence and reached its apogee of power during the [[First Intermediate Period]], between 2181-2055 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually after the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt was divided into [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]]. Herakleopolis became the principal city of Lower Egypt and was able to exercise its control over much of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, 2008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|location = Oxford|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herakleopolis exerted such great control over Lower Egypt during this time that [[Egyptologists]] and Egyptian Archaeologists sometimes refer to the period between the 9th and 10th Dynasties (2160-2025 BC) as the Herakleopolitan Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, 2008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|location = Oxford|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, Herakleopolis often found itself in conflict with the de facto capital of Upper Egypt, ancient [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BC)===

Between the latter part of the [[First Intermediate Period]] and the early [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the city became religious center of the cult of [[Heryshef]], and the Temple of Heryshef was constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heracleopolis Magna and its dynasty was defeated by [[Mentuhotep II]] in ca. 2055-2004 B.C., which ushered in the Middle Kingdom period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van De Mieroop|first1=Marc|title=A History of Ancient Egypt|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-6070-4|pages=97, 99|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Intermediate Period (1069–747 BC)===

By the time of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] (1069-747 BC), Herakleopolis again rose in importance.  There were many renovations and new constructions of the temple and mortuary centers that existed in the city, and it again became an important religious and political center.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ptolemaic Egypt (322–30 BC)===

By the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]] of Egypt (332–30 BC), Herakleopolis was still an important religious and cultural center in Egypt. The Greek rulers of this period, in an attempt to find connections and comparisons between their own gods and the gods of the land that they were now ruling, decided to associate the local god [[Heryshef]] with their god [[Heracles]], thus the name often used by modern scholars for Herakleopolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Egypt (30 BC–390 AD)===

The site of Herakleopolis was occupied even into [[Roman Egypt|Roman times]]. Near the Necropolis of Sedmet el-Gebel, houses dating to this period were found,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in and of itself implies a continued occupation of the area.

==Archaeological excavations==

===Sir Flinders Petrie and Edouard Naville===
[[File:Pottery ushabti (shabti, shawabti) with linen grave clothes of T3y-ms. 19th Dynasty. From Heracleopolis Magna, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Pottery [[ushabti]] from Heracleopolis Magna with linen grave clothes of T3y-ms. 19th Dynasty. ([[Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology]], London)]]
The first person to undertake an extensive excavation at Herakleopolis was the Swiss Egyptologist [[Édouard Naville|Edouard Naville]]. After excavating what he believed to be the entirety of the Temple of Heryshef, Naville came to the conclusion that he had found all that Herakleopolis had to offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His friend [[Sir Flinders Petrie]], on the other hand, “...in 1879 suspected that the region already cleared was only a part of the temple,” &lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Herakleopolis (or Ehnasya as he called it, a name harking back to the site's period of Roman occupation) had much left to be unearthed.

Petrie discovered a great deal that Naville had not believed existed. He completed the excavation of the temple of Heryshef, and attempted to find other remains in an area around the temple. In so doing, he succeeded in discovering such previously unknown features as house remains from the Roman period of occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also identified another temple that he attributed to the 19th Dynasty, as well as the aforementioned additions to the Temple of Heryshef associated with [[Ramses the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other than archaeological features, the artefacts found by Petrie during his excavation are numerous, and span the entire chronological range of settlement. Relating specifically to artefacts found at the end of the First Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Petrie uncovered numerous pot sherds he associated with the 11th Dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the later Roman periods, Petrie found numerous objects associated with many of the mortuary sites that he unearthed, including iron tools, pottery, and icons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehnasya 1904&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ehnasya 1904.|publisher = Gilbert and Rivington Limited|location = London|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent excavations===

While other excavations are few and naturally overshadowed by that of Flinders Petrie and his famous expedition, there have been several more recent excavations that also increased knowledge of the site. During the 1980s, a Spanish team conducted excavations and uncovered such artefacts as a libation altar and a pair of decorated eyes presumably from a statue, all attributed with a temple dated to the Third Intermediate Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Princeton Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, 2008.|publisher = Princeton University Press|location = Princeton|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish team also conducted excavations as late as 2008, under the direction of María del Carmen Pérez-Die of the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid, Spain. Their efforts revealed a previously unknown tomb with several false doors dating to the First Intermediate Period, as well as funeral offerings, all of which had not been vandalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080225-egypt-tomb.html |title=

'''New Kalabsha''' is a [[promontory]] located near [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, facts on File 1993. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; It houses several important temples, structures, and other remains that have been relocated here from the site of Old Kalabsha (''{{lang-ar|Bab al-Kalabsha}}'', &quot;Gate of Kalabsha&quot; {{lang-grc|Ταλμις}}, ''Talmis'') and other sites in Lower Nubia, to avoid the rising waters of [[Lake Nasser]] caused by the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]]. The major remains are described below:

==Kalabsha Temple==
[[Image:The Temple of Kalabsha by Dennis G. Jarvis.jpg|right|thumb|Temple of Kalabsha]]
{{main|Temple of Kalabsha}}
The '''Temple of Kalabsha''' (or Temple of [[Mandulis]]) is the major structure in New Kalabsha. The entire [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Period temple to the sun god [[Mandulis]] was relocated here in 1970. It was built by [[Emperor]] [[Augustus]] and was the largest free-standing temple of Egyptian [[Nubia]]. During relocation, the temple was cut into 13,000 blocks.

==Gerf Hussein==
[[Image:The temple of Gerf Hussein by George Snyder.jpg|right|thumb|Gerf Hussein]]
{{main|Gerf Hussein}}
The temple of '''Gerf Hussein''' (originally known as ''Per Ptah'', the &quot;House of [[Ptah]]&quot;) is dedicated to [[Ramesses II]] and was built by the Viceroy of [[Nubia]] [[Setau]]. Originally, it was partially free-standing and partially rock-cut. During the flooding of [[Lake Nasser]], the free-standing section was dismantled and then rebuilt at New Kalabsha. Most of the rock-cut temple was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters.
{{clear}}
==Beit el-Wali==
[[Image:Hémispéos Beit el Wali.jpg|right|thumb|Beit el-Wali]]
{{main|Beit el-Wali}}
The rock-cut temple of '''Beit el-Wali''' was moved from its original location by a Polish archaeological team. It is dedicated to [[Ramesses II]], and the gods of [[Amun]] and [[Anukis]] (among others). It was originally decorated in bright colors, but these were mostly removed by a &quot;squeeze&quot;&lt;!--?--&gt; taken in the 19th Century (the results of this squeeze are now on display in the [[British Museum]]).
{{clear}}
==Kiosk of Qertassi==
[[Image:Kiosk von Kertassi 03.JPG|right|thumb|Kiosk of Qertassi]]
{{main|Kiosk of Qertassi}}
The '''Kiosk of Qertassi''' is &quot;a tiny Roman kiosk with four slender papyrus columns inside [and] two Hathor columns at the entrance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago.

Vol.7 No.2 (April 15, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small but elegant structure that &quot;is unfinished and not inscribed with the name of the architect, but is probably contemporary with [[Trajan]]'s Kiosk at Philae.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson: ''Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt.'' Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
==Dedwen==
{{main|Temple of Dedwen}}
Originally located within the outer wall of the temple of Kalabsha, and is dedicated to the [[Nubia]]n serpent goddess, [[Dedwen]]. It was moved along with the Kalabsha temple to New Kalabsha.

'''Armant''' (ancient Egyptian '''Iuny'''; [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|ⲉⲣⲙⲉⲛⲧ}} '''Erment'''; known in [[Greek language|Greek]] as '''Hermonthis'''), is a town located about 12 miles south of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], in [[Egypt]]. It was an important [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] town, which was enlarged during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. It is located today in the [[Luxor Governorate]], on the west bank of the [[Nile]]. The modern name of the city derives from ''Iunu-Montu''.

==History==
[[Montu]] was an [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian god]] whose name means &quot;nomad&quot;. Montu was associated with raging bulls, strength and war. He was also said to manifest himself in a white bull with a black face, which was referred to as the [[Buchis|Bakha]]. Egypt's greatest general-kings called themselves Mighty Bulls, the sons of Montu. In the famous narrative of the Battle of Kadesh, [[Ramesses II]] was said to have seen the enemy and &quot;raged at them like Montu, Lord of Thebes&quot;.

From Armant, Egypt]]
A temple dedicated to [[Montu]] existed at Hermonthis as early as the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh dynasty]], which perhaps originated at Hermonthis. [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] is the earliest builder known with certainty. Important additions were made during the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth dynasty]] and during the [[New Kingdom]]. Destroyed during the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], a new temple was started in the reign of [[Nectanebo II]] and was continued by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]]. [[Cleopatra VII]] and [[Caesarion|Ptolemy XV Caesarion]] added a birth house with a sacred lake. The building remained visible until the [[Nineteenth Century]], when it was recycled to build a sugar factory. Only the remains of the pylon of [[Thutmose III]] are visible today.

Two gates, one of them built by [[Antoninus Pius]], have also been found. The Bucheum, the burial place of the sacred [[Buchis]] bulls of Hermonthis, is on the desert edge north of the city. The earliest bull burial dates to [[Nectanebo II]], and the complex remained in use until the mid 4th century AD. The burial place of the ''Mother of Buchis'' cows has also been located. Extensive cemeteries of all periods are found in the neighbourhood of Hermonthis.

Under [[Cleopatra VII]], Hermonthis became the capital of the 4th Upper Egyptian nome. The city remained in use during the [[Copt]]ic era.

'''Akoris''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: '''Mer-nefer(et)''' ([[Old Kingdom|Old]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]s), '''Per-Imen-mat-khent(j)''' (New Kingdom), or '''Dehenet''' (since [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]]) is the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the modern [[Egypt]]ian village of {{transl|ar|DIN|Ṭihnā al-Ǧabal}} (Arabic {{lang|ar|طهنا الجبل}}), located about 12&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Al Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]]. The ancient site is situated in the southeast of the modern village.

== Location ==

Akoris is located on the east bank of the Nile, at and below the [[limestone]] cliffs about 12&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Al Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]]. The limestone cliffs at the east side of the place are divided here by a valley, the {{transl|ar|DIN|al-Wādī aṭ-Ṭihnāwī}} (Arabic الوادي الطهناوي). The southern rock looks like a lying lion.

== Names of the site ==

The site was named with several names. In the Old and Middle Kingdoms ''Mer-nefer(et)'' (''nice channel'') was used. In the New Kingdom the site was named ''Per-Imen-m3t-khent(j)'' (''The house of Amun the foremost lion''). In the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late period]] (from 26th dynasty) it was named ''T3-dehenet'' (''the cliff top'').

In Greek times the names of Ἄκωρις (Akoris or in Latin Acoris) or Τῆνις (Tēnis) were given. The name of Akoris can be found in the third line of the rock stele of [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] at this site.

== History ==

[[File:Tihna el-Gebel 02.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Amun (Akoris)]]
The site was settled since the [[Old Kingdom]]. It was an important administrative town in the 17th upper-Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] in all ancient Egyptian times. Maybe a [[Nile]] [[port]] belonged to the town. A lot of tombs were created in the rocks. They belonged to the officials of the Old Kingdom and the priests of the Late Period.

Archaeological remains came only from the [[New Kingdom]] and earlier times. In the New Kingdom the Temple of [[Amun]] was established in a former Old Kingdom tomb by Ramesses II and enlarged by Ramesses III. It is assumed that a fortress was established at this site in Persian times because of the strategic location of the town but no part of the fortress remains.

Akoris became an important town during the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, and its name was changed to Akoris. The today’s settlement traces came from the Roman and Coptic times.

== Monuments ==

Akoris is home to several archaeological sites, including a number of rock-cut tombs from the [[Old Kingdom]] period, known as [[Fraser Tombs]] (about 2&amp;nbsp;km south of Akoris). Akoris comprises also two temples from early Egyptian history ([[New Kingdom]] until the Roman period), a rock chapel (called rock chapel C), a Greek funeral chapel (formerly called “Roman temple”), two rock stelae of [[Ramesses III]], a rock stele of [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]], a stele of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and the Gemini twins [[Castor and Pollux]] and a necropolis from the Greek and Roman periods. These monuments are scattered for about 3&amp;nbsp;km along the desert and the limestone rocks.

== Gods ==

The gods are related to the site location and shape of the rocks. The earliest goddess of this site is maybe a lion goddess. From the Fraser Tombs the goddess [[Hathor]], mistress of the valley entrance, is known (time of [[Menkaura]], 4th dynasty). Starting from the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] the god [[Amun]] the foremost lion is adored. The god [[Sobek]], Lord of Behet (Lord of the mouth of the desert path), was added at the 26. dynasty and became later the main god of the site. Other gods like [[Thoth]], [[Isis]] and/or [[Mut]], [[Osiris]], [[Horus]] and [[Khonsu]] were adored from Greek-Roman times.

== Mining ==

Like similar sites in the north and south of Akoris, this site was used as a limestone quarry in ancient times.

== Excavations ==

This site was firstly known from the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]′s expedition. A more comprehensive investigation was made by the German expedition conducted by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] in the 1850s. At the beginning of the 20th century further investigations were made by [[Ahmed Kamal (Egyptologist)|Ahmed Kamal]] and [[Gustave Lefebvre]]. Since 1981 new comprehensive excavations have been carried out by a Japanese team under H. Kawanishi.  They uncovered a fine but fragmentary wooden boat model with many rowers of Middle Kingdom. Since 2002, they have investigated the southern part of the site and uncovered the TIP town.

The so-called [[Fraser Tombs]] were firstly discovered by the German Egyptologist [[Heinrich Brugsch]] in 1853 and firstly described by the British civil engineer [[George Willoughby Fraser]] half a century later.

[[File:Lepsius-Expedition-Cheops-Pyramide.jpg|thumb|300px|Members of the Prussian expedition to Egypt celebrate [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]'s birthday on the summit of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]]]
The '''Lepsius list of pyramids''' is a list of sixty-seven [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient]] [[Egyptian pyramids]] established in 1842–1843 by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810–1884), an [[Egyptologist]] and leader of the &quot;Prussian expedition to Egypt&quot; from 1842 until 1846.

The Lepsius list of pyramid is the first attempt at systematically listing all the Egyptian pyramids, and as such, is a pioneering effort of early modern Egyptology. The list was published together with the results of the expedition in Lepsius work ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien'' (1849–1859).

==List==

===History===
[[File:Carl_Richard_Lepsius_(1810-1884).jpg|thumb|170px|Karl Richard Lepsius]]
Following the success of the [[Jean-François Champollion#Franco-Tuscan Expedition|Franco-Tuscan Expedition]] to Egypt under the leadership of [[Jean-François Champollion]], the [[Prussia]]n scientists [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]] and the minister of instruction Johann Eichhorn recommended to king [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] that an expedition be sent to Egypt.
Karl Richard Lepsius, who had learned of Champollion's method to decipher the [[hieroglyphs]] and had met [[Ippolito Rosellini]] of the Franco-Tuscan Expedition, was chosen to lead it.{{sfn|Peck|2001|p=289}} The main aim of the expedition was to explore and record the remains of the ancient Egyptian civilization as well as to gather materials for the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]].

The Prussian expedition assembled in [[Alexandria]] in 1842 and quickly departed for [[Giza]], which was reached in November that same year. Proceeding north to south, Lepsius' men then explored the pyramids field of [[Abusir]], [[Saqqara]], [[Dahshur]] and, in 1843, [[Hawara]]. Lepsius and its team stayed for 6 months in total at these locations as the Prussian expedition was the first study and record Old Kingdom material in depth.{{sfn|Peck|2001|p=289}}
In total, Lepsius and his men uncovered a total of 67 pyramids and 130 tombs.{{sfn|Peck|2001|p=289}} The pyramids, dating from the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] (c. 2686–2613 BCE) until the [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] (c. 1800–1650 BCE), were given [[roman numeral]]s from north to south, starting from [[Abu Rawash]] in the north. Although a few of the structures reported by Lepsius are now known to have been [[mastabas]] and other monumental structures (highlighted on the list below in light gray), the Lepsius list of pyramids is still considered a pioneering achievement of modern Egyptology. Lepsius' numerals have remained the standard designation for some of the pyramids.

The results of the Prussian expedition to Egypt, comprising the list of pyramids, were published in the ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien''.{{sfn|Lepsius Denkmaler|2016}}

[[File:Obelisk2.jpg|thumb|The unfinished obelisk in its quarry at Aswan, 1990]]
[[File:Assuan 07.jpg|thumb|The unfinished obelisk of Aswan]]
The '''unfinished obelisk''' is the largest known ancient [[obelisk]] and is located in the northern region of the [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] in [[Aswan]] (Assuan), [[Egypt]]. 

==History of the obelisk==
Its creation was ordered by [[Hatshepsut]] (1508–1458 BC), possibly to complement what would later be known as the [[Lateran Obelisk]] (which was originally at [[Karnak]], and was later brought to the [[San_Giovanni_Laterano#Lateran_Palace|Lateran Palace]] in Rome). The unfinished obelisk is nearly one-third larger than any [[ancient Egyptian]] obelisk ever erected. If finished it would have measured around 42 m (approximately 137 feet) and would have weighed  nearly 1,090 metric tons (1,200 tons), a weight equal to about 200 African elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = Kathryn | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | date = 1999 | location =  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA587&amp;dq=%22unfinished+obelisk%22&amp;ei=xcBDSIyRJ8PSiwHU-6CIBQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ZuCjFuemBUYbCCSUlTjSkNi6M8o | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-415-18589-9| page = 587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obelisk's creators began to carve it directly out of [[bedrock]], but cracks appeared in the granite and the project was abandoned. The bottom side of the obelisk is still attached to the bedrock. 

The unfinished obelisk offers unusual insights into ancient Egyptian stone-working techniques, with marks from workers' tools still clearly visible as well as ocher-colored lines marking where they were working.

Besides the unfinished obelisk, an unfinished, partly worked obelisk base was discovered in 2005 at the [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarries of Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quarryscapes.no/news_dec1_05.php|title=QuarryScapes|website=www.quarryscapes.no|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also discovered were some rock carvings and remains that may correspond to the site where most of the famous obelisks were worked. All these quarries in Aswan and the unfinished objects are an [[open-air museum]] and are officially protected by the Egyptian government as an archeological site.

'''Avaris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|r|ᵻ|s}}; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ḥw.t wꜥr.t, sometimes transcribed ''Hut-waret'' in works for a popular audience, {{lang-el|Αὔαρις}}, {{lang|el-Latn|Auaris}})&lt;ref&gt;Holladay, John S.

It was located at modern [[Tell el-Dab'a]] in the northeastern region of the [[Nile Delta]], at the juncture of the 8th, 14th, 19th and 20th [[Nome (Egypt)|Nomes]].&lt;ref&gt;Baines and Malek &quot;Atlas of Ancient Egypt&quot; p 15 nome list and map, p 167 enlarged map of the delta.&lt;/ref&gt; As the main course of the Nile migrated eastward, its position at the hub of Egypt's delta emporia made it a major administrative capital of the [[Hyksos]] and other traders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Grant|title=The rise of the Greeks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vl-MgnNXpmQC|year=2005|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble Books]] |isbn=978-0-7607-7000-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was occupied from about 1783 to 1550&amp;nbsp;BC, or from the [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] through the second intermediate period until its destruction by [[Ahmose I]], the first Pharaoh of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]]. The name in the [[Egyptian language]] of the 2nd millennium BC was probably pronounced '''*Ḥaʔat-Wūrat''' 'Great House' and denotes the capital of an administrative division of the land. Today, the name ''Hawara'' survives, referring to the site at the entrance to [[Faiyum]]. Alternatively, [[Clement of Alexandria]] referred to the name of this city as &quot;Athyria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'And his remarks are to the following effect: Amosis, who lived in the time of the Argive Inachus, overthrew Athyria, as Ptolemy of Mendes [via Manetho] relates in his Chronology.' -- Clement of Alexandria 1.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:ScarabBearingNameOfApophis MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Scarab (artifact)|Scarab]] bearing the name of the Hyksos King [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apepi]], now at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]

In 1885, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Édouard Naville]] started the first excavations in the area around Tell-el-Daba. Between 1941 and 1942, [[Labib Habachi]], an [[Egypt]]ian [[Egyptologist]] first forwarded the idea that the site could be identified with Avaris. Between 1966 and 1969 and since 1975, the site has been excavated by the [[Austrian Archaeological Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tell el-Dab'a - History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auaris.at/html/history_en.html|title=Tell el-Dab'a - History|publisher=Tell el-Dab'a-Homepage|accessdate=2010-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626102217/http://www.auaris.at/html/history_en.html| archivedate= 26 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using radar imaging technology, its scientists could identify in 2010 the outline of the city including streets, houses, a port, and a side arm of the River Nile passing through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10367930.stm|title=Ancient Egyptian city located in Nile Delta by radar|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at Tell el-Dab'a, covering an area of about 2 square kilometers, is in ruins today, but excavations have shown that, at one point, it was a well-developed center of trade with a busy harbour catering to over 300 ships during a trading season.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hyksos Period in Egypt|author=Booth, C.|date=2005|publisher=Shire|isbn=9780747806387|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=srQmRwVozvkC&amp;pg=PA40|page=40|accessdate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts excavated at a temple erected in the Hyksos period have produced goods from all over the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] world. The temple even has [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-like wall paintings that are similar to those found on [[Crete]] at the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]]. A large [[mudbrick]] tomb has also been excavated to the west of the temple, where [[Grave goods|grave-goods]], such as copper swords, have been found.

Towards the end of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]], [[Kamose]], the last king of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], besieged Avaris, but could not dislodge the Hyksos, who were finally expelled some 18 years later (c. 1550&amp;nbsp;BC) by [[Ahmose I]], the founder of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Some claim that Kamose and Ahmose were the same person and that, after the capture of Avaris and the expulsion of the Hyksos made the founding of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] possible, Kamose changed his name (see discussion in Baines and Ma'lek)&lt;/ref&gt; The Eighteenth Dynasty-based themselves in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and Avaris was largely abandoned, its former citadel becoming the site first of enormous storage facilities, including numerous silos and then a military camp, until finally a new palatial compound of the 18th Dynasty was constructed on top of the camps and soldier graves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tell el-Dab'a - History&quot;/&gt; Avaris was absorbed into the new city of [[Pi-Ramesses]] constructed by [[Ramesses II]] (1279–1213&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth dynasty]] when he moved the capital back to the Delta.

==Minoan connection==
{{Further information|Minoan frescoes from Tell el-Daba}}
[[File:Minoan fresko avaris 2.png|thumb|300px|Fragment of a Minoan fresco found in Avaris, Egypt. This fresco is very similar to [[:Image:Knossos frise taureau.JPG|another fresco]] from [[Knossos]], [[Crete]].]]

Avaris, along with [[Tel Kabri]] in Israel and [[Alalakh]] in Syria, also has a record of [[Minoan civilization]], which is otherwise quite rare in the Levant. [[Manfred Bietak]], an Austrian archaeologist and the excavator of Tell Dab'a, has speculated that there was close contact with the rulers of Avaris, and that the large building representing the frescoes allowed the Minoans to have a ritual life in Egypt. French archaeologist Yves Duhoux proposed the existence of a Minoan 'colony' on an island in the Nile delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duhoux |first=Yves |title=Des minoens en Egypte? &quot;Keftiou&quot; et &quot;les îles au milieu du Grand vert&quot; |year=2003 |publisher=Univ.

'''Tora''' ({{lang-arz|طرة}} ''{{transl|arz|Tora}}'' &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-arz|ˈtˤoɾˤɑ|IPA}}) was a site in [[ancient Egypt]], located about halfway between modern [[Cairo]] and [[Helwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicholas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p. 111. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It was Egypt's primary [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarry]] for [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicholas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p. 27. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Tora was known to the ancient Egyptians as ''Troyu'' or ''Royu''. This name was misinterpreted by [[Strabo]] to mean that it was inhabited by [[Troy|Trojans]], thus the [[Hellenistic]] city was named Troia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quarries&quot;/&gt; This site was located at {{coord|29|51|10|N|31|20|45|E}}, and its site is occupied by the modern town of ''Tora'' in the [[Cairo Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, Richard. ''Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World.'' p. 74. ({{ISBN|0-691-03169-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient mining town==

The limestone from Tura was the finest and whitest of all the Egyptian quarries, so it was used for facing stones for the richest tombs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saqqara.nl/context/glossary/tura Tura] Accessed 2009-06-16&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for the floors and ceilings of [[mastaba]]s which were otherwise made of mudbrick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xoomer.alice.it/francescoraf/hesyra/helwan.htm Helwan] Accessed July 28&lt;/ref&gt; It was used during the [[Old Kingdom]] and was the source of the limestone used for the &quot;Rhomboidal Pyramid&quot; or [[Bent Pyramid]] of [[Sneferu]],&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicholas.

Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and certain temples of the New Kingdom built by at least [[Ahmose I]], who may have used Tura limestone to begin the temple of [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and the Southern Harem of Amun at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicholas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p. 200. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tura limestone was deep underground and instead of [[open-pit mining]], the miners tunneled deep underground to cut large stones out, leaving some limestone behind to support the caverns left behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quarries&quot;&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/helwan/quarries-of-masara-and-tura-egy-cai-quar.htm Quarries of Masara and Tura] Accessed July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The caves were adapted by British forces during World War II to store ammunition, aircraft bombs, and other explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. I, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tunnels were surveyed in 1941, and in quarry 35, workmen found many loose [[Paper quire|quire]]s from books by [[Origen]] and [[Didymus the Blind]], two [[Alexandria]]n [[Church Fathers]]. The workers who found them stole them, and although some were seized by the authorities, most are still missing, and turn up on the antiquities market from time to time. It is believed that some of the original books could have been up to 480 pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/manuscripts/tura_papyri.htm The Tury Discovery of Manuscripts] Accessed July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ValleyMummiesRear.jpg|thumb|265x265px|Rear and side wall of the tomb Nr. 54, Valley of the Golden Mummies, el-Bahriya, Libyan desert, Egypt.]]
The '''Valley of the Golden Mummies''' is a huge burial site at [[Bahariya Oasis]] in the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] of [[Egypt]], dating to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] period. Discovered in 1996 by [[Zahi Hawass]] and his Egyptian team, approximately two hundred fifty [[mummies]] approximately two thousand years old were recovered over the period of several seasons. Eventually, the excavator further estimated a total of more than ten thousand mummies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/historicalessays/golden.htm The Discovery of the Valley of the Mummies] by Zahi Hawass.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Many of the mummies were still in good condition when they were discovered by Hawass and his team. They were decorated with many different styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tessa|title=The Valley of the Golden Mummies by Dr Zahi Hawass|url=http://egyptiansociety.co.za/2010/10/703/|website=The Egyptian Society of South Africa|publisher=Society Articles|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were four general styles of the mummies at Bahariya. The first style, which was found on approximately sixty mummies, has a gilded mask covering the face and a gilded waistcoat depicting different scenes of gods and goddesses across the chest. The second style is covered with [[cartonnage]], depicting scenes of gods such as Anubis, the god of mummification, and his four children. The third style was not decorated with gold or cartonnage, but rather was placed inside an anthropoid, a pottery coffin. The fourth style was covered in linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Discovery of  The Valley  of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya Oasis - The Plateau - Official Website of Dr. Zahi Hawass|url = http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Valley_of_the_Golden_Mummies.htm|website = www.guardians.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ValleyMummiesMummy2.jpg|thumb|Mummy found in the Valley of the Golden Mummies, now in el-Bawiti museum, el-Bahriya, Libyan desert, Egypt.|267x267px]]Artifacts had been buried with each mummy. Some examples include jewelry bracelets, pottery of food trays, wine jars, and Ptolemaic coins. The mummies found in the tombs in the Bahariya Oasis during the [[Roman period]] show that people during this period were wealthy because they were able to afford gilding and cartonnage depicting beautiful scenes. Each mummy is different with the various styles and artifacts representing each individual. Dr. Zahi Hawass notes &quot;it would seem that workshops were everywhere and artisans were one of the main professions in Baharyia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Discovery of  The Valley  of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya Oasis - The Plateau - Official Website of Dr. Zahi Hawass|url = http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Valley_of_the_Golden_Mummies.htm|website = www.guardians.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; during this time. The population in Egypt during the Roman period was about 7 million. Therefore, Dr. Hawass believed that approximately 30,000 people inhabited Baharyia. The production of wine from dates and grapes was the main industry in Bahariya, contributing to the wealth of its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Discovery of  The Valley  of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya Oasis - The Plateau - Official Website of Dr. Zahi Hawass|url = http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Valley_of_the_Golden_Mummies.htm|website = www.guardians.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mummification==
[[Mummification in Ancient Egypt|Mummification]] during the period peaked. Dr. Hawass states that the “important point about mummification is that they started to put sticks made of reeds on the right and left side of the mummy to cover the mummy with linen. This method made the mummy very stable and can last longer than the mummies of the Pharaonic period”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Discovery of  The Valley  of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya Oasis - The Plateau - Official Website of Dr. Zahi Hawass|url = http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Valley_of_the_Golden_Mummies.htm|website = www.guardians.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation of the mummies began in a workshop called the “Wabt”. The god Anubis was supposed to watch the entire process. According to Egyptian religious beliefs, the hearts of those who are deceased were placed on a scale. The feather of the goddess of truth, &quot;Maat&quot; was placed on the other side of the scale opposite of the heart. If the feather and heart did not balance each other on the scale, there would be a huge animal waiting to eat the deceased. If the scale was balanced, the god Horus would take the deceased to meet the god Osiris and goddess Isis. Those who had passed away will enjoy the life in the land or field of paradise of the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Discovery of  The Valley  of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya Oasis - The Plateau - Official Website of Dr. Zahi Hawass|url = http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Valley_of_the_Golden_Mummies.htm|website = www.guardians.net|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kellia.jpg|thumbnail|Kellia]]
'''Kellia''' (&quot;the Cells&quot;), referred to as &quot;the innermost desert&quot;, was a 4th-century Egyptian Christian [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] community spread out over many square kilometers in the [[Nitrian Desert]]. It was one of three centers of monastic activity in the region, along with [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]] and [[Scetis]] (Wadi El Natrun). It is called '''al-Muna''' in [[Arabic]] and was inhabited until the 9th century. Only archaeological sites remain there today.

==History==

Founded in 338 C.E. by [[Saint Amun]], under the spiritual guidance of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]], it was designed for those who wished to enter the [[cenobitic]] life in a semi-anchoritic monastery. An account of its founding, perhaps legendary, is in the ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]''.&lt;ref name=harmless&gt;William Harmless. ''Desert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism'', Oxford University Press, Jun 17, 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zn2ml4g79WcC&amp;pg=PA281 pg. 281]&lt;/ref&gt; Amun, who was then a monk at [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], one day talked with Anthony saying that he and some brothers wanted to move away &quot;that they may live in peace&quot;.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; Nitrea had become too successful and they wished for the solitude of the early days.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; Anthony and Amun ate dinner then walked into the desert until sunset, prayed and planted a cross to mark the site of the new community.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; The distance was 12 miles, or what Anthony considered close enough to reach in an after-dinner stroll.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt;

Kellia was for advanced monks, for those who &quot;lived a more remote life, stripped down to bare rudiments,&quot; as was recorded in the Greek ''[[Historia Monachorum in Aegypto]]'' by [[Rufinus (consul)|Flavius Rufinus]] who personally saw it.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; The cells were arranged far enough apart that &quot;no one can catch sight of another nor can a voice be heard&quot;.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; It was only for monks who had first mastered the art of desert living at Nitria.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; They came together on Saturday and Sunday to share a meal together, some journeying 3 or 4 miles from their cell to the church. &quot;They met in Church and, glimpsing this way and that, see one another as the heaven-restored.&quot;&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; If a monk failed to appear they would know he was sick or died and eventually someone (individually) would bring food or help or collect the remains. 

It was believed in the 390s up to 600 monks were at Kellia.&lt;ref name=harmless/&gt; By the 5th and 6th centuries it numbered in the thousands.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Activity began to taper off in the 7th and 8th centuries due to doctrinal disputes in Egypt, and raids from nomads out of the Libyan desert to the west.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; The site was abandoned in the 9th century.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt;

Kellia was discovered by [[archaeologist]] [[Antoine Guillaumont]] in 1964, and has been excavated for over 25 years by [[France|French]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] teams.&lt;ref name=bagnall&gt;Roger S. Bagnall, etc. ''Egypt from Alexander to the early Christians: An Archaeological and Historical Guide'', Getty Publications, 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ig4uQC20_IC&amp;pg=PA108 pg. 108-112]&lt;/ref&gt; The site covers over 125 square kilometers, over which many small hills, or ''koms'', were found.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Once excavated they were found to contain many churches and living quarters, or cells named ''koms''.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Over 1500 structures have been identified but it is probable there were many more.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; The structures range from single-cells for one person, to multiple cells for two or three people, to larger hermitages that included rooms for older monks, chapels and towers.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; In addition there were clusters of buildings that formed centers for communal services (Qasr Waheida), a complex of churches (Qasr Lsa 1), and a commercial center (Qasr al-lzeila).&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Buildings were made with a sandy mud brick and brick vaulted roofs.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Most of the recovered artifacts are pottery, some of the walls are covered in inscriptions, graffiti and paintings.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt;

'''Bubastis''' ([[Copts|Bohairic Coptic]]: {{lang|cop|Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ}} ''Poubasti''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Βούβαστις}} ''Boubastis''&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus|Herod.]] ii. 59, 137&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|grc|Βούβαστος}} ''Boubastos''&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] xvii. p. 805, [[Diodorus]] xvi. 51, [[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] v. 9. s. 9, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] iv. 5. § 52.&lt;/ref&gt;), also known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as '''Tell-Basta''' or in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as '''Per-Bast''', was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city. Bubastis is often identified with the [[Bible|biblical]] ''Pi-Beseth'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פי-בסת ''py-bst'', [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 30:17).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezekial|Ezek.]] 30:17. בחורי און ופי-בסת, בחרב יפלו; והןה, בשבי תלכןה. &quot;Youths of Awen and Pi-Beset will fall by the sword; and they (fem) will go into captivity.&quot; הןה &quot;they (feminine)&quot; cannot refer to the youths, and so must refer to the cities. Hebrew words meaning &quot;city&quot; are generally feminine (עיר, קריה).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the capital of its own [[nome (Egypt)|nome]], located along the [[Nile|River Nile]] in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], and notable as a center of worship for the feline goddess [[Bastet|Bast]], and therefore the principal depository in Egypt of mummies of cats. 

Its [[ruins]] are located in the suburbs of the modern city of [[Zagazig]]. 

==Etymology==
The name of Bubastis in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] is ''Pr-Bȝśt.t'', typically transcribed ''Per-Bast''. ''PR'' means &quot;house&quot; and the second word is the name of the goddess Bast or [[Bastet]]. The phrase means &quot;House of Bast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed I. Bakr, Helmut Brandl, &quot;Bubastis and the Temple of Bastet&quot;, in: M.I. Bakr, H. Brandl, F. Kalloniatis (eds.), ''Egyptian Antiquities from Kufur Nigm and Bubastis''. [http://www.project-min.de/index_en.html Museums in the Nile Delta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108165925/http://www.project-min.de/index_en.html |date=January 8, 2015 }} (M.i.N.) vol. 1, Cairo/ Berlin 2010, pp. 27-36, {{ISBN|978-3-00-033509-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bohairic Coptic, the name is rendered {{lang|cop|Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ}}, {{lang|cop|Ⲡⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ}} or {{lang|cop|Ⲃⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ}}.

==History==
[[File:Hathor capital on display at the Nicholson Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Hathor]] capital from the Temple of Bubastis on display at the [[Nicholson Museum]]]]
Bubastis served as the capital of the ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]'' of ''Am-Khent'', the [[Am-Khent|Bubastite nome]], the 18th nome of [[Lower Egypt]]. Bubastis was situated southwest of [[Tanis]], upon the eastern side of the [[Pelusiac branch]] of the Nile. The ''nome'' and city of Bubastis were allotted to the Calasirian division of the Egyptian war-caste.

It became a royal residence after [[Shoshenq I]], the first ruler and founder of the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd dynasty]], became [[pharaoh]] in 943 BC. Bubastis was its height during this dynasty and the [[Twenty-third dynasty of Egypt|23rd]]. It declined after the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] conquest by [[Cambyses II]] in 525 BC, which heralded the end of the Saite [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]] and the start of the [[Achaemenid dynasty]].

The Twenty Second Dynasty of Egyptian monarchs consisted of nine, or, according to [[Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of three Bubastite kings, and during their reigns the city was one of the most considerable places in the Delta. Immediately to the south of Bubastis were the allotments of land with which [[Psamtik I|Psammetichus]] rewarded the services of his [[Ionians|Ionian]] and [[Carian]] mercenaries;&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ii. 154&lt;/ref&gt; and on the northern side of the city commenced the canal which Pharaoh [[Necho II]] began (but never finished) to go between the Nile and the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losttrails.com/pages/Tales/Inquiries/Herodotus_13.html Herod. ii. 158]&lt;/ref&gt; After Bubastis was taken by the Persians, its walls were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xvi. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period it gradually declined, although it appears in ecclesiastical annals among the [[episcopal see]]s of the province [[Augustamnica|Augustamnica Secunda]]. Bubastite coins of the age of [[Hadrian]] exist.

The following is the description which [[Herodotus]] gives of Bubastis, as it appeared shortly after the period of the Persian invasion, 525 BC, and Hamilton remarks that the plan of the ruins remarkably warrants the accuracy of this historical eye-witness.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ii. 59, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Temples there are more spacious and costlier than that of Bubastis, but none so pleasant to behold. It is after the following fashion. Except at the entrance, it is surrounded by water: for two canals branch off from the river, and run as far as the entrance to the temple: yet neither canal mingles with the other, but one runs on this side, and the other on that. Each canal is a hundred feet wide, and its banks are lined with trees. The propylaea are sixty feet in height, and are adorned with sculptures (probably intaglios in relief) nine feet high, and of excellent workmanship. The Temple being in the middle of the city is looked down upon from all sides as you walk around; and this comes from the city having been raised, whereas the temple itself has not been moved, but remains in its original place. Quite round the temple there goes a wall, adorned with sculptures. Within the inclosure is a grove of fair tall trees, planted around a large building in which is the effigy (of Bast). The form of that temple is square, each side being a stadium in length. In a line with the entrance is a road built of stone about three stadia long, leading eastwards through the public market. The road is about {{convert|400|ft|m}} broad, and is flanked by exceeding tall trees. It leads to the temple of Hermes.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religion==

From the 18th dynasty, circa 1430 BC, with an additional inscription by [[Sethos I]] (circa 1290 BC). Originally from Bubastis, [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=177365&amp;partId=1&amp;place=35541&amp;plaA=35541-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bubastis was a center of worship for the feline goddess [[Bastet (goddess)|Bast]] (also called ''Bastet'' (emphasising the feminine ending ''t''), or even ''Bubastis'' (after the city)), which the [[ancient Greeks]] identified with [[Artemis]]. The [[cat]] was the [[Cats in Ancient Egypt|sacred]] and peculiar animal of Bast, who is represented with the head of a cat or a [[lion]]ess and frequently accompanies the deity [[Ptah]] in monumental inscriptions. The tombs at Bubastis were accordingly the principal depository in Egypt of the [[Animal_mummy#Cats|mummies of the cat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Elaine A.|title=Cat Mummies|url=https://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/2001/05/01/cat-mummies/|website=McClung Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture|publisher=McClung Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Nora E.|title=The Cat of Bastet|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258805.pdf.bannered.pdf|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most distinguished features of the city and nome of Bubastis were its oracle of Bast, the splendid temple of that goddess and the annual procession in honor of her. The oracle gained in popularity and importance after the influx of Greek settlers into the Delta, since the identification of Bast with Artemis attracted to her shrine both native Egyptians and foreigners.

The festival of Bubastis was the most joyous and gorgeous of all in the Egyptian calendar as described by [[Herodotus]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Barges and river craft of every description, filled with men and women, floated leisurely down the Nile. The men played on pipes of lotus. the women on cymbals and tambourines, and such as had no instruments accompanied the music with clapping of hands and dances, and other joyous gestures. Thus did they while on the river: but when they came to a town on its banks, the barges were made fast, and the pilgrims disembarked, and the women sang, playfully mocked the women of that town and threw their clothes over their head. When they reached Bubastis, then held they a wondrously solemn feast: and more wine of the grape was drank in those days than in all the rest of the year. Such was the manner of this festival: and, it is said, that as many as seven hundred thousand pilgrims have been known to celebrate the Feast of Bast at the same time.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG |title=Bubastis |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=bubastis-geo |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Christian bishopric==
Extant documents mention the names of three Christian bishops of Bubastis of the 4th and 5th centuries:
* Harpocration, one of the bishops ordained by Meletius of Lycopolis listed in 325
* Hermon, a contemporary of Saint [[Athanasius]], in about 362
* Iulianus at the [[Robber Council]] of Ephesus in 449&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;461&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 559-562&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaas A. Worp, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/8214/5_039_223.pdf?sequence=1 ''A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750)''], in ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 100 (1994) 283-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The tomb of the late [[New Kingdom]] [[vizier]] [[Iuty]] was discovered in December 1964 in the &quot;Cemetery of the Nobles&quot; of Bubastis by the Egyptian archaeologist [[Shafik Farid]].

Since 2008, the German-Egyptian &quot;Tell Basta Project&quot; has been conducting excavations at Bubastis. Previously, in March 2004, a well preserved copy of the [[Decree of Canopus]] was discovered in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ees.ac.uk/research/Tell%20Basta.html Tell Basta Project (EES/ University of Göttingen/ SCA)] Egypt Exploration Society&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cynopolis''' (Greek for &quot;city of the dog&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Room|2006|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Hellenistic]] [[Toponymy|toponym]] for two cities in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Both Cynopolis superior and Cynopolis inferior were [[bishoprics]] in Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wiltsch|1846|pp=184f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cynopolis superior ==
Cynopolis was the Greek name for the ancient Egyptian town of Hardai in the seventeenth [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Černý_631&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Černý|1975|p=631}}&lt;/ref&gt; was home to the cult of [[Anubis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Helck|1974|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; a canine-shaped [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]]. According to [[Claudius Ptolemy]], the town was situated on an island in the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lane|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern settlement of El Kays now stands on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lane|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nome of Cynopolis extended to both banks of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lane|2000|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A burial ground for dogs was discovered on the opposite bank of the Nile, near Hamatha. The neighbouring cities were rivals according to [[Plutarch]], who wrote (''De Iside'', 72) that when an Cynopolis resident ate an Oxyrhynchos fish, the people of [[Oxyrhynchos]] started attacking dogs in revenge, which resulted in a minor civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sayce|Maspero|McClure|King|1904|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cynopolis was destroyed by the viceroy of Nubia [[Pinehesy]] during the reign of [[Ramses XI]]: the survivors were enslaved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Černý_631&quot;/&gt;

The diocese, which became obscure under Islam, was nominally restored in 1933 as a Latin Catholic [[titular bishopric]]. It was named Cynopolis in Aegypto. The see has been vacant for several decades, having had the following incumbents, both of the lowest (episcopal) rank:
* Giacomo Eich, [[Salesians]] (O.S.F.S.) (1942.04.21 – 1947.02.04)
* Joseph Gerald Holland, [[Society of African Missions]] (S.M.A.) (1953.05.07 – 1970.12.07)

== Cynopolis inferior ==
There was a second Cynopolis, referred to as ''Cynopolis Inferior'' or ''Cynum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wiltsch|1846|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was located in the [[Busiris (Lower Egypt)|Busirite]] nome in [[Lower Egypt]] (the Nile delta),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bingham|2005|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Müller|1877|p=786}}&lt;/ref&gt; now modern Meniet ebn Kasib.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardouin|Pihan Delaforest|1828|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[suffragan]] bishopric of [[Oxyrhynchus]], the Metropolitan Archbishopric and provincial capital of the Late [[Roman province]] of [[Arcadia Aegypti]].

The diocese was nominally restored in 1922 as a Latin Catholic [[titular bishopric]] under the name Cynopolis. In 1933 the name of the see was changed to Cynopolis in Arcadia. The see has been vacant for several decades. The incumbents from 1922 to 1968 were:
* Robert Dobson (1922.08.22 – 1942.01.06)
* Angel Maria Ocampo Berrio, [[Jesuits]] (S.J.) (1942.06.23 – 1947.07.19) as [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Socorro y San Gil|Socorro y San Gil]] (Colombia) (1942.06.23 – 1947.07.19), succeeding as bishop (1947.07.19 – 1950.12.06), later Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tunja|Tunja]] (Colombia) (1950.12.06 – 1964.06.20), promoted first Metropolitan Archbishop of Tunja (1964.06.20 – 1970.02.20), on emeritate [[Titular Archbishop]] of [[Castulo]] (1970.02.20 – 1973.03.10)
* Joseph Zhang Run-bo (張潤波) (1947.11.20 – 1949.08.10)
* Jean-Marcel Rodié (1956.02.15 – 1968.04.10)

'''Shellal'''  ({{lang-ar|شلاّل}}) is a small ancient village on the banks of the [[Nile]], south of [[Aswan]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. It was the traditional northern frontier of the [[Nubia]]n region with both the [[Egyptian Empire]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. During the period of [[ancient Egypt]], it was a very important [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarry area]] for [[granite]] production. Nowadays it is possible to see some unfinished granite works on the site (that is soon to become an open-air museum); some of the objects on display include incomplete statues of [[Osiris]] and [[Ramesses II]] and unfinished [[Roman baths]].

Shellal was mentioned in a text dating from the 6th century AD where the king of [[Nobatia]] prides himself on having driven [[Blemmyes]] out from his country northwards from Ibrim to Shellal, on the frontier with Roman Egypt.

It was also an important city during the [[Muslim]] Arab early domination; in particular there are some ancient [[minaret]]s dating from the 11th century that are now submerged under the waters of [[Lake Nasser]]. These minarets are known to reflect the direct influence of the [[Hijaz]] region of [[Arabia]], rather that the domination of the powers of [[Lower Egypt]].

==Transport==
During the 19th century, the [[Luxor]]-[[Aswan]] railroad line was connected with a narrow-gauge line from Aswan to Shellal which had been constructed in 1884 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] as a military line during the first [[Mahdist War|Sudan Campaign]] to accelerate transport of military stores past the [[First Cataract]]. Later the final southern station in the Egyptian railroad network was converted to standard gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r050.html|title=RAILWAYS IN THE NILE VALLEY|website=mikes.railhistory.railfan.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Victoria of Baden]], Queen Victoria of [[Sweden]], visited Egypt and traveled south to Shellal where she took a now famous photograph of the site on the late afternoon of 15 February 1891. The photograph is the first known graphic document in existence, depicting the waters of the Nile at Shellal.

Today Shellal has a small port where boats depart to the near [[Philae|Philae temple]] and has a small market where the shopkeepers wait for the tourists returning from the temple.

'''Aswan''' ({{lang-ar|أسوان}}; {{lang-cop|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}}) is a city in the south of [[Egypt]], the capital of the [[Aswan Governorate]].

Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the [[Aswan Dams]] on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[first cataract]]. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of [[Elephantine]].

==Other spellings and variations==
&quot;Aswan&quot; is pronounced ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|æ|s|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|}}. Spellings in other languages include {{lang-arz|أسوان}} ''{{transl|arz|Aswān}}'' {{IPA-arz|ʔɑsˈwɑːn|}}; [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''{{transl|egy|Swenett}}''; {{lang-cop|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}} ''{{transl|cop|Souan}}''; {{lang-grc|Συήνη}} ''{{transl|grc|Syene}}''), and it was formerly spelled ''Assuan''. 

== History ==
{{Hiero | ''swnt.t'' | &lt;hiero&gt;s-E34:n-t:niwt&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=left | era=default}}

Aswan is the ancient city of '''''Swenett''''', later known as '''''Syene''''', which in antiquity was the frontier town of [[Ancient Egypt]] facing the south. Swenett is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian [[goddess]] with the same name.&lt;ref name= altas&gt;{{cite book|last = Baines|first =John|last2 = Malek|first2 =Jaromir|title = Atlas of Ancient Egypt (Cultural Atlas)|publisher = Facts On File Inc|date = March 1983|location = New York, NY|page = 240|isbn =9780871963345}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goddess later was identified as [[Eileithyia]] by the Greeks and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is &quot;the opener&quot;.  The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] symbol for &quot;trade&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muhafazat Al Gumhuriya Al Arabiya Al Mutaheda wa Asaraha al baqiah fi al asr al islamim|year=1966|author=Suʻād Māhir|publisher=Majlis al-Aʻlá lil-Shuʼūn al-Islāmīyah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEL5GwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;market&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Egypt, from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest|year=1912|author=James Henry Breasted|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptfr00inbrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the [[Ancient Egyptians]] oriented themselves toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, and as Swenett was the southernmost town in the country, [[Egypt]] always was conceived to &quot;open&quot; or begin at Swenett.&lt;ref name= altas/&gt; The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the [[Nile]], immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extend to it from [[Philae]]. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.

The [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithal shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who worked in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=on}} in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].

Swenett was equally important as a military station as a place of traffic. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, J. Harm F. [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2005/j.h.f.dijkstra/thesis.pdf ''Religious Encounters on the Southern Egyptian Frontier in Late Antiquity (AD 298-642)].&lt;!--accessed 23 June 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. p.&amp;nbsp;133, xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;797, ''seq.'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]],&lt;ref&gt;(''s. v.'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;(vii. 5. § 15, viii. 15. § 15)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. 73. s. 75, v. 10. s. 11, vi. 29. s. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitruvius]],&lt;ref&gt;(''[[De architectura]]'', book viii. ch ii. § 6)&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears on the [[Antonine Itinerary]].&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;164)&lt;/ref&gt; It also is mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 29:10, 30:6; Isaiah 49:12&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:View from the west bank to the Nile, islands, and Aswan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View from the west bank of the Nile, islands, and Aswan]]

The [[latitude]] of the city that would become Aswan – located at 24° 5′ 23″ – was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers. They believed that it was seated immediately under the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]], and that on the day of the [[summer solstice]], a vertical staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a well at noon. This statement is only approximately correct; at the summer solstice, the shadow was only {{frac|400}} of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical.
However, [[Eratosthenes]] used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at [[Alexandria]] to perform the first known calculation of the [[circumference]] of the Earth.

The [[Nile]] is nearly {{convert|650|m|mi|abbr=on}} wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.

== Climate ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}

Aswan has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]] have the hottest summer days of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are consistently above {{convert|40|°C|1}} during summer (June, July, August and also September) while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|25|°C|1}}. Summers are long, prolonged and extremely hot. Average high temperatures remain above {{convert|23|°C|1}} during the coldest month of the year while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|8|°C|1}}. Winters are short, brief and extremely warm. Wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry.

The climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than {{convert|1|mm|0|abbr=on}} of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall doesn't occur every year, as of early 2001, the last rain there was seven years earlier. Aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet, with an average relative humidity of only 26%, with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer.

The weather of Aswan is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with almost 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Aswan is one of the sunniest places on Earth.

The highest record temperature was {{convert|51|°C}} on July 4, 1918, and the lowest record temperature was {{convert|-2.4|°C}} on January 6, 1989.&lt;ref name = meteoclimat/&gt;

The '''Temple of Edfu''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]], located on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in [[Edfu]], [[Upper Egypt]]. The city was known in Greco-Roman times as Apollonopolis Magna, after the chief god [[Horus]]-[[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Rosalie. Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p.99&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple, dedicated to the falcon god [[Horus]], was built in the [[Ptolemaic period]] between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the [[Greco-Roman|Greco-Roman period]] in ancient Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts &quot;provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; There are also &quot;important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and [[Seth (mythology)|Seth]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; They are translated by the German [[Edfu-Project]].

==History==

[[File:S10.08 Edfu, image 9885.jpg|thumbnail|left| Door of the Pylon]]
Edfu was one of several temples built during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] period, including [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera]], [[Esna]], [[Temple of Kom Ombo|Kom Ombo]] and [[Philae]]. Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Agnese, Giorgio and Maurizio Re. Ancient Egypt: Art and archaeology of the land of the pharaohs, 2004. p.23 {{ISBN|0-7607-8380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present temple, which was begun &quot;on 23 August 237 BC, initially consisted of a pillared hall, two transverse halls, and a barque sanctuary surrounded by chapels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The building was started during the reign of [[Ptolemy III]] and completed in 57 BC under [[Ptolemy XII]]. It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east-west rather than north-south as in the present site. A ruined [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] lies just to the east of the current temple; inscriptional evidence has been found indicating a building program under the [[New Kingdom]] rulers [[Ramesses I]], [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]].

[[File:Edfu Temple Inside.jpg|right|thumb|Inside the Temple of Edfu.]]
A [[Naos (hieroglyph)|naos]] of [[Nectanebo II]], a relic from an earlier building, is preserved in the inner sanctuary, which stands alone while the temple's barque sanctuary is surrounded by nine chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, op. cit., p.78&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple of Edfu fell into disuse as a religious monument following [[Theodosius I]]'s edict banning non-Christian worship within the [[Roman Empire]] in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. The blackened ceiling of the [[hypostyle]] hall, visible today, is believed to be the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.

Over the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39&amp;nbsp;ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile. Local inhabitants built homes directly over the former temple grounds. Only the upper reaches of the temple pylons were visible by 1798, when the temple was identified by a French expedition. In 1860 [[Auguste Mariette]], a French [[Egyptologist]], began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.

The Temple of Edfu is nearly intact and a very good example of an ancient Egyptian temple.&lt;ref&gt;David., op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Edfu's archaeological significance and high state of preservation has made it a centre for [[tourism in Egypt]] and a frequent stop for the many [[riverboat]]s that cruise the Nile. In 2005, access to the temple was revamped with the addition of a visitor center and paved carpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardians.net/spotlite/spotlite-hawass-2005.htm|title=SPOTLIGHT INTERVIEW 2005 - Dr. Zahi Hawass|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sophisticated lighting system was added in late 2006 to allow night visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/EgyptOnline/tourism/000003/0204000000000000002517.htm|title=Night visits to Temple of Horus allowed as of New Year|accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
The temple of Edfu is the largest temple dedicated to [[Horus]] and [[Hathor]] of [[Dendera]].&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; It was the center of several festivals sacred to Horus. Each year, &quot;Hathor travelled south from her temple at [[Dendera Temple complex|Denderah]] to visit Horus at Edfu, and this event marking their sacred marriage was the occasion of a great festival and pilgrimage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David., op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on British architecture==
The Temple of Edfu provides the model for [[Temple Works]] in [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]]. The courtyard columns at Edfu are closely copied in the frontage of the Works.

:''Heracleion is also a spelling of [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]]'s largest city and capital.''

'''Heracleion''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡράκλειον}}), also known by its Egyptian name '''Thonis''' ({{lang|grc|Θῶνις}}) and sometimes called '''Thonis-Heracleion''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian city located near the [[Canopic Mouth]] of the Nile, about 32&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Alexandria]]. Its ruins are located in [[Abu Qir Bay]], currently 2.5&amp;nbsp;km off the coast, under {{convert|10|m|abbr=on|-1}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/heracleion-photos-lost-egyptian-city_n_3178208.htm|title=Heracleion Photos: Lost Egyptian City Revealed After 1,200 Years Under Sea|work=The Huffington Post|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[stele]] found on the site indicates that it was one single city known by both its Egyptian and Greek names.&lt;ref name=LostCities6&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/15/lost-cities-6-thonis-heracleion-egypt-sunken-sea|title=Lost cities #6: how Thonis-Heracleion resurfaced after 1,000 years under water|last=Shenker|first=Jack|date=15 Aug 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its legendary beginnings go back to as early as the 12th century BC, and it is mentioned by ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] historians. Its importance grew particularly during the waning days of the [[Pharaoh]]s.&lt;ref name=Alberge&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Dalya Alberge|title=Ancient Egyptian underwater treasures to be exhibited for the first time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/02/ancient-egyptian-artefacts-thonis-heracleion-canopus-paris|date=2 August 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracleion was originally built on some adjoining islands in the [[Nile Delta]]. It was intersected by canals&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; with a number of harbors and anchorages. Its wharves, temples and tower-houses were linked by ferries, bridges, and pontoons. The city was an ''emporion'' (trading port)&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; and in the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] it was the country's main port for international trade&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; and collection of taxes. It had a sister city, [[Naucratis]], which was another trading port lying 45&amp;nbsp;mi (72&amp;nbsp;km) further up the Nile. Goods were transferred inland via Naucratis, or they were transported via the Western Lake and through a water channel to the nearby town of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] for onward distribution.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

During the second century BC Alexandria superseded Heracleion as Egypt’s primary port. At the end of the century the soil on which Heracleion was built succumbed to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] and its buildings collapsed into the water.  A few residents stayed on during the Roman era and the beginning of Arab rule, but by the end of the eighth century AD what was left of the city had sunk beneath the sea.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

==Legendary beginnings==
Heracleion is mentioned by many chroniclers in antiquity, including [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]] and [[Diodorus]].&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; The city was said by Herodotus to have been visited by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Helen of Troy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford University and the rediscovery of the lost Egyptian city of Heracleion|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/11820878.Sunken_city_of_Egypt_found/|last=Little|first=Reg|date=26 February 2015|newspaper=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the Trojan war began.&lt;ref name=Goddio&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunken Civilizations|url=http://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html|website=Franck Goddio|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed {{by whom|date=January 2017}} that Paris and Helen sought refuge there&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; on their flight from the jealous [[Menelaus]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} or that Menelaus and Helen had stayed there, accommodated by the noble Egyptian Thon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stephanus of Byzantium]]|title=Ethnika kat' epitomen|url=https://archive.org/stream/stephanibyzanti00meingoog#page/n332/mode/2up|chapter=Θῶνις|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polydamna]]. The 2nd century BC Greek poet [[Nicander]] wrote that Menelaus’s helmsman, Canopus, was bitten by a viper on the sands of Thonis.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; According to Herodotus, a great temple was built at the spot where [[Heracles]] first arrived in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Goddio/&gt; The story of Heracles' visit resulted in the Greeks calling the city by the Greek name Heracleion rather than its original Egyptian name Thonis.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Ancient references==
[[Image:PtolemyVIIIStela.jpg|thumb|The stelae of Ptolemy VIII from the temple of Heracleion]]

{{quote|Until very recently the site had been known only from a few literary and epigraphic sources, one of which interestingly mentions the site as an [[Emporia (ancient Greece)|emporion]], just like Naukratis.|[[British Museum]], 2013&lt;ref name=naukratis&gt;
[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ng/naukratis_greeks_in_egypt/introduction/naukratis_a_city_and_port.aspx Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The city was mentioned by the ancient historians Diodorus (1.19.4) and Strabo (17.1.16). Herodotus was told that Thonis was the warden of the Canopic mouth of the [[Nile]]: Thonis arrested [[Paris (mythology)|Alexander]] (Paris), the son of [[Priam]], because Alexander had abducted [[Helen of Troy]] and taken much wealth.&lt;ref name=naukratis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 2.113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracleion is also mentioned in the twin [[steles]] of the [[Decree of Nectanebo I]] (the first of which is known as the 'Stele of Naukratis'), which specify that one tenth of the taxes on imports passing through the town of Thonis/Herakleion were to be given to the sanctuary of [[Neith]] of [[Sais]].&lt;ref name=naukratis /&gt; The city is also mentioned in the [[Decree of Canopus]] honoring Pharaoh [[Ptolemy III]], which describes donations, sacrifices and a procession on water.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt;

Sanctuaries in Heracleion dedicated to Osiris and other gods were famous for miraculous healing and attracted pilgrims from a wide area.&lt;ref name=Alberge/&gt; The city was the site of the celebration of the ‘mysteries of [[Osiris]]' each year during the month of Khoiak. The god in his ceremonial boat was brought in procession from the temple of Amun in that city to his shrine in [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Archaeology==
[[Image:PtolemyWithElephants.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] coins from the submerged Heracleion]]
The city had a large temple of [[Khonsu|Khonsou]], son of [[Amun]], who was known to the Greeks as [[Herakles]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Burton, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary.''] BRILL, 1972 {{ISBN|9004035141}} p105&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the worship of Amun became more prominent.

Heracleion flourished especially from the 6th to the 4th century BC, as revealed by numerous archaeological finds. Pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]] made many additions to the temple in the 4th century B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost city of Heracleion gives up its secrets&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/archaeology/10022628/Lost-city-of-Heracleion-gives-up-its-secrets.html |title=Lost city of Heracleion gives up its secrets |work=The Telegraph |accessdate = 2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the city was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and  rising sea levels. Finds of pottery and coins appear to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. At this point, probably after a severe flood, the central island succumbed to liquefaction of the soil on which it was built. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

In 1933 an [[RAF]] commander flying over Abu Qir Bay saw ruins under the water. At that time, most historians believed that Thonis and Heracleion were two separate cities, both located on what is now the Egyptian mainland.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt; The ruins submerged in the sea were located by the French [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologist]] [[Franck Goddio]] in 1999. Goddio's finds have included incomplete statues of the god [[Serapis]] and the queen [[Arsinoe II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph-Goddio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sooke|first1=Alastair|title=Sunken Cities: the man who found Atlantis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/sunken-cities-the-man-who-found-atlantis/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No more than 5% of the city's area was explored by the archaeologist.&lt;ref name=LostCities6/&gt;

'''Oxyrhynchus''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|ŋ|k|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ὀξύρρυγχος}} ''Oxýrrhynkhos''; &quot;sharp-nosed&quot;; ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''Pr-Medjed''; [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Pemdje''; modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] ''El Bahnasa'') is a city in [[Middle Egypt]], located about 160&amp;nbsp;km south-southwest of [[Cairo]], in the governorate of [[Al Minya Governorate|Al Minya]]. It is also an [[archaeological site]], considered one of the most important ever discovered. For the past century, the area around Oxyrhynchus has been continually excavated, yielding an enormous collection of [[papyrus]] texts dating from the time of the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman]] periods of [[History of Egypt|Egyptian history]]. Among the texts discovered at Oxyrhynchus are plays of [[Menander]], fragments from the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]],'' and fragments from [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].  They also include a few [[vellum]] manuscripts, and more recent [[Arabic language|Arabic]] manuscripts on [[paper]] (for example, the medieval P. Oxy. VI 1006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about---00031-001-1-0utf-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=POxy&amp;cl=CL2.1&amp;d=HASH673b681e54e504ce92ae08|title=Oxyrhynchus Online Image Database|publisher=Oxyrhynchus Online Project Metadata|access-date=27 March 2017}} Document Location: The Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt.

==History==
[[File:Oxyrhynchus Citizen statue.jpg|thumb|left|A citizen of Oxyrhynchus. Limestone statue from Egypt circa 300 to 200 BC, on display in the National Museum of Scotland.]]
Oxyrhynchus lies west of the main course of the [[Nile]], on the [[Bahr Yussef]] (Canal of Joseph), a branch of the [[Nile]] that terminates in [[Lake Moeris]] and the [[Fayum]] [[oasis]]. In [[ancient Egypt]]ian times, there was a city on the site called '''[[Pr (hieroglyph)|Per]]-Medjed''',&lt;ref name=&quot;where&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/oxyrhynchus/whereis.html|title=Where is Oxyrhynchus?|publisher=Oxyrhynchus Online|date=|accessdate=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the [[medjed (fish)|medjed]], a species of [[Mormyridae|elephantfish]] of the [[Nile River]] worshipped there as the fish that ate the penis of [[Osiris]]. It was the capital of the 19th [[Upper Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]]. After the conquest of [[Egypt]] by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, the city was reestablished as a [[Greece|Greek]] town, called '''Oxyrrhynkhoupolis''' (Οξυρρύγχου Πόλις - &quot;town of the [[Sturgeon|sharp-snouted fish]]&quot;).

In [[Hellenistic]] times, Oxyrhynchus was a prosperous regional capital, the third-largest city in [[Egypt]]. After Egypt was [[Christianization|Christianized]], it became famous for its many [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[monastery|monasteries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;where&quot; /&gt;

In the period from 619 to 629, when Egypt was ruled by the Persian [[Sasanian|Sassanids]], three Greek papyri from Oxyrhynchus include references to large sums of gold that were to be sent to the Sasanian &quot;king of kings&quot; ([[Shahanshah]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | article = EGYPT iv.

Oxyrhynchus remained a prominent, though gradually declining, town in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Arab invasion of Egypt around 641]], the canal system on which the town depended fell into disrepair, and Oxyrhynchus was abandoned.&lt;!--Parsons says it was still important in 942--&gt; Today the town of '''El Bahnasa''' occupies part of the ancient site.

For more than 1,000 years, the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus dumped garbage at a series of sites out in the desert sands beyond the town limits. The fact that the town was built on a canal rather than on the Nile itself was important, because this meant that the area did not flood every year with the rising of the river, as did the districts along the riverbank. When the canals dried up, the water table fell and never rose again. The area west of the Nile has virtually no rain, so the garbage dumps of Oxyrhynchus were gradually covered with sand and were forgotten for another 1,000 years.

Because Egyptian society under the Greeks and Romans was governed bureaucratically, and because Oxyrhynchus was the capital of the 19th [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]], the material at the Oxyrhynchus dumps included vast amounts of papyri. Accounts, tax returns, census material, invoices, receipts, correspondence on administrative, military, religious, economic, and political matters, certificates and licenses of all kinds&amp;mdash;all these were periodically cleaned out of government offices, put in wicker baskets, and dumped out in the desert. Private citizens added their own piles of unwanted papyri. Because papyrus was expensive, papyri were often reused: a document might have farm accounts on one side, and a student's text of [[Homer]] on the other. The ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]],'' therefore, contained a complete record of the life of the town, and of the [[civilization]]s and [[empire]]s of which the town was a part.

The town site of Oxyrhynchus itself has never been excavated, because the modern Egyptian town is built on top of it, but it is believed that the city had many public buildings, including a theatre with a capacity of 11,000 spectators, a [[hippodrome]], four public baths, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], and two small ports on the Bahr Yussef. It is also likely that there were military buildings, such as [[barracks]], since the city supported a military garrison on several occasions during the Roman and Byzantine periods. During the Greek and Roman periods, Oxyrhynchus had temples to [[Serapis]], [[Zeus]]-[[Amun]], [[Hera]]-[[Isis]], [[Atargatis]]-[[Bethnnis]] and [[Osiris]]. There were also [[Greek temple]]s to [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Apollo]]; as well as [[Roman temple]]s to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter Capitolinus]] and [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. In the Christian era, Oxyrhynchus was the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]], and the modern town still has several ancient [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] churches.

When [[Flinders Petrie]] visited Oxyrhynchus in 1922, he found remains of the colonnades and theatre. Now only part of a single column remains: everything else has been scavenged for building material for modern housing.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Peter (2007).

==Excavation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ac.bernardgrenfell.jpg|thumb|right|Bernard Grenfell]] --&gt;
{{main|Oxyrhynchus Papyri}}
In 1882, Egypt, while still nominally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], came under effective British rule, and British archaeologists began the systematic exploration of the country. Because Oxyrhynchus was not considered an Ancient Egyptian site of any importance, it was neglected until 1896, when two young excavators, [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell|Bernard Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Hunt]], both [[fellow]]s of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], began to excavate it. &quot;My first impressions on examining the site were not very favourable,&quot; wrote Grenfell. &quot;The rubbish mounds were nothing but rubbish mounds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in A.M. Luijendijk, &quot;Sacred Scriptures as Trash: Biblical Papyri from Oxyrhynchus&quot; ''Vigiliae Christianae'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they very soon realized what they had found. The unique combination of climate and circumstance had left at Oxyrhynchus an unequalled archive of the ancient world. &quot;The flow of papyri soon became a torrent,&quot; Grenfell recalled. &quot;Merely turning up the soil with one's boot would frequently disclose a layer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grenfell |first1=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Pyne Grenfell |editor-last=Griffith |editor-first=F.L. |publisher=Egypt Exploration Fund. |date=1898 |title=Archaeological Report: 1896-1897 |pages=1-12, (7) |chapter=Oxyrhynchus and Its Papyri |access-date=October 1, 2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k406AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Merely+turning+up+the+soil+with+one%27s+boot+would+frequently+disclose+a+layer%22&amp;q=%22Merely+turning+up+the+soil+with+one%27s+boot+would+frequently+disclose+a+layer%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Merely%20turning%20up%20the%20soil%20with%20one's%20boot%20would%20frequently%20disclose%20a%20layer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being classically educated Englishmen, Grenfell and Hunt were mainly interested in the possibility that Oxyrhynchus might reveal the lost masterpieces of classical Greek literature. They knew, for example, that the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'' by [[Aristotle]] had been discovered on Egyptian papyrus in 1890. This hope inspired them and their successors to sift through the mountains of rubbish at Oxyrhynchus for the next century. Their efforts were amply rewarded: it has been estimated that over 70% of all the literary papyri so far discovered come from Oxyrhynchus, both copies of well-known standard works (many in versions significantly closer to the originals than those that had been transmitted in medieval manuscripts) and previously unknown works by the greatest authors of antiquity.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:ac.arthurhunt.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Hunt|{{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

However, from the many thousands of papyri excavated from Oxyrhynchus, only about 10% were literary. The rest consisted of public and private documents: codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records, sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, and private letters. Still, Grenfell and Hunt found enough texts of more general interest to keep them going in the hope of finding more. In their first year of digging alone, they found parts of several lost plays of [[Sophocles]], such as the ''[[Ichneutae]]'' and many other books and fragments, including parts of what appeared to be an unknown Christian [[gospel]]. These discoveries captured the public imagination, and Grenfell and Hunt sent articles and photos to newspapers in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], arguing the importance of their work and seeking donations to keep it going.

Aside from the years of [[World War I]], Grenfell and Hunt devoted their lives to work on the material from Oxyrhynchus. For ten years, from 1896 to 1906, every winter, when the Egyptian climate was bearable, Grenfell and Hunt supervised hundreds of Egyptian workers, excavating the rubbish mounds, digging up tightly packed layers of papyrus mixed with earth. The finds were sifted, partially cleaned and then shipped to Grenfell and Hunt's base at [[Oxford]]. During the summer, Grenfell and Hunt cleaned, sorted, translated and compared the year's haul, assembling complete texts from dozens of fragments and extracts. In 1898, they published the first volume of their finds. They worked closely together, each revising what the other wrote, and publishing the result jointly. In 1926, however, Grenfell died, leaving Hunt to continue the work with other collaborators until his own death in 1934. Meanwhile, Italian excavators had returned to the site: their work, from 1910 to 1934, brought to light many further papyri, including additional pieces of papyrus rolls of which parts had already been discovered by Grenfell and Hunt.

==Finds==
Although the hope of finding all the lost literary works of antiquity at Oxyrhynchus was not realized, many important Greek texts were found at the site. These include poems of [[Pindar]], fragments of [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], along with larger pieces of [[Alcman]], [[Ibycus]], and [[Corinna]].

There were also extensive remains of the ''Hypsipyle'' of [[Euripides]], fragments of the comedies of [[Menander]], and a large part of the ''[[Ichneutae]]'' of [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles' ''Ichneutae'' was adapted, in 1988, into a play entitled ''[[The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus]]'', by British poet and author [[Tony Harrison]], featuring Grenfell and Hunt as main characters.&lt;/ref&gt; Also found were the oldest and most complete diagrams from [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Another important find was the historical work known as the ''[[Hellenica Oxyrhynchia]]'', whose author is unknown but may be [[Ephorus]] or, as many currently think, [[Cratippus of Athens|Cratippus]]. A life of [[Euripides]] by [[Satyrus the Peripatetic]] was also unearthed, while an ''[[epitome]]'' of seven of the 107 lost books of [[Livy]] was the most important literary find in [[Latin language|Latin]].

The classical author who has most benefited from the finds at Oxyrhynchus is the Athenian playwright Menander (342&amp;ndash;291 BC), whose comedies were very popular in Hellenistic times and whose works are frequently found in papyrus fragments. Menander's plays found in fragments at Oxyrhynchus include ''Misoumenos'', ''Dis Exapaton'', ''Epitrepontes'', ''Karchedonios'', ''[[Dyskolos]]'' and ''Kolax''. The works found at Oxyrhynchus have greatly raised Menander's status among classicists and scholars of [[Greek theatre]].

Among the Christian texts found at Oxyrhynchus, were fragments of early non-[[Biblical canon|canonical]] Gospels, ''Oxyrhynchus 840'' (3rd century AD) and ''[[Oxyrhynchus 1224]]'' (4th century AD). Other Oxyrhynchus texts preserve parts of ''[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew 1]]'' (3rd century: ''P2'' and ''P401''), 11&amp;ndash;12 and 19 (3rd to 4th century: ''P2384,'' ''2385''); ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark 10&amp;ndash;11]]'' (5th to 6th century: ''P3''); ''[[Gospel of John|John 1]],'' and 20 (3rd century: ''P208''); ''[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 1]]'' (4th century: ''P209''); the ''[[First Epistle of John]]'' (4th-5th century: ''P402''); the ''[[Apocalypse of Baruch (disambiguation)|Apocalypse of Baruch]]'' (chapters 12&amp;ndash;14; 4th or 5th century: ''P403''); the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]] (3rd century AD: ''P655''); ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'' (3rd or 4th century: ''P404''), and a work of [[Irenaeus]], (3rd century: ''P405''). There are many parts of other canonical books as well as many early Christian hymns, prayers, and letters also found among them.

Since the 1930s, work on the papyri has continued. For many years it was under the supervision of Professor [[Peter J. Parsons|Peter Parsons]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. Eighty large volumes of the ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'' have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/publications/fulllist.htm |title=Publications: Full List |publisher=Egypt Exploration Society |date= |accessdate=30 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128122817/http://www.ees.ac.uk/publications/fulllist.htm |archivedate=28 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Full List of EES Publications 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/userfiles/file/EES%20Publications%20List_Jul%202016.pdf|website=The Egypt Exploration Society|title=Publications|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;and these have become an essential reference work for the study of Egypt between the 4th century BC and the 7th century AD. They are also extremely important for the history of the [[early Christian Church]], since many Christian documents have been found at Oxyrhynchus in far earlier versions than those known elsewhere. At least another forty volumes are anticipated.

Since the days of Grenfell and Hunt, the focus of attention at Oxyrhynchus has shifted. Modern archaeologists are less interested in finding the lost plays of [[Aeschylus]], although some still dig in hope, and more in learning about the social, economic, and political life of the ancient world. This shift in emphasis had made Oxyrhynchus, if anything, even more important, for the very ordinariness of most of its preserved documents makes them most valuable for modern scholars of social history. Many works on Egyptian and Roman social and economic history and on the history of Christianity rely heavily on documents from Oxyrhynchus.

In 1966, the publication of the papyri was formally adopted as a Major Research Project of the [[British Academy]], jointly managed by [[Oxford University]] and [[University College London]] and headed by Parsons. The project's chief researcher and administrator is Dr [[Nikolaos Gonis]]. The Academy provided funding until 1999; the project then enjoyed a grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]], which funded ongoing work until 2005. Today some 100,000 papyrus fragments are housed at the [[Sackler Library]], Oxford, with their indexes, archives and photographic record; it is the biggest hoard of classical manuscripts in the world. About 2,000 items are mounted in glass &amp;mdash; the rest are conserved in 800 boxes.

The focus of the project is now mainly on the publication of this vast archive of material: by 2003 4,700 items had been translated, edited and published. Publication continues at the rate of about one new volume each year. Each volume contains a selection of material, covering a wide range of subjects. The editors include senior professionals but also students studying [[papyrology]] at the doctoral or undergraduate level. Thus recent volumes offer early fragments of the ''[[Gospels]]'' and of the ''[[Book of Revelation]],'' early witnesses to the texts of [[Apollonius Rhodius]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Demosthenes]], and [[Euripides]], previously unknown texts of [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and [[Menander]] and of the [[epigram]]matist [[Nicarchus]]. Other subjects covered include specimens of [[Greek music]] and documents relating to [[Magical thinking|magic]] and [[astrology]].

A joint project with [[Brigham Young University]] using [[Multi-spectral image|multi-spectral imaging]] technology has been extremely successful in recovering previously illegible writing. With [[Multi-spectral image|multi-spectral imaging]], many pictures of the illegible papyrus are taken using different filters, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, researchers can find the optimum spectral portion for distinguishing ink from paper in order to display otherwise completely illegible papyri. The amount of text potentially to be deciphered by this technique is huge. A selection of the images obtained during the project and more information on the latest discoveries has been provided on the project's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/multi/index.html|title=Multispectral imaging|publisher=Oxyrhynchos online|date=|accessdate=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2005 the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' published the text and translation of a newly reconstructed poem by [[Sappho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25345-1886660,00.html |title=A New Sappho Poem |author=Martin West |publisher=Times Online |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628085129/http://www.tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C25345-1886660%2C00.html |archivedate=28 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with discussion by [[Martin L.

In 1992, upon the discovery of an important necropolis from the Saite period ranging from the Christian era (664 BC -.. 640 AD) a joint action by the University of Barcelona and the Egyptian Antiquities Service began with the aim of initiating a research program: The Archaeological Mission Oxyrhynchus. In 2004 the first program agreement was signed to enhance the Mission between the University of Barcelona, the current driver of the mission together with the Department of Culture and Media of the Generalitat of Catalonia, but since 2011 it is only financed by the University of Barcelona, the Spanish Ministry and the Catalan Society of Egyptology.
The aim of the mission is to give continuity to the historical archaeological studies of previous expeditions while promoting research at Oxyrhynchus and conserve and enhance structures discovered on the site. In addition to the publication of several articles in professional journals, excavations carried out by the Mission have resulted in a sample, presented at the Egyptian Museum and the Greco-Roman Museum in Alexandria with paintings of late antiquity and various objects belonging to a necropolis Osireion located 1.5&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the urban area; and various publications of the Catalan Institute of Classical Archaeology.

[[Image:AmenemhetIPyramid.jpg|thumb|250px|The ruined pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lisht.]]
'''Lisht''' or '''el-Lisht''' is an [[Egypt]]ian village located south of [[Cairo]]. It is the site of [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] royal and elite burials, including two [[pyramid]]s built by [[Amenemhat I]] and [[Senusret I]]. The two main pyramids were surrounded by smaller pyramids of members of the royal family, and many [[mastaba]] tombs of high officials and their family members. They were constructed throughout the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] and [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth]] Dynasties. The site is also known for the tomb of [[Senebtisi]], found undisturbed and from which a set of jewelry has been recovered. The pyramid complex of Senusret I is the best preserved from this period. The coffins in the tomb of [[Sesenebnef]] present the earliest versions of the [[Book of the Dead]].

===Introduction===

The ancient Egyptian site of el-Lisht can be found on the west bank of the Nile River, around 65&amp;nbsp;km south of the city of Cairo. It is a Twelfth Dynasty necropolis, close to the city of Itj-Tawy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah15146 | title=El-Lisht | journal=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History | last1 = Willoughby | first1 = Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eleventh Dynasty’s capital was located at the city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].  The first king of the [[Twelfth Dynasty]], [[Amenemhet I]], moved the capital from Thebes to a city near el-Lisht called [[Itj-tawy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=172 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was close to the mouth of the [[Fayyum]], and well situated to control the 'Two Lands' of Upper and Lower Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Toby |authorlink=Toby Wilkinson |date=2010 |page=163 |title=The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another motive suggested is land reclamation and desire to increase the agricultural output for the region.  The ruins of Itj-Tawy have never been conclusively identified, and the only locational evidence discovered consists of pieces of pottery in the area it is believed to be in.  However, Twelfth Dynasty rulers built pyramids at el-Lisht which are known to researchers.

El-Lisht is the necropolis of the first two rulers of Dynasty XII, Amenemhet I and his son and successor [[Senusret I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah15146 | title=El-Lisht | journal=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History | last1 = Willoughby | first1 = Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pyramids would have been visible to those traveling to Itj-Tawy from the south. The more famous of the two monumental complexes, that of Amenemhat I, featured an offering hall with a granite altar, carved with depictions of representatives of the nomes (provinces) bringing offerings to the pharaoh. However, the pyramid itself is in a ruined state, rising approximately 20m above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amenemhet1p.htm|title=The Pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lisht in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excavations===

El-Lisht was first excavated in 1882 by the French Egyptologist [[Gaston Maspero]].  Maspero was from Paris but had an interest for the history of Egypt so went on to study under [[Auguste Mariette]].  When Mariette died Maspero took on the archeological mission.  His interest in ancient Egypt originally took him there to excavate for the French government but later he went on to found the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology.  This group further excavated the site from 1884 until 1885.  From 1906 to 1934 the Egyptian Expedition of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, continued to work on el-Lisht.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Middle_Kingdom_Tomb_Architecture_at_Lisht_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Egyptian_Expedition|title=Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Egyptian Expedition {{!}} MetPublications {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this time period Egyptologists were able to excavate for fourteen seasons.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art returned to el-Lisht between 1984 and 1991.

===North Side of el-Lisht- Pyramid of Amenemhet I===
The pyramid of Amenemhet I was about 55 meters tall when originally built but because of poor construction, quarrying and tomb robberies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/Middle_Kingdom_Tomb_Architecture_at_Lisht_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Egyptian_Expedition|title=Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Egyptian Expedition {{!}} MetPublications {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it now stands at approximately 20m in height.  Apart from poor construction, the material used to build the pyramid was not durable.  Studies show it was made from unfired mudbrick and stones from other monuments.  The mudbrick, sand and debris would have been the material of choice since each was readily available, and mudbrick proved cheap since the city was so close to the Fayyum. Specifically, stones from the monuments of [[Khufu]], [[Khafre]], [[Unas]] and Pepy have been found at Amenemhat's funerary complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amenemhet1p.htm|title=The Pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lisht in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent excavations uncovered plans for a pyramid much larger than the building actually constructed.  One theory is that the terrain of the site was unsuitable for the structure due to poor sloping topography.  Alternatively, it has been suggested that the pharaoh's health could have been declining and he did not think he would live to see it finished in time, yet did not want to be buried in an unfinished tomb. A third theory holds that Amenemhat I had already died after designing the tomb, and his son and successor rushed through his father's memorial so that he could start construction on his own.

The pyramid's true entrance is found on its north side.  From here, a hallway lined with pink granite leads to a small room at the core of the pyramid, from where a shaft connects to the burial chamber.  The chamber has been filled with Nile seepage water over the years, making new discoveries difficult.  Attempts have been made to keep water out but pumping has not worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=172 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; No full statues of Amenemhat I were unearthed during archaeological expeditions. However, a [[limestone]] statuette's head, thought to belong to an image of the pharaoh, has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=175 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South side of el-Lisht- Pyramid of Senusret I===

Senusret I built his pyramid on the southern side of el-Lisht, around a mile south of his father's funerary complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=182 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pyramid, named 'Senusret Looks Down on Both Lands' was also discovered by Gaston Maspero in 1882.  He was able to identify the owner from objects in the pyramid marked with the pharaoh's name.  The excavation team found relief blocks, fragments, and small shrines on the site that were consistent with Middle Kingdom art.  Then in 1894 the site was excavated by archeologists J.E. Gautier and G. Jequier who worked there until 1895.  From 1906 until 1943 a team from the Metropolitan Museum of Art excavated it.  Later, from 1984 to 1987, further excavation was carried out by Dieter Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/senusret1p.htm|title=The Pyramid of Senusret I at Lisht in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid of Senusret I was much larger than that of Amenemhet I.  Its base was 105 meters wide, with a height that once reached 61.25 meters tall.  Although he followed a similar plan to that of his father, architects used a new technique.  In theory this new technique was supposed to make the pyramid stronger.  The architects built outward from a core of coarse limestone blocks filled in with mudbrick and debris, then revetted the central structure with heavy blocks and surrounded it with a smooth casing of white limestone from Tureh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=182 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique continued to be used for much of the Middle Kingdom.

The unroofed causeway leading to the pyramid was punctuated with alcoves in which stood large limestone statues of Senusret I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=185 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;- some of these are now on show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and at the [[Museum of Egyptian Antiquities]] in Cairo. The causeway was also flanked by mudbrick buildings for the use of the priests who would perform rituals for the deceased monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/senusret1p.htm|title=The Pyramid of Senusret I at Lisht in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north side of the pyramid was fronted by a small chapel with an alabaster false-door [[stela]], decorated with pictures of offerings being presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes |first=William C. |authorlink=William C. Hayes |date=1953 |page=183 |title=The Scepter of Egypt- A Background for the Study of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funerary temple lay to the east, at the head of the valley causeway leading to the pyramid, and was similar in style to that of [[Pepi II]], a Sixth Dynasty pharaoh. The central passage within the pyramid led to a burial chamber containing sculpted lion heads that would sprout water out which would flow away through a drain.

While some of the inner framework of Senusret's pyramid has been preserved, the pyramid itself is almost all rubble. The burial chamber is flooded by Nile seepage water, and many of the pyramid's treasures were stolen in antiquity. According to the excavations, the tomb was robbed shortly after being sealed.  Besides the central tomb passage, another tunnel has been found, its use being to transport funerary materials to the chambers. Maspero concluded that the transporting tunnel was used by thieves to rob the pyramid, because this is where funerary goods from the king’s chambers were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/senusret1p.htm|title=The Pyramid of Senusret I at Lisht in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funerary Temples at el-Lisht===

Both Amenemhet I and Senusret I had funerary temples, but archeologists know more about Senusret because his fathers is almost completely destroyed.  The only remains of Amenemhet I funerary temple are carvings of Nile god and Nome deities.  It is thought that Senusret had Amenemhet rebuilt because his name is on the foundation of the temple remains.  Since there is more left of Senusret I's temple, it was easier to reconstruct the original architectural plan for it.  We know it was similar to those found in Dynasty VI with a courtyard, portico, and offering hall with store rooms on either side.  Years later, the tombs of wives, children and close officials began to be plotted around the temples of these kings.  It turned into a honeycomb of graves for their families and servants that multiplied with each generation.  After the fall of the dynasty, the necropolis was no longer thought to be in need of guarding so grave robbers and looters descended.

===Conclusions===

Through excavating this site, archaeologists were able to learn a few things, even if the remains were not in pristine condition. el-Lisht is notable for its commissioners' 'cannibalization' of earlier monuments, which is thought to symbolize the restoration of Egypt to its Old Kingdom glory. The change of relief carving styles in the Twelfth Dynasty is also apparent in the two pyramids at this site.

'''Berenice''' '''(Berenike)''' or '''Berenice Troglodytica''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Βερενίκη}}), also known as '''Baranis''', is an ancient seaport of [[Egypt]] on the west coast of the [[Red Sea]]. It is situated about 825&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Suez]] and 260&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Aswan]] in [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl/index.php?id=80&amp;L=0|title=Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej UW: Berenike (Egypt)|last=www.grupamak.pl|first=Grupa MAK, Warszawa,|website=www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 275 BC by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (285–246 BC), who named it after his mother, [[Berenice I of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Letter Concerning Boats in Berenike and Trade on the Red Sea.&quot; Michael Peppard. ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'', Bd. 171 (2009), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Troglodytica'' refers to the aboriginal people of the region, the &quot;[[Troglodytae|Troglodytai]]&quot; or &quot;cave dwellers&quot;. Although the name is attested by several ancient writers, the more ancient Ptolemaic inscriptions read ''Trogodytai'' (which [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] has speculated could be related to the same root as [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]). It is possible that later copyists  confused this name with the more common term ''Troglodytai''.

Built at the head of a gulf, the Sinus Immundus, or [[Foul Bay]], of [[Strabo]], it was sheltered on the north by [[Ras Benas]] (Lepte Extrema). A lofty range of mountains runs along this side of the African coast, and separates Berenice from the [[Nile Valley]]. The emerald mines of Zabara and Saket are in its neighbourhood. The harbour is indifferent, but was improved by art. Berenice stood upon a narrow rim of shore between the hills and the Red Sea. The harbor of Berenice was sheltered from the northeast wind by the island Ophiodes ({{lang|grc|Ὀφιώδης νήσος}}, [[Strabo]] xvi. p.&amp;nbsp;770; [[Diodorus|Diod.]] iii. 39), which was rich in topazes.

==History==

Berenice was quite famous and prosperous in antiquity.  The city is noted by most ancient geographers, including [[Strabo]], [[Pliny the Elder]] (vi. 23, 26, 29, 33), and [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (''s. v.'').  Its prosperity after the third century was owing in great measure to three causes: the favour of the [[Macedon]]ian kings, its safe anchorage, and its being a terminus of the great road from [[Coptos]] (now [[Qift]]) on the [[Nile]], which rendered Berenice and [[Myos Hormos]] the two principal emporia of the trade between [[Aethiopia]] and Egypt on the one hand, and [[Syria]] and [[Tamilakkam]] on the other. The road across the desert from Coptos was 258 Roman miles long, or eleven days' journey. The road was provided with watering stations (Greek ''hydreumata'', see [[Hadhramaut]]); the wells and halting places of the caravans are enumerated by Pliny (vi. 23. s. 26), and in the Itineraries ([[Antonine Itinerary|Antonin.]] p.&amp;nbsp;172, f.). Belzoni (''Travels'', vol. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;35) found traces of several of these stations.

From the 1st century BC until the 2nd century AD, Berenice was one of the trans-shipping points of trade between [[India]], [[Arabia]], and Upper Egypt. It was connected to [[Antinopolis]] on the [[River Nile]] in Lower Egypt by the [[Via Hadriana]] in 137. The trade from Berenice along the [[Red Sea]] coast is described in the 1st century AD travelogue ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', written by a Greek merchant based in [[Alexandria]]. The ''Periplus'' indicates that &quot;on the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the [[Berbers]]&quot;, thereby placing Berenice Troglodytica just north of ancient [[Barbara (region)|Barbara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoff&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoff|first1=Wilfred Harvey|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|date=1912|publisher=London, Bombay &amp; Calcutta|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.asp|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century Berenice again become an active port, but after the 6th century the port was abandoned.  Under the [[Roman Empire]], Berenice formed a district unto itself, with its peculiar prefect, who was entitled ''Praefectus Berenicidis'', or ''P. montis Berenicidis''. (Orelli, ''Inscr. Lat.'' no. 3880, f.)

In 1818, the ruins of Berenice were identified by [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]], confirming an earlier opinion of [[D'Anville]]. Since then, several excavations have been undertaken. The port is now nearly filled up, has a sand-bar at its entrance and can be reached only by small craft.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Most important of the ruins is a temple; the remnants of its sculptures and inscriptions preserve the name of [[Tiberius]] and the figures of many deities, including a (goddess?) Alabarch or Arabarch, also the name of the head magistrate of the Jews in [[Alexandria]] under [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman rule]].  The temple is of sandstone and soft calcareous stone, in the Egyptian style. It is {{convert|102|ft|m}} long, and 43 wide. A portion of its walls is sculptured with well-executed basso relieves, of Greek workmanship, and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] also occasionally occur on the walls. Belzoni said that the city measured {{convert|1600|ft|m}} from north to south, and 2,000 from east to west. He estimated the ancient population at 10,000. (''Researches'', vol. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;73.)

Excavations were launched at Berenike in 1994 by a team of archaeologists from the [[University of Delaware]] led by Prof. Steven E. Sidebotham, with partners from several other institutions and continued until 2001. Work was resumed by teams from the University of Delaware and the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, [[University of Warsaw]], Poland, in the winter of 2007/2008 and is still continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl/index.php?id=80&amp;L=0|title=Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej UW: Berenike (Egypt)|last=www.grupamak.pl|first=Grupa MAK, Warszawa,|website=www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of significant finds have been made providing evidence of the cargo from the [[Malabar Coast]] and the presence of [[Tamil people]] from South India and [[Jaffna]] being at this last outpost of the Roman Empire.

:&quot;Among the unexpected discoveries at Berenike were a range of ancient Indian goods, including the largest single concentration (7.55 kg) of black peppercorns ever recovered in the classical Mediterranean world (“imported from southern India” and found inside a large vessel made of Nile silt in a temple courtyard); substantial quantities of Indian-made fine ware and kitchen cooking ware and Indian style pottery; Indian-made sail cloth, basketry, matting, etc. from trash dumps; a large quantity of teak wood, black pepper, coconuts, beads made of precious and semi-precious stones, cameo blanks; “a [[Tamil Brahmi]] graffito mentioning [[Korran|Korra]], a South Indian chieftain”; evidence that “inhabitants from Tamil South India (which then included most of Kerala) were living in Berenike, at least in the early Roman period”; evidence that the Tamil population implied the probable presence of Buddhist worshippers; evidence of Indians at another Roman port 300 km north of Berenike; Indian-made ceramics on the Nile road; a rock inscription mentioning an Indian passing through en route; “abundant evidence for the use of ships built and rigged in India”; and proof “that teak wood (endemic to South India), found in buildings in Berenike, had clearly been reused”(from dismantled ships).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2708/stories/20100423270806400.htm|title=South Indians in Roman Egypt?|website=www.frontline.in|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the first find of [[frankincense]] was reported and &quot;two blocks of resin from the Syrian fir tree (''[[Abies cilicica]]''), one weighting about 190 g and the other about 339 g, recovered from 1st-century AD contexts in one of the harbor trenches. Produced in areas of greater Syria and Asia Minor, this resin and its oil derivative were used in mummification, as an antiseptic, a diuretic, to treat wrinkles, extract worms and promote hair growth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl/index.php?id=253&amp;L=0|title=Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej UW: Berenike (Egypt)|last=www.grupamak.pl|first=Grupa MAK, Warszawa,|website=www.centrumarcheologii.uw.edu.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wadi Hammamat''' ({{lang-en|Valley of Many Baths}}) is a [[wadi|dry river bed]] in [[Egypt]]'s [[Eastern Desert]], about halfway between [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]] and [[Qena]]. It was a major [[mining]] region and [[trade route]] east from the [[Nile Valley]] in ancient times, and three thousand years of rock carvings and graffiti make it a major scientific and tourist site today.

==Trade route==

Hammamat became the major route from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to the [[Red Sea]] and then to the [[Silk Road]] that led to Asia, or to Arabia and the horn of Africa. This 200&amp;nbsp;km journey was the most direct route from the Nile to the [[Red Sea]], as the Nile bends toward the coast at the western end of the [[wadi]].

The Hammamat route ran from [[Qift]] (or Coptos), located just north of [[Luxor]], to [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]] on the coast of the Red Sea. Qift was an important center for administration, religion, and commerce. The cities at both ends of the route were established by the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], although evidence of [[predynastic]] occupation also has been found along the route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wadi.cd2.com/html/appendix_f.html The Archaeology of the Eastern Desert, Appendix F: Desert Rock Areas and Sites].  Andie Byrnes, University College London, June 2007.  Retrieved September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quarries==

In [[Ancient Egypt]] Hammamat was a major quarrying area for the [[Nile Valley]]. Quarrying expeditions to the [[Eastern Desert]] are recorded from the second millennia BCE, where the wadi has exposed [[Precambrian]] rocks of the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]]. These include [[Basalt]]s, [[schist]]s, ''bekhen''-stone (an especially prized green metagraywacke [[sandstone]] used for bowls, [[Cosmetic palette|palettes]], statues, and sarcophagi) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Quarries/Stones_List.html Survey of ancient Egyptian stone quarries (rock varieties and images, locations, and ages)]. James A. Harrell, Professor of Geology, Department of Environmental Sciences, [[University of Toledo]]. Retrieved September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and gold-containing [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, André, ''[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/mining.htm Mining]'', An introduction to the history and culture of Pharaonic Egypt. 2000. Retrieved September 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Narmer Palette]], 3100 BC, is one of a number of early and predynastic artifacts that were carved from the distinctive stone of the Wadi Hammamat. 

Pharaoh [[Seti I]] is recorded as having the first well dug to provide water in the wadi, and [[Senusret I]] sent mining expeditions there. The site is described in the earliest-known ancient [[geological map]], the [[Turin Papyrus Map]], describing a quarrying expedition prepared for [[Ramesses IV]].

==Carvings==

Today Hammamat is famous mostly for its ancient Egyptian [[graffiti]], as well as that, in ancient times, it was a [[quarry]] that lay on the [[Silk Road]] to Asia, and is a common destination for modern tourists. The wadi contains many carvings and inscriptions dating from before the earliest Egyptian Dynasties to the modern era, including the only painted [[petroglyph]] known from the Eastern Desert and drawings of Egyptian [[reed boat]]s dated to [[4000 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastern-desert.com/ Desert Boats Home Page] Wadi Hammamat: Gallery and description of several dynastic and predynastic sites in the Wadi, by Francis Lankester. Retrieved June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common era==

Occupying groups from the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] used both the route and the mines, the Romans establishing toll stations, the Byzantines reopening [[New Kingdom]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] mines at [[Bir Umm Fawakhir]], and both building [[watch tower]]s along the route that survive today. The Romans built a series of eight watering stages (hydreuma), one of which, the [[Qasr el Banat]], the ''Castle of the Maidens'', survives.

A modern asphalt road, the ''Wadi Hammamat road'' now runs for 194&amp;nbsp;km through the wadi, making it a vital transport route, and enabling tourists to travel easily between the sites of nearby Luxor and Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/red-sea/qift-to-quseir-egy-red-qq.htm planetware, detailed modern travel description].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern European description==

The first European descriptions of the Wadi Hammamat were from the Scottish traveler [[James Bruce]] in 1769, and the Russian [[Egyptologist]] [[Vladimir Golenishchev]] led the first modern study of the inscriptions in 1884-1885.

==Biblical significance==

[[Pi-hahiroth]] on the eastern shore of Sinai just south of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], near Thebes port of [[Elim (Bible)|Elim]], is recorded in the [[Book of Exodus]] as a stop on the flight of the Jews from Egypt, suggesting that their path was through the Wadi Hammamat.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Popular culture==

[[The Pogues]] wrote a song about it, entitled ''Girl From The Wadi Hammamat''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">The '''Edfu project''' is being undertaken with the primary goal of translations of inscriptions of an ancient temple of [[Edfu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Project5.html description] introductory statement&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1986, Professor Dr. Dieter Kurth of [[Hamburg University]] initiated a long-term project that is devoted to a complete translation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions of the [[Temple of Edfu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Project.html  brief details of temple] retrieved 18/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Temple.html temple plan and photographic] retrieved 18/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Upper [[Egypt]] (Temple of [[Horus]]) that meets the requirement of both linguistics and literary studies.
In addition, the research comprises all internal parallels, relevant literature and an analysis of the systematics behind the decoration. Comprehensive analytical indices – which are useful for researchers of related disciplines – and a grammar of [[Graeco-Roman]] temple inscriptions are compiled, too. Situated at the [[University of Hamburg]], the Edfu project was financed by the &quot;[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]]&quot; until 2001. Since 2002, the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen is in charge of the Edfu project, which is now financed by the &quot;Academies' Programme&quot;. The research unit works still at Hamburg University.
A translation of the inscriptions of the pylon (gate) including transcriptions and a commentary was published in 1998 (Edfou VIII). In 2004, it was followed by a translation of the inscriptions of the outer girdle wall (Edfou VII) some of which had not been published before. The most recent publication, released in 2014, provides a translation of the inscriptions of the inner side of the girdle wall (Edfou VI). Inscriptions of the open court and its columns (Chassinat, Edfou V-VI) are available in preliminary translation.

'''Medamud''' (from the Ancient Egyptian ''Madu'') was a settlement in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Its present-day territory is located about 8&amp;nbsp;km east-north from [[Luxor]].

A [[Temple of Monthu (Medamud)|temple of Montu]] was located here . It was excavated by [[Fernand Bisson de la Roque]] in 1925, who identified several structures dedicated to the war-god [[Montu]].

==History==
A simple temple of Montu existed here already towards the end of the Old Kingdom, or during the First Intermediate period. It was surrounded by a wall. It is now located below the present temple.

There were two pylons, one behind the other and, beyond them, there was a double cave sanctuary, the underground chambers of which were marked with mounds on the surface. These mounds of earth probably functioned as 'primeval mounds'.

During the Middle Kingdom's 12th dynasty, the old temple was completely rebuilt on a bigger scale.

Further building and renovation continued well into the time of the Roman Empire.

The pyramid at Meidum is thought to be just the second pyramid built after Djoser's&lt;ref&gt;Atalay, Bulent ''Math and the Mona Lisa'' (Smithsonian Books/HarperCollins, 2006), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been originally built for [[Huni]], the last pharaoh of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]], and was continued by [[Sneferu]]. The architect was a successor to the famous [[Imhotep]], the inventor of the stone built pyramid. The collapse of the pyramid is likely due to the modifications made to Imhotep's pyramid design as well as the decisions taken twice during construction to extend the pyramid. Because of its unusual appearance, the pyramid is called ''el-heram el-kaddaab'' &amp;mdash; (''Pseudo Pyramid'') in [[Egyptian Arabic]].

The second extension turned the original [[step pyramid]] design into a true pyramid by filling in the steps with limestone encasing. While this approach is consistent with the design of the other true pyramids, Meidum was affected by construction errors. Firstly, the outer layer was founded on sand and not on rock, like the inner layers. Secondly, the inner step pyramids had been designed as the final stage. Thus the outer surface was polished and the platforms of the steps were not horizontal, but fell off to the outside. This severely compromised the stability and is likely to have caused the collapse of the Meidum Pyramid in a downpour while the building was still under construction.&lt;ref name=K.Mendelssohn&gt;{{Citation

Franck Monnier&lt;ref&gt; Monnier, Franck ''L'ère des géants''; (Éditions de Boccard, Paris 2017) p.73-4 &lt;/ref&gt; and others believe the pyramid not to have collapsed until the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], but there are a number of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 12th dynasty all pyramids had a valley temple, which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple, which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid, apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two Steles inside, usually bearing the names of the pharaoh, are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted, with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally, the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from the outer cover were stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastrophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from 54 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at [[Dahshur]], the [[Bent Pyramid]].&lt;ref name=K.Mendelssohn /&gt;


By the time it was investigated by [[Napoleon]]'s Expedition in 1799 the Meidum Pyramid had its present three steps. It is commonly assumed the pyramid still had five steps in the fifteenth century and was gradually falling further into ruin, because [[al-Maqrizi]] described it as looking like a five-stepped mountain, but Mendelssohn claimed this might be the result of a loose translation and al-Makrizi's words would more accurately translate into &quot;five-storied mountain&quot;,&lt;ref name=K.Mendelssohn /&gt; a description which could even match the present state of the pyramid with four bands of different masonry at the base and a step on top.

==Excavations==

The Meidum Pyramid  was excavated by [[John Shae Perring]] in 1837, [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]] in 1843 and then by [[Flinders Petrie]] later in the nineteenth century, who located the mortuary temple, facing to the east. In 1920 [[Ludwig Borchardt]] studied the area further, followed by [[Alan Rowe (archaeologist)|Alan Rowe]] in 1928 and then Ali el-Kholi in the 1970s.
[[File:Mortuary Temple at Meidum.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Mortuary Temple of Meidum Pyramid]]
In its ruined state, the structure is {{convert|213|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high, and its entrance is aligned north-south, with the entrance in the north, {{convert|66|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above present ground level. The steep descending passage {{convert|57|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long leads to a horizontal passage, just below the original ground level, that then leads to a vertical shaft {{convert|10|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high that leads to the corbelled burial chamber itself. The chamber is unlikely to have been used for any burial.

Flinders Petrie was the first [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]] to establish the facts of its original design dimensions and proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbody 2008: 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1979: 269&lt;/ref&gt; In its final form it was 1100 [[cubit]]s of 0.523&amp;nbsp;m around by 175 Cubits high, thus showing the same proportions as the Great Pyramid at Giza, and therefore the same circular symbolism. Petrie wrote in the 1892 excavation report &lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1892: 6&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;We see then that there is an exactly analogous theory for the dimensions of Medum[sic] to that of the Great Pyramid ; in each the approximate ratio of 7 : 44 is adopted, as referred to the radius and circle&amp;nbsp;...&quot; These proportions equated to the four outer faces sloping in by precisely 51.842° or 51° 50' 35&quot;, which would have been understood and expressed by the Ancient Egyptians as a [[seked]] slope of 5½ palms &lt;ref&gt;Verner. The Pyramids. Their Archaeology and History. 2003 pp462&lt;/ref&gt;

Located nearby is a [[mastaba]] of an unknown noble, the burial chamber of which can be entered via a robber's tunnel. This tunnel is steep, extremely narrow and confined. Once traversed however, the chamber and hallway are relatively spacious, and contain the first example of a red granite sarcophagus known in antiquity. Another mastaba is the Mastaba of [[Nefermaat]], the son of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] founder Pharaoh [[Sneferu]].

The stone [[sarcophagus]] remains within the unmarked and undecorated granite built chamber. The tunnel goes farther on into the darkness, and as of 2002 remains unexplored.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Image:pyramid of amenemhet hawarra 01.jpg|thumb|390px|The Pyramid of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Amenemhat III]] at Hawara, from the east.]]
'''Hawara''' is an archaeological site of [[Ancient Egypt]], south of the site of [[Crocodilopolis]] ('Arsinoe', also known as 'Medinet al-Faiyum') at the entrance to the depression of the [[Al Fayyum|Fayyum]] oasis. The first  excavations at the site were made by [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Karl Lepsius]], in 1843.  [[William Flinders Petrie]] excavated at Hawara, in 1888, finding [[papyrus|papyri]] of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, and, north of the pyramid, a vast [[necropolis]] where he found 146 portraits on coffins dating to the Roman period, famous as being among the very few surviving examples of painted portraits from [[Classical Antiquity]], the [[Fayum mummy portraits|&quot;Fayoum portraits&quot;]] illustrated in Roman history textbooks.
[[File:Labyrinth, fire altar. Part of a limestone frieze, model of lamps on a stand. 12th Dynasty. From Hawara, Fayum, Egypt.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
[[Amenemhat III]] was the last powerful ruler of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]], and the pyramid he built at Hawara (''illustration, right'') is believed to post-date the so-called &quot;Black Pyramid&quot; built by the same ruler at [[Dahshur]]. This is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place. At Hawara there was also the intact (pyramid) tomb of [[Neferu-Ptah]], daughter of Amenemhet III. This tomb was found about 2&amp;nbsp;km South of the king's pyramid.

In common with the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] pyramids constructed after [[Amenemhat II]], it was built of [[mudbrick]] round a core of limestone passages and burial chambers, and faced with limestone. Most of the facing stone was later pillaged for use in other buildings&amp;mdash; a fate common to almost all of Egypt's pyramids&amp;mdash; and today the pyramid is little more than an eroded, vaguely pyramidal mountain of mud brick, and of the once magnificent mortuary temple precinct formerly enclosed by a wall there is little left beyond the foundation bed of compacted sand and chips and shards of limestone.

From the pyramid entrance a sloping passageway with steps runs down to a small room and a further short horizontal passage. In the roof of this horizontal passage there was a concealed sliding trapdoor weighing 20 tons. If this was found and opened a robber would find himself confronted by an empty passage at a right angle to the passage below, closed by wooden doors, or by a passage parallel to the passage below, carefully filled with mud and stone blocking. He would assume that the blocking concealed the entrance and waste time removing it (thereby increasing the likelihood of detection by the pyramid guardians).

In fact there was a second 20-ton trapdoor in the roof of the empty passage, giving onto a second empty passage, also at a right angle to the first. This too had a 20-ton trapdoor giving onto a passage at a right angle to its predecessor (thus the interior of the pyramid was circled by these passages). However this passage ended in a large area of mud and stone blocking that presumably concealed the burial chamber.

This, however, was a blind and merely filled a wide but shallow alcove. Two blind shafts in the floor, carefully filled with cut stone blocks, further wasted the robbers' time, for the real entrance to the burial chamber was even more carefully concealed and lay between the blind shafts and opposite the alcove.

Despite these elaborate protective measures, Petrie found that none of the trapdoors had been slid into place and the wooden doors were open. Whether this indicated negligence on the part of the burial party, an intention to return and place further burials in the pyramid (when found there were two sarcophagii in the quartzite monolith described below and room for at least two more), or a deliberate action to facilitate robbery of the tomb, we cannot know.

The burial chamber was made out of a single quartzite monolith which was lowered into a larger chamber lined with [[limestone]]. This monolithic slab weighed an estimated 110 tons according to Petrie. A course of brick was placed on the chamber to raise the ceiling then the chamber was covered with 3 quartzite slabs (estimated weight 45 tons each). Above the burial chamber were 2 relieving chambers. This was topped with 50 ton limestone slabs forming a pointed roof. Then an enormous arch of brick 3 feet thick was built over the pointed roof to support the core of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947 p. 237-240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amenemhet3hp.htm|title=The Pyramid of Amenemhet III at Hawara in Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti, Alberto, Zahi Hawass, 1997 &quot;Guide to the Pyramids of Egypt&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The entrance to the pyramid is today flooded to a depth of 6 metres as a result of the waters from the Bahr Yusuf (Joseph's Canal) canal, which flows around two sides of the site and passes within 30m of the pyramid.

[[Image:Hawara MoS 1911.210.1.JPG|thumb|right|Petrie unearthed a number of vivid [[Fayoum mummy portraits]] in 1911]]
The huge mortuary temple that originally stood adjacent to this pyramid is believed to have formed the basis of the complex of buildings with galleries and courtyards called a &quot;labyrinth&quot; by  [[Herodotus]] (see quote at [[Labyrinth]]), and mentioned by [[Strabo]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]]. (There is no historicity to the assertion of [[Diodorus Siculus]] that this was the model for the labyrinth of [[Crete]] that Greeks imagined housed the [[Minotaur]],) The demolition of the &quot;labyrinth&quot; may date in part to the reign of [[Ptolemy II]], under whom the Pharaonic city of [[Shedyt]] (Greek ''Crocodilopolis'', the modern Medinet el-Fayum) was renamed to honour his sister-wife [[Arsinoe II of Egypt|Arsinoë]]; a  massive Ptolemaic building program at Arsinoe has been suggested as the ultimate destination of Middle Kingdom limestone columns and blocks removed from Hawara, and now lost.

Queen [[Sobekneferu]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth dynasty]] also built at the complex. Her name meant &quot;most beautiful of [[Sobek]]&quot;, the sacred crocodile.

Among the discoveries made by Flinders Petrie were [[papyrus]] manuscripts, including a great papyrus scroll which contains parts of books 1 and 2 of the ''[[Iliad]]'' (the &quot;Hawara Homer&quot; of the [[Bodleian Library]],  Oxford).

The '''Cave of Swimmers''' is a [[cave]] with ancient [[rock art]] in the mountainous [[Gilf Kebir]] [[plateau]] of the [[Libyan Desert]] section of the [[Sahara]]. It is located in the [[New Valley Governorate]] of southwest [[Egypt]], near the border with [[Libya]].

==History==
The cave and rock art was discovered in October 1933 by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] explorer [[László Almásy]]. It contains [[Neolithic]] [[pictograph]]s (rock painting images) and is named due to the depictions of people with their limbs bent as if they were swimming. The drawings include those of giraffe and hippopotamus.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = African rock art image project|url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/african_rock_art_image_project/featured_sites/wadi_sura.aspx|website = British Museum|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are estimated to have been created as early as 10,000 years ago with the beginning of the [[African humid period|African Humid Period]], when the Sahara was significantly greener and wetter than it is today. The cause of the climate change 10,000 years ago is unknown.

Almásy devoted a chapter to the cave in his 1934 book, ''The Unknown Sahara''. In it he postulates that the swimming scenes are real depictions of life at the time of painting and that the artists had realistically drawn their surroundings and that there had been a [[climate change]] from [[Temperateness|temperate]] to [[xeric]] [[desert]] since that time making it drier.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancient-origins.net&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Debate over 7,000-year-old rock art in barren Sahara Desert that may depict people swimming|url = http://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/debate-over-7000-year-old-rock-art-barren-sahara-desert-020162|website = Ancient Origins|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was so new at that time that his first editor added several footnotes, to make it clear that he did not share this opinion.  In 2007, [[Eman Ghoneim]] discovered an ancient mega-lake (30,750&amp;nbsp;km²) buried beneath the sand of the Great Sahara in the Northern Darfur region, [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=newsci_lake&gt;{{cite web|last=Brahic|first=Catherine|title=Ancient mega-lake discovered in Darfur|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11593|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=31 December 2012|date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave is mentioned in [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s novel ''[[The English Patient]]''. The [[The English Patient (film)|film adaptation]] has a scene in it that has a guide describing in his native language to Almásy the location that Almásy renders a drawing and includes some text that is then placed in the book that he keeps for himself.&lt;ref&gt;In the film, a native guide in his own language is describing to Almásy the location of the caves; the scene is that just before the arrival by plane at the base camp by the Cliftons.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave shown in the film is not the original but a [[film set]] created by a contemporary artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Present day==

Physical scientists who have been doing research in the area drew a provisional link between the proposed swimming humans and two lakes that are 124 miles (or 200&amp;nbsp;km) south of the cave. However, Andras Zboray, an archaeologist who is doing research in the area, questions whether the figures are swimming or not. He believes that the drawings are &quot;clearly symbolic...with an unknown meaning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ancient-origins.net&quot;/&gt;

Other researchers such as German ethnologist [[:de:Hans Rhotert|Hans Rhotert]], who was involved in rock art research in North Africa and the Middle East, was the first to interpret these drawings as being that of deceased people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bárta&quot; &gt;{{Cite web|title = Swimmers in the Sand by Dr. Miroslav Bárta |url = http://www.drhawass.com/wp/souvlaki-ignitus-carborundum-4/|website = www.drhawass.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Jean-Loïc Le Quellec|Jean-Loïc Le Quellec]], a doctor of anthropology, ethnology and prehistory, agrees with Rhotert. He has pointed out parallels to the [[Coffin Texts]] indicating that the figures are deceased souls floating in the waters of Nun.

Due to similar artwork being found in nearby caves, such as the [[Cave of Beasts]], and the continuous line that the figures create extending across a majority of the cave's interior has led researchers to believe that the cave art may display developing concepts that were later adapted to the configuration of the Nile valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bárta&quot; /&gt;

Substantial portions of the cave have been irreversibly damaged by visitors over the years, especially since the film was released in 1996. Fragments of the paintings have been removed as souvenirs and some surfaces have cracked after water was applied to 'enhance' their contrast for photographs. Modern [[graffiti]] have been inscribed upon the wall and tourist [[litter]]ing is a problem.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Steps have been taken to reduce future damage by training guides and clearing litter from the vicinity, but this important rock art site remains fragile and risks future disturbances as tourist traffic to the region increases.

[[File:Dendera Temple.jpg|thumb|right|General view of Dendera Temple complex]]
[[File:Dendera 7 977.PNG|thumb|right|Temple of Hathor, Dendera]]

'''Dendera Temple complex''' ([[Demotic Egyptian|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''Iunet'' or ''Tantere''; the 19th-century English spelling in most sources, including [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Belzoni]], was '''Tentyra''') is located about {{convert|2.5|km}} south-east of [[Dendera]], [[Egypt]]. It is one of the best-preserved [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in Egypt. The area was used as the sixth [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]], south of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].

==Description==
[[File:Mudbrick compound walls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The massive mudbrick compound walls seen from the temple roof.]]The whole complex covers some 40,000 square meters and is surrounded by a hefty mud brick enclosed wall. Dendera was a site for chapels or shrines from the beginning of history of ancient Egypt. It seems that pharaoh [[Pepi I]] (ca. 2250 BC) built on this site and evidence exists of a temple in the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] (ca 1500 BC). However, the earliest extant building in the compound today is the [[Mammisi]] raised by [[Nectanebo II]] – last of the native [[pharaoh]]s (360–343 BC). The features in the complex include: 
* Hathor temple (the main temple)
* Temple of the birth of Isis
* Sacred Lake
* Sanatorium
* Mammisi of Nectanebo II
* Christian Basilica
* Roman Mammisi
* a Barque shrine
* Gateways of [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]]
* the Roman Kiosk

==Hathor temple==

[[File:Plan of Temple of Hathor.jpg|thumb|300px|Plan of Hathor Temple]]
The all overshadowing building in the Complex is the main temple, namely '''Hathor temple''' (historically called the '''Temple of Tentyra''').  The temple has been modified on the same site starting as far back as the [[History of Ancient Egypt#Middle Kingdom|Middle Kingdom]], and continuing right up until the time of the Roman emperor [[Trajan]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ann Kipfer, &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306461587&amp;id=XneTstDbcC0C Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology]''&quot;.  Page 153&lt;/ref&gt; The existing structure was built no later than the late [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]]. The temple, dedicated to [[Hathor]], is one of the best preserved temples in all Egypt. Subsequent additions were added in Roman times.

Layout elements of the temple:
* Large [[Hypostyle Hall]]
* Small Hypostyle Hall
* Laboratory
* Storage magazine
* Offering entry
* [[Treasury]]
* Exit to well
* Access to stairwell
* [[Offering hall]]
* Hall of the [[Ennead]]
* Great Seat and main sanctuary
* Shrine of the Nome of Dendera
* Shrine of [[Isis]]
* Shrine of [[Seker|Sokar]]
* Shrine of [[Harsomtus]]
* Shrine of Hathor's [[Sistrum]]
* Shrine of gods of [[Lower Egypt]]
* Shrine of [[Hathor]]
* Shrine of the throne of Rê
* Shrine of [[Rê]]
* Shrine of [[Menat]] collar
* Shrine of [[Ihy]]
* [[The Pure Place]]
* Court of the First Feast
* Passage
* Staircase to roof

Depictions of [[Cleopatra VI]] which appear on temple walls are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pentland Mahaffy]], &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0j3YkB6wR7Fox7erT7pYM7j&amp;id=HiANAAAAIAAJ A History of Egypt Under the Ptolemaic Dynasty]''&quot;. Methuen &amp; Co., 1899. 261 pages. Page 237 and 248.&lt;/ref&gt; On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popularly well known [[Cleopatra]]) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar ([[Caesarion]]), fathered by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahaffy, Page 251.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Dendera zodiac===
[[File:Dendera.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Denderah zodiac]]
{{Main|Dendera zodiac}}
The sculptured ''Dendera zodiac'' (or ''Denderah zodiac'') is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] (the [[bull]]) and the [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] (the [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]]). A sketch was made of it during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|Napoleonic campaign in Egypt]]. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by French colonizers and replaced with a fake. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. The real one is now in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/egypts-most-wanted-an-antiquities-wish-list|title=Egypt’s Most Wanted: An Antiquities Wish List|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Champollion]]'s guess that it was Ptolemaic proved to be correct, and Egyptologists now date it to the first century BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/zodiac_dendera.shtml Napoleon and the Scientific Expedition to Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necropolis and crypts===

The '''Dendera necropolis''' is a series of [[mastaba]] [[tomb]]s. The [[necropolis]] dates from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] of the [[Old Kingdom]] to the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ann Kipfer, &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306461587&amp;id=XneTstDbcC0C Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology]''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The necropolis runs the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain. The subterranean ''Hathor temple tombs'' total 12 chambers. Some reliefs are dated to as late as the Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos reign. The [[crypt]]s reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the &quot;Flame Room&quot; floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I. He offers a statuette of the god [[Ihy]] to four images of Hathor. In the crypt, reached from the &quot;throne room&quot;, [[Ptolemy XII]] has jewelry and offerings for the gods.

===The Dendera light===
{{main|Dendera light}}
[[File:Dendera light 002.jpg|250px|thumb|Dendera light, showing the single representation on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts]]
Hathor Temple has a relief sometimes known as the [[Dendera light]] because of a controversial fringe thesis about its nature. The ''Dendera light'' images comprise five stone reliefs (two of which contain a pair of what fringe authors refer to as lights) in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex located in [[Egypt]]. The view of [[Egyptologist]]s is that the relief is a [[Egyptian mythology|mythological]] depiction of a [[djed]] pillar and a [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]] flower, spawning a snake within, representing aspects of [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Waitkus, ''Die Texte in den unteren Krypten des Hathortempels von Dendera: ihre Aussagen zur Funktion und Bedeutung dieser Räume'', Mainz 1997 {{ISBN|3-8053-2322-0}} (tr., ''The texts in the lower crypts of the Hathor tempels of Dendera: their statements for the function and meaning of these areas'')
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://users.iafrica.com/g/gr/grenvill/denderah.htm Dendera Temple Crypt]''&quot;. iafrica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this interpretation, there is a [[fringe science]] suggestion that it is actually a representation of an Ancient Egyptian lightbulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0MoAQAAIAAJ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieheW7nubUAhWGEVAKHaUQDHM4ChDoAQgwMAM |title=Max Planck Forschung |year=2000 |page=72 |chapter=Fantastereien |first=Helmut |last=Hornung |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceiling cleaning===

[[File:Ceiling of Temple of Hathor.JPG|thumb|Recently cleaned ceiling of the Temple of Hathor]]
The ceiling of the Hathor Temple has recently been cleaned in a careful way that removed hundreds of years of black soot without harming the ancient paint underneath. Spectacular ceiling painting has been exposed in the main hall, and some of the most vibrant and colourful paintings dating from antiquity are now visible.

==Tourism==
The Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It used to be possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof. However, the highest part of the roof of Hathor temple has been closed since 2003. The second stage of the roof was closed in November 2004, after a tourist got too close to the edge and fell to her death on the bedrock below.

[[Image:Necheb Tempel Amenophis III. 01.JPG|thumb|Temple of Amenhotep III at El Kab]]
{{Egyptian Location | Location=Eileithuia / el-Kab| Left=126 | Top=118 | }}
'''El Kab''' (or better Elkab) is an [[Upper Egypt]]ian site on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the mouth of the Wadi Hillal about {{convert|80|km}} south of [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]). El Kab was called '''Nekheb''' in the [[Egyptian language]], a name that refers to [[Nekhbet]], the goddess depicted as a white [[vulture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Limme&quot;&gt;Limme, Luc. &quot;Elkab, 1937–2007: Seventy Years of Belgian Archaeological Research.&quot; British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan (2008): 15-50. The British Museum. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Limme.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

El Kab consists of [[prehistoric Egypt|prehistoric]] and [[ancient Egypt]]ian settlements, [[rock-cut tomb]]s of the early [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (1550–1295 BC), remains of temples dating from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic period]] (3100–2686 BC) to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] (332–30 BC), as well as part of the walls of a [[Coptic monasticism|Coptic monastery]].  This site was first scientifically excavated by [[James Quibell]] at the end of the nineteenth century, but other archaeologists have spent time at this site include Frederick William Green, Archibald Henry Sayce, Joseph John Tylor, and Somers Clarke.  However, Belgian archaeologists took over the project in 1937, and it has remained in their hands since then.   Much of the research done at this site took place within the town enclosure of El-Kab.  However, since the 1980s the work has shifted more to the north and north east of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Limme, Luc. &quot;Elkab, 1937–2007: Seventy Years of Belgian Archaeological Research.&quot; British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan (2008): 15-50. The British Museum. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Limme.pdf&gt;. page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of site==
[[File:Fragment of a relief block or stela. Standing male figure below hieroglyphs. Limestone. 4th Dynasty. From the mastaba of Kameni (Ka-Mena) at El Kab (Nekheb), Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Fragment of a relief block or stela. Standing male figure below hieroglyphs. Limestone. 4th Dynasty. From the mastaba of Kameni (Ka-Mena) at El Kab (Nekheb), Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]

El-Kab is in Upper Egypt, located on the east side of the Nile River, almost to the opposite of Hierakonpolis (on the other side of the river) and about fifty miles above Thebes. With the way the river meandered and eroded the rocks and sand, the Nile River is almost level with the town, but according to Clarke Somers in his journal article “El-Kab and the Great Wall,” “in its early youth the town must have stood well above the flood waters.”&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Somers. &quot;El-Kâb and the Great Wall.&quot; The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 7 (1921): 54-79.{{jstor|10.2307/3853817}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The site could be described as a bay between sandstone cliffs to the north and south, and this same sandstone was used to build the temples found in this site.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Clarke, Somers. &quot;El-Kâb and the Great Wall.&quot; The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 7 (1921): 54-79.{{jstor|10.2307/3853817}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First excavation==
During Quibell's first excavation, most of the work was done in the cemetery east of the town.  There Quibell found many buried skeletons, all with their heads pointing towards the north, and none of them mummified.  This being the earliest cemetery at the site, pots, bead, paint slabs and mirrors were found in these burials, but no papyrus or text were found anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Quibell, J. E. &quot;The Egyptian Research Account at El Kab.&quot; The Biblical World 9.5 (1897): 380. {{jstor|3140294}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Nekheb==
[[File:Calcite model shell, inscribed with cartouche &quot;Beloved of Nekheb&quot;. 19th Dynasty. From El Kab, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Calcite model shell, inscribed with cartouche &quot;Beloved of Nekheb&quot;. 19th Dynasty. From El Kab, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
The walled settlement of Nekheb was one of the first urban centres of the Early Dynastic period, and for a short time in the New Kingdom (1550–1069 BC) it eclipsed in the city of [[Nekhen]] or Hierakonpolis on the opposite bank, becoming the capital of the [[Nome (Egypt)|third nome]] of Upper Egypt. Its massive mudbrick walls, dating to the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (747–332 BC) and thought to have been built by [[Nectanebo II]] as a defensive measure, are still largely preserved. They enclose an area of about {{convert|25000|m2}}.

Near the centre of the Nekheb are the remains of sandstone temples dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities]] [[Nekhbet]] and [[Thoth]] that date primarily to the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] to [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]] Dynasties (1550–343 BCE), but the original foundation of the temple of Nekhbet almost certainly dates back to the late fourth millennium BC.

===Necropolis===
The necropolis has some important tombs, showing the early history of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the reunification of Egypt. The rock tombs of the provincial governors of Nekheb in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] include those of [[Sobeknakht II]] an important official whose saved the Theban [[Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixteenth]] or [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]] from near destruction by invading forces from the [[Kingdom of Kush]], [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], an admiral in the wars of liberation against the [[Hyksos]] rulers (''c.'' 1550 BCE), and [[Setau]], a priest during the reign of [[Ramesses II]] (1184–1153 BCE). The style of the early Eighteenth Dynasty wallpaintings anticipates that of the first New Kingdom nobles' tombs at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].

==Ptolemaic and Roman eras==
During the Greco-Roman period, the town flourished and became known as '''Eileithyias polis''' ({{lang-la|Lucinae Civitas}}).This village may have thrived for a little while, but it seems that in 380, the city was demolished, either from military or political events. All that remains of the actual buildings are the lower parts of the walls of the houses, but luckily many of the artifacts that would have been inside the houses remained. Coins from the first to fourth century were recovered along with [[Demotic Greek]] and [[ostracon|ostraca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Limme&quot;/&gt;

==Walls==
One of the discoveries at the site that Quibell questioned the most during his dig was the walls that surrounded the Serdab. However, much more research has been done since then, and according to a journal article published by the &quot;British Museum of Ancient Egypt and Sudan&quot;, the walls date to about the 30th Dynasty, or about the 4th century BC.  In 1921, an article titled &quot;El-Kab and the Great Wall&quot; was published in &quot;The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology&quot;, and it explained further the three different sets of walls and what they were used for.  The first set of walls (the word set being used to describe a double range of walls) &quot;encloses part of the ancient town, second a double range [encloses] the temple group, and lastly, most conspicuous of the three, the great and massive wall [cuts] across the site of the ancient town.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;   This last wall mentioned surrounds a plot of land that had never actually been inhabited.  After some time, because the movement of the Nile River towards the city had threatened to destroy the construction, the original wall around the city could no longer be useful. The Egyptians had to construct a new wall, farther from the Nile, so that the people could continue to build their houses and live in an area safe from destruction.  James Breasted also mentions these walls in an account he wrote of the site in 1897.  In his article he states with admiration that, &quot;it is the only city of remote antiquity the walls of which still stand almost intact.  From the cliffs back of the town one may look down upon it, stretched out beneath one's feet, and almost see the majestic temple, surrounded by the beautiful villas of the feudal lords, whose soldiery once manned the now silent walls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, James Henry. &quot;Excavations of the Egyptian Research Account at El Kab.&quot; The Biblical World 9.3 (1897): 219. {{jstor|3140415}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to describe these walls as sun baked brick that are laid thirty-eight feet thick, and surround an enclosure two thousand feet long and fifteen hundred feet wide.

==Ancient campsites==

In 1967 Pierre Vermeersch discovered a series of well-stratified [[Epipaleolithic]] campsites.&lt;ref&gt;P. Vermeersch, 'L'Elkabien.  Une nouvelle industrie epipaleolithique a Elkab en Haute Egypte, sa stratigraphic, sa typologie'. ''CdE'' 45 (1970), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/319794/1/Vermeersch+1970+Elkab.pdf 45-68.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Radiocarbon-dated to ''c.''6400-5980 BC, these are the type-sites of the Elkabian microlithic industry, filling a gap in the prehistoric cultural sequence of Egypt between the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (''c.'' 10,000 BC) and the earliest [[Neolithic]] (''c.'' 5500 BC).

==Ancient texts==
Since the 1980s, even more discoveries have been made.  The surrounding hills are inscribed with petroglyphs that range in time period, from Predynastic to Islamic times, not to mention hieroglyphics that also vary in date (but for the most part were written during the 6th dynasty).  At first, many thought these inscriptions to be similar to modern day graffiti&amp;nbsp;– random phrases written by passerby and travelers.  However, once further studied, it was realized that these phrases are actually short texts that mention the inhabitants of the town.   This is very interesting, because it tells us that Egyptians took note of who lived in what villages, or at least who lived in El-Kab.  Of course, these inscriptions are only dated from the Sixth Dynasty, but it still tells us a little bit about what they valued.&lt;ref&gt;Limme, Luc. &quot;Elkab, 1937–2007: Seventy Years of Belgian Archaeological Research.&quot; British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan (2008): 15-50. The British Museum. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. &lt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Limme.pdf&gt;. page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="793">'''El-Gabal el-Ahmar''' {{lang-ar|الجبل الأحمر}} is located today within the boundaries of modern-day [[Cairo]], in the area of [[Nasr City]], (30.05 N, 31.3 E)  .  The name means &quot;The Red Hill&quot;. The site was in full production in the times of [[Akhenaton]], [[Amenhophis III]], [[Tutankhamon]] and [[Ramses III]].  The quarry was directed by Huy also known as &quot;Chief of the King's Works&quot; and also by Hori.

The famous [[Colossi of Memnon]] are made from blocks of [[quartzite|quartzite sandstone]] probably quarried at ''el-Gabal el-Ahmar''.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
The cemetery was excavated in two seasons by [[Flinders Petrie]]. Tombs of almost all periods were found, but most importantly many belonging to the time of Egyptian state formation, the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic]] period around 3100 BC. Petrie found more than 2,000 tombs, most of them simple holes in the ground belonging to common people. However, there were also several [[mastaba]]s of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], decorated with a palace facade.

The most important finds include a tomb with many seal impressions belonging to king [[Narmer]] and one of the oldest dresses found in Egypt. The cemeteries of the later periods are called Kafr Ammar, although lying side by side with the earlier tombs. From a Roman period tomb came a [[Fayum portrait]].

==Tomb 1060==
Tomb 1060 is the biggest of the palace facade [[mastaba]]s at Tarkhan. The mastaba was divided into several rooms, most likely used for storing burial goods, although little survived. In the middle was the underground burial chamber with four small side chambers not connected by doorways, but there were doors incised on the walls acting as symbolic chambers. The niches of the palace facade were painted red; only one niche, with a wooden floor, was unpainted. This might indicate a cult place for the deceased. Around the mastaba there was a wall.

The '''Temple of Kalabsha''' (also '''Temple of Mandulis''') is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] that was originally located at Bab al-Kalabsha (Gate of Kalabsha), approximately 50 km south of [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Atlas of the Land of the Pharaohs, Hermes House:Anness Publishing Ltd, 2003. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was situated on the west bank of the [[Nile River]], in [[Nubia]], and was originally built around 30 BC during the early [[Roman empire|Roman]] era. While the temple was constructed in [[Augustus]]'s reign, it was never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple was a tribute to [[Mandulis]] (Merul), a Lower Nubian sun god.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamil&quot;/&gt; It was constructed over an earlier sanctuary of Amenhotep II.&lt;ref&gt;David, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is 76 m long and 22 m wide in dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/590/hr1.htm |title=New Kalabsha at Aswan |date=June 13, 2002 |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the structure dates to the Roman period, it features many fine reliefs such as &quot;a fine carving of Horus emerging from reeds on the inner curtain wall&quot; of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, ''Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A Complete Guide to Ancient Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; From Kalabsha's &quot;sanctuary chambers, a staircase leads up to the roof of the temple&quot; where one can see a splendid view of the temple itself and the sacred lake.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;  Several historical records were inscribed on the temple walls of Kalabsha such as &quot;a long inscription carved by the Roman Governor Aurelius Besarion in AD 250, forbidding pigs in the temple&quot; as well as an inscription of &quot;the Nubian king Silko, carved during the 5th century and recording his victory over the [[Blemmyes]] and a picture of him dressed as a Roman soldier on horseback.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Silko was the Christian king of the Nubian kingdom of [[Nobatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use and movement of the temples==

When [[Christianity]] was introduced to [[Egypt]], the temple was used as a church.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamil, Jill |title=Upper Egypt and Nubia: The Antiquities from Amarna to Abu Simbel |publisher=Egyptian International Publishing Company |date=1996 |pages=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from [[Germany]], the temple of Kalabsha was relocated after the [[Aswan High Dam]] was built, to protect it from rising waters on [[Lake Nasser]]. The temple was moved to a [[New Kalabsha|site]], located just south of the Aswan High Dam.  The process of moving the temple took more than two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamil&quot;/&gt; The temple of Kalabsha was the largest free-standing temple of Egyptian Nubia (after Abu Simbel) to be moved and erected at a new site.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., 1997. p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Although the building was never completed, it &quot;is regarded as one of the best examples of Egyptian architecture in Nubia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--{{for|the leafhoppers genus in the subfamily [[Deltocephalinae]]|Ballana (genus)}}--&gt;
'''Ballana''' was a cemetery in [[Lower Nubia]]. It was excavated by [[Walter Bryan Emery]] along with nearby [[Qustul]] between 1928 and 1931 as a rescue project before a second rising of the [[Aswan Low Dam]]. A total of 122 tombs were found under huge artificial mounds. They date to the time after the collapse of the Meroitic state but before the founding of the Christian Nubian kingdoms, around AD 350 to 600. They usually featured one or several underground chambers, with one main burial chamber. Some tombs were found unlooted, but even the robbed burials still proved to contain many burial goods.

The objects found are chiefly of [[Nubia]]n origin, but there were also many objects imported from Byzantine Egypt and the Mediterranean in general. Most remarkable is a set of crowns from different tombs showing that the richest burials belong to local ruling kings and queens. There were horses and servants buried with their masters. There are few written objects in the burials. The identification of the tomb owners is, therefore, impossible. It has been assumed that these are the burials of the kings and the court of [[Nobatia]].

One important tomb discovered here was tomb 118 which consisted of three chambers. It might be described as an example of a royal burial at Ballana and consisted of a main burial chamber and two storage rooms. The roof of the burial chamber had collapsed and the tomb, therefore, escaped looting. The body of the person buried here was found on a bier. It was most likely that of a king. Upon his head was found a crown. Under the bier, were the remains of a large wooden gaming board, weapons and an iron folding chair. There were also skeletons of a young male servant and a cow. In the two storerooms, more skeletons of servants, as well as pottery and several bronze lamps were discovered.

The Ballana tombs belong to a culture complex often called [[X-Group]]. Following the find of these tombs, this culture is most often called ''Ballana Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Trigger|TRIGGER, Bruce]] (1978). The Ballana Culture and the Coming of Christianity. In: ''The Essays'', edited by S. Hochfield and E. Riefstahl, 107-19. Vol.1 of ''Africa in Antiquity: The Arts of Ancient Nubia and the Sudan''. Brooklyn: Brooklyn Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Ballana cemetery is now flooded by the [[Lake Nasser|Nasser Lake]].

'''Riqqeh''' (also known as '''ar-Riqqeh''' or '''Riqqa''') is a modern village in [[Egypt]]. It is located about 80&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Cairo]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Jar inscribed with the prenomen and nomen of Amenmesse. Faience, cylindrical. 19th Dynasty. From Cemetery C at el-Riqqeh, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|left|Jar inscribed with the prenomen and nomen of Amenmesse. Faience, cylindrical. 19th Dynasty. From Cemetery C at el-Riqqeh, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
Close to the village, in the desert, was excavated a series of cemeteries. The cemeteries ranging in time from the [[Gerzeh culture]] to modern times. Most important are those tombs dating to the Gerzeh (named for the El Gerzeh cemetery) and those of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]s. The cemeteries were excavated and published by [[Reginald Engelbach]] in 1912 to 1913.

Most of the tombs found were simple shafts, some with one or more chambers at the bottom. Finds include [[stele]]s, statues and [[canopic jars]]. From the Middle Kingdom some well preserved and decorated coffins are preserved. Most remarkable was in undisturbed tomb containing two skeletons and golden jewellery. A closer look at this burial revealed that one of the skeletons belonged to the person buried here, while the other one belonged to the tomb robber, who died because the roof of the tomb chamber collapsed while he was looting the mummy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">The '''New Wadi es-Sabua''' is an archaeological site in Egypt. It is located only 4&amp;nbsp;km west from the original site of [[Wadi es-Sebua]] which today contains three [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temples]] in Lower Nubia, the temples of Wadi-es Sebua, Maharraqa and Dakka respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.1177&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Temple of Maharraqa}}
The temple of Maharraqa was an Ancient Egyptian Roman period temple that was never completed.

==Temple of Dakka==
{{main|Temple of Dakka}}

[[Image:David Roberts Rock Temple Gerf Hussein.jpg|thumb|Painting of the inside rock-cut temple of Gerf Hussein by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1838)]]
The temple of '''Gerf Hussein''' was originally a partly free-standing, and partly rock-cut (i.e. hemispeos) temple of pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], which was built by the Viceroy of Nubia, [[Setau]], at a site some 90&amp;nbsp;km south of Aswan.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.98&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to &quot;[[Ptah]], Ptah-Tatenen and [[Hathor]], and associated with Ramesses, 'the Great God.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.260&lt;/ref&gt; Gerf Hussein was known as Per Ptah or the &quot;House of Ptah.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; An avenue of ram headed sphinxes led from the Nile to the first pylon, which like the courtyard beyond is also free standing.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The courtyard is surrounded by six columns and eight statue pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to a peristyle court &quot;is decorated with colossal Osiris statues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; The rear portion of the building which is 43 m in depth was carved out of rock and follows the structure of Abu Simbel with a pillared hall featuring two rows of three statue pillars and, curiously, four statue recesses, each with divine triads along the sides.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beyond the hall lay the hall of the offering table and the barque chamber with four cult statues of Ptah, Ramesses, Ptah-Tatenen and Hathor carved out of the rock. During the building of the Aswan dam project in the 1960s, sections of the free-standing portion of this temple were dismantled and they have now been reconstructed at the site of [[New Kalabsha]]. Most of the rock cut temple was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters of the Nile.

'''Sais''' ({{lang-ar|صا الحجر}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Σάϊς|Σάϊς]]}}, {{lang-cop|ⲥⲁⲓ}}) or '''Sa El Hagar''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian town in the Western [[Nile Delta]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WebsterNinthNewCollege&quot;&gt;Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. &quot;Saïs.&quot; ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed. Springfield, MA: [[Merriam-Webster]] Inc., 1985. {{ISBN|0-87779-508-8}}, {{ISBN|0-87779-509-6}} (indexed), and {{ISBN|0-87779-510-X}} (deluxe).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the provincial capital of [[Sap-Meh]], the fifth [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]] and became the seat of power during the [[Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt]] (c. 732–720 BC) and the Saite [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]] (664–525 BC) during the [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;&gt;Ian Shaw &amp; Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, British Museum Press, 1995. p.250&lt;/ref&gt; Its Ancient Egyptian name was '''Zau'''.

==Overview==
{{Infobox hieroglyphs

|name = &lt;hiero&gt;z:G39-G1-G43-O49&lt;/hiero&gt;
|name transcription = Sau (Zau) &lt;br /&gt; ''Sꜣw (Zꜣw)''
|Greek = Σάϊς (Sais)

[[Herodotus]] wrote that Sais is where the grave of [[Osiris]] was located and that the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night on an adjacent lake.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, II, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's patron goddess was [[Neith]], whose cult is attested as early as the 1st Dynasty, ca. 3100- 3050 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;/&gt; The Greeks, such as Herodotus, [[Plato]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]], identified her with [[Athena]] and hence postulated a primordial link to [[Athens]]. Diodorus recounts that Athenians built Sais before the [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]]. While all Greek cities were destroyed during that cataclysm, including Athens, Sais and  the others Egyptian cities  survived.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA336,M1 ''Historical Library'' &quot;Book V, 57&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias]]'' (around 395 B.C., 200 years after the visit by the Greek legislator Solon), Sais is the city in which [[Solon]] (Solon visited Egypt in 590 B.C.) receives the story of [[Atlantis]], its military aggression against Greece and Egypt, its eventual defeat and destruction by gods-punishing catastrophe, from an Egyptian priest. Plato also notes the city as the birthplace of the [[pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''Timaeus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] said that the shrine of Athena, which he identifies with [[Isis]], in Sais carried the inscription ''&quot;I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be; and my [[Veil of Isis|veil]] no mortal has hitherto raised.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Isis.html Isis and Osiris]''&quot;, ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hector Berlioz]]' ''[[L'Enfance du Christ]]'' (The Childhood of Christ), in Part Three, has Sais as the setting for the youth of [[Jesus Christ]] until age 10, after his parents leave their homeland to escape [[Herod the Great]]'s [[Massacre of the innocents|massacre of male children]].

There are today no surviving traces of this town prior to the Late New Kingdom (c.1100 BC) due to the extensive destruction of the city by the ''[[Sebakh]]in'' (farmers removing mud brick deposits for use as fertilizer) leaving only a few relief blocks ''in situ''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw&quot;/&gt;

==Medical school==
The Temple of Sais had a medical school associated with it, as did many [[Egyptian temple|ancient Egyptian temples]]. The medical school at Sais had many female students and apparently women faculty as well, mainly in [[gynecology]] and [[obstetrics]]. An inscription from the period survives at Sais, and reads, &quot;I have come from the school of medicine at Heliopolis, and have studied at the woman's school at Sais, where the divine mothers have taught me how to cure diseases&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverthorne, Elizabeth and Geneva Fulgham|title=Women Pioneers in Texas Medicine|year=1997|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-0-89096-789-8|pages=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">'''Wadi Maghareh''' (also spelled '''Maghara''' or '''Magharah''', meaning &quot;'''The Valley of Caves'''&quot; in [[Egyptian Arabic]]), is an [[archaeological site]] located in the southwestern [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]]. It contains [[Pharaoh|pharaonic]] monuments and turquoise mines dating from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdoms]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The Ancient Egyptians knew the site as &quot;the Terraces of [[Turquoise]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mumford&quot;&gt;G. D. Mumford: &quot;''Wadi Maghara''&quot;, in Kathryn A. Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the Archeology of Ancient Egypt''(New York: Routledge, 1999), p. 875-876.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site was rediscovered in 1809 by [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]], and since then has seen several excavation teams, [[Richard Lepsius]]'s excavation in 1845 being the first. Major C. K. McDonald's visits to the site, including residence at the site from 1854-1866 (and an effort to mine turquoise there) resulted in only surface finds (arrowheads and such) with no further excavation;&lt;ref name=&quot;mumford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John D. Cooney, &quot;Major Macdonald, a Victorian Romantic,&quot; ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', Vol. 58, (Aug., 1972), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; a British [[Ordnance Survey]] of the site was made in 1868-1869, a Harvard University expedition in 1932, and several Israeli excavations between 1967 and 1982, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;mumford&quot;/&gt;

== Monuments, buildings and inscriptions ==
Ancient Egyptian monuments, buildings and inscriptions span the period from the Third to Twenty-Ninth Dynasties (ca. 2700 BC-1100 BC),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Bard and Shubert, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the Archeology of Ancient Egypt'', 876.&lt;/ref&gt; although most monuments date only to the Twelfth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;A. Barrois, &quot;The Mines of Sinai,&quot; ''The Harvard Theological Review,'' Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr., 1932), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Third Dynasty rock tables of king [[Sanakht]] are found in the valley, as is one of [[Djoser]] and two virtually identical tables of king [[Sekhemkhet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mumford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chromeyellow.blogspot.com/2010/12/wadi-maghara-sinai-1999.html|title=Chrome Yellow: Wadi Maghara Sinai 1999|last=A|first=Mr|date=2010-12-04|website=Chrome Yellow|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tables of [[Sneferu]] and [[Khufu]] from the Fourth Dynasty are also found there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lepsius&quot;/&gt; The Fifth Dynasty king [[Sahure]]'s funerary temple at [[Abusir]] has a relief representing him dispatching a fleet to the Red Sea, probably to collect turquoise at Maghareh.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''The Ancient History of the Near East from Earliest Times to the Battle of Salamis'', 3rd Ed., p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Sahure raised a monument depicting himself &quot;smiting the Mentju of all foreign lands&quot; which was found at Maghareh.

In addition to pharaonic monuments, an Old Kingdom settlement was founded on the summit of a hill in Wadi Igneh containing 125 rough stone structures containing wood ash and potsherds, some of which are of Nile Valley clay.&lt;ref name=&quot;mumford&quot;/&gt;

'''Karanis''' ({{lang-el|Καρανίς}}), located in modern Kom Aushim, was an agricultural town in Graeco-Roman [[Egypt]],
located in the northeast corner of the [[Al Fayyum|Fayum]].&lt;ref&gt;
Richard Alston, ''Soldier and Society in Roman Egypt'' (London: Routledge, 1998) 118&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;It was one of a number of towns established in the Arsinoite nome under [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] as part of a scheme to settle Greek mercenaries among the indigenous Egyptians and to exploit the potential fertile Fayum basin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Elaine K. Gazda, ed. ''Karanis: An Egyptian Town in Roman Times'' (Ann Arbor: [[Kelsey Museum of Archaeology]], University of Michigan, 1983) 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==South temple==
The earliest archaeological origins are at the South Temple
and can be traced to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;soldier&quot;&gt;Alston 119&lt;/ref&gt;
It is from this point that the town expanded north when [[Augustus]],
having conquered [[Egypt]] and also recognizing the Fayum’s agricultural potential,
sent workers to clean up the canals and restore the dikes that had fallen into decline, restoring productivity to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;karanis&quot;&gt;Gazda 9&lt;/ref&gt;
A Roman-style temple was then built on top of the foundations of the old temple
at the beginning of the 1st century AD.
During this period of rebuilding, a smaller, more Egyptian-style North Temple was also built.
The South Temple was dedicated to the local crocodile gods, Pnepheros and Petesouchos,
but there is no clear dedication in the North Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Alston 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions in the town==
The Fayum towns were settled by Roman veterans after Augustus conquered Egypt, though the small number of Latin papyri found in Karanis (only two) and the overwhelming number of Greek [[papyri]] from or concerning these veterans from this period suggest that these new soldiers may not have been culturally Roman but instead Greek, or at the very least from the Eastern empire.&lt;ref&gt;Alston 138&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The peace and political stability brought by Augustus and kept alive by his successors, meant prosperity for generations of landholders at Karanis well into the second century.

In the late second century, and again in the second quarter of the third, there were notable recessions that mirrored difficulties experienced by the Empire at large,&lt;ref name=&quot;karanis&quot;/&gt; houses had fallen down by the end of the 3rd century,&lt;ref name=&quot;soldier&quot;/&gt;
and the town was completely abandoned by the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt; Roger S. Bagnall and Naphtali Lewis, eds. ''Columbia Papyri VII'' (Ann Arbor: Scholars Press, 1979) 2&lt;/ref&gt; The dry conditions that Karanis was left in are most suitable for the preservation of papyri,&lt;ref&gt;Gazda 1&lt;/ref&gt; and it is for this that Karanis is most well known by archaeologists.

==Papyri==
[[Image:PLATE2.png|thumb|right|Letter from Terentianus to Tiberianus, Tiberianus given the military title of ''speculator''. Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Chayyim Youtie and John Garret Winter, eds. ''Michigan Papyri, Vol. VIII'' (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1951) 33&lt;/ref&gt;]][[Image:PLATE7.png|thumb|left|Letter from Prolemaeus, &quot;refers to a cult banquet in honor of [[Sarapis]]&quot; Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Youtie 142&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The papyri excavated are historically significant in that they come from the same place and time, all dating from the period between the reign of [[Diocletian]] and the 370s.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, with Karanis being a relatively poor town, the documents and artifacts excavated &quot;[provide] a microcosm of life as it was lived by ordinary people in Egypt under Greek and Roman rule,&quot; and provide evidence of the whole of Egypt’s relationship to the Empire of [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Gazda 6&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri contain mostly tax records, which is how archaeologists have determined that Karanis and its veterans were mostly poor, self-sufficient farmers who did not have much contact with other towns in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Alston 122&lt;/ref&gt;

These excavations were extremely troubled to say the least. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, farmers would “obtain permits to remove soil from the Karanis mound to use as fertilizer (''[[sebakh|sebbakh]]'')”, the organic decay making the soil very rich.

{{Grenfell and Hunt}}
The first real excavation was in 1895 by Englishmen [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Hunt|Arthur Surridge Hunt]],  though they felt the area had been too plundered to produce anything of much value. At this time, archaeology as a pursuit of knowledge was wholly unheard of, and papyri and other artifacts were treated more as items to collect. Also during this time (i.e., the late 19th and early 20th centuries), excavators were almost solely interested in artifacts dating to the older dynasties, and Graeco-Roman sites such as Karanis continued to be plundered for sebbakh until Francis W. Kelsey, a professor of Latin language and literature at the University of Michigan, observed this devastation and received grants to search for an excavation site in 1924. Starting excavations of Karanis in 1925, his goal was to &quot;increase exact knowledge rather than the amassing of collections&quot;, with a focus on common people.&lt;ref&gt;Gazda 2-5&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri collected are now part of the [[University of Michigan Papyrus Collection]]. More recent excavations have been done by the Cairo University, the French Institute, and for the last few years by a combined collaboration of UCLA and the University of Groningen (RUG) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Dunn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7220">'''Malkata''' (or '''Malqata'''), meaning ''the place where things are picked up'' in Arabic, is the site of an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian palace complex built during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], by the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]. It is located on the West Bank of the [[Nile River|Nile]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Upper Egypt]], in the desert to the south of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]]. The site also included a temple dedicated to Amenhotep III's [[Great Royal Wife]], [[Tiy]], and honors [[Sobek]], the crocodile deity.

[[Image:Malkata from the air.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The ruins of the Ancient Egyptian palace, Malkata; north is at the top.]]

==Palace of Amenhotep III==
[[File:Egyptian - &quot;Malqata Kateriskos&quot; Vessel - Walters 4732 - Profile.jpg|thumb|Polychrome glass vase from Malkata. [[Walters Art Museum]]. The city had an extensive glass industry, the first in Egypt]]
There are various structures in the desert, consisting of several residential palaces, a temple of [[Amun]], a festival hall, elite villas, houses for the relatives of the royal Family, apartments for attendants, and a desert altar termed the ''Kom al-Samak'', all of which were constructed by mud bricks.

The palace was built in the 14th century BC and its ancient name was ''[[Per (hieroglyph)|Per]]-Hay'', &quot;House of Rejoicing&quot;. &lt;!--copied as part of merge from [[Malqata]]--&gt;
Originally, the palace was known as ''the Palace of the Dazzling [[Aten]]''. Built mostly out of mud-brick, it was Amenhotep's residence throughout most the later part of his reign. Construction began around year 11 of his reign and continued until the king moved there permanently around his year 29. Once completed, it was the largest royal residence in Egypt.

To the east of the palace a large ceremonial lake was dug. The palace area was connected to the [[Nile]] through a system of canals, which end in a large harbour or quay, now called ''Birket Habu''.

===Layout of the palace===
The palace contained many audience halls, central halls, courtyards, villas, smaller palace complexes for the royal family, and apartments for officials. The harbor and canal connected the palace with the [[Nile]], allowing easy travel across the river to the city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], which was situated on the eastern bank. There is little evidence of this lake today and little but the foundations of the palace itself remain. 

The ''royal apartment'' featured a bedroom, a dressing room, a private audience chamber, and a harem, which, after the reign of [[Amenhotep III]], was used simply for storage. The palace had a central courtyard, and across from the pharaoh's rooms were apartments for his daughters and son. His Great Royal Wife, [[Tiye]], had her own smaller palace complex diagonally across from the pharaoh's. The palace grounds contained gardens and a large pleasure lake. 

Remains exist of a temple of [[Amun]] to the north of the palace, within the complex. A &quot;desert altar&quot; on the outskirts of the ruins has been excavated also. Remains of a temple to the goddess [[Isis]] lies south of the main palace complex.

Malqata was managed by a veritable army of servants and staff. Remains of kitchens near the royal chamber have been found, as well as servant quarters. The palace resembled a complete city, with officials in charge of different sections, such as the gardens and the different apartments and quarters.

===Palace decorations===
[[Image:Malkata wall painting remains.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Traces of wall painting on plastered mudbrick wall at Malkata]]
Fragments of plastered wall paintings have given archaeologists a glimpse of how the palace was decorated. Various paintings of the goddess [[Nekhbet]] made up the ceiling of the royal bedchamber. The walls were decorated with scenes of wildlife - flowers, reeds, and animals in the marshes, as well as decorative geometric designs, complete with rosettes. Ornate wooden columns painted to resemble lilies supported the ceilings. In the palace archaeologists also found some paintings of the great royal wife, [[Tiye]]. Rare traces of original wall paintings are still visible on site, despite the badly ruined state of the mudbrick walls.

===History of the palace===
The palace seems to have been begun by [[Amenhotep III]] in the early 14th century BC and the site was occupied as late as the [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman-Byzantine Period]]. Malqata was most definitely Amenhotep's main residence near Thebes, the capital of [[ancient Egypt]], and therefore, probably his main palace in all of the country. Remains of other smaller palaces in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and other cities throughout Egypt have been found, but none were as large as Amenhotep's palace at Malqata.

Malqata was abandoned by [[Akhenaten]], Amenhotep III's son and successor when he moved the capital to his new city at [[Amarna]], perhaps in order to break the  influence of the powerful priests of the [[Temple of Amun]]. However, it may have been re-inhabited by the youthful [[Tutankhamen]], when the traditional religion and capital were restored and the priests of the temple regained their influence in the interwoven religion and government of Ancient Egypt. 

Tutankhamen's successor, [[Ay]], probably inhabited the palace briefly, and pharaoh [[Horemheb]] after him as well, but by the ascension of [[Ramses II]], it was simply a minor residence, as the capital was moved to [[Pi-Ramesses]] in the far north.

===Excavations===
The palace ruins were &quot;rediscovered&quot; several times: in 1888 by [[Georges Émile Jules Daressy|Daressy]]; by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1910-1920; by University Museum of Pennsylvania in the 1970s; and since 1985, they have been the site of excavations by the Archaeological Mission of [[Waseda University]].

{{main|Deir el-Shelwit}}

===Temple of Isis===
Just south of the palace there is a temple devoted to [[Isis]] which was built in the Roman period. The modern name for this temple is ''Deir al-Shalwi''.

===Roman settlement and cemetery===
Excavations of the area by the Waseda team unearthed the remains of a Roman settlement and cemetery, finding remains from the times of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]].

==Malkata today==
Next to the site is a modern village. Here there is a tiny church and monastery dedicated to [[St Tawdros]].

Ancient '''Kellis''', now known as Ismant el-Kharab (Ismant the ruined), was a village in [[Upper Egypt]] during the Hellenistic, [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Period]], and Byzantine period. It was located about {{convert|2.5|km|mi|sp=us}} east-southeast of present-day Ismant in the [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhleh Oasis]], and about {{convert|11|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of Mut (more fully Mut el-Kharab), which is the capital of the oasis.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, G. and Aravecchia, Nicola. [http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/776189 &quot;Kellis&quot;], Pleiades (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, Mut was called Mothis, and thus Kellis was in the Mothite [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.monash.edu.au/archaeology/excavations/dakhleh/ismant-el-kharab/ &quot;Ismant el-Kharab, ancient Kellis&quot;], Monash University.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kellis 2004 (XXXIX) (4663351701).jpg|thumb|Ancient Kellis]]

==Structures==
The village was  {{convert|1050|m|ft|sp=us}} long and {{convert|650|m|ft|sp=us}} wide, built almost entirely of [[mud brick]] on a low [[Fluvial terrace|terrace]] with [[wadi]]s to the southeast and northwest, and surrounded by fields.&lt;ref&gt;Knudstad, J. E &amp; R.A. Frey 1999 Kellis, the Archaeological Survey of the Romano-Byzantine Town at Ismant el-Kharab, Reports from the Survey of the Dakhleh Oasis 1977-1987, C.S. Churcher and A.J. Mills eds, pages 95–96, Oxbow Books: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Small businesses included weaving, handcrafted pottery and blacksmithing. Attractions in Kellis included the Temple of [[Tutu (Egyptian god)|Tutu]] and three churches; the Small East Church is the oldest known [[Church_(building)|church building]] in Egypt. The site was occupied from the late [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Period]], was abandoned sometime after the year 392, and has remained unoccupied since then, except for a time in the 1940s, when some [[Bedouin]] camped there.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, A. 2002 Les parures des cartonnage des momies d’une nécrople d’Ismant el-Kharab, Dakhleh Oasis Project: Preliminary Reports on the 1994-1995 to 1998-1998 Field Seasons, C.A.

The tops of some are visible from the surface; others are hidden, waiting to collapse as an unwary tourist crosses.

==Excavation==
Archaeological exploration of Kellis began in 1986. Since 1991 the Kellis excavations have been funded by the [[Australian Research Council]], administered by [[Monash University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/egypt/xegycat.html |title=Egypt - Rare Books Exhibition |publisher=Lib.monash.edu.au |date=1998-10-02 |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211105347/http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/egypt/xegycat.html |archivedate=2010-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of writing fragments have been unearthed at Kellis, many pertaining to the ancient religion called [[Manichaeism]], whose adherents at Kellis apparently lived alongside Christians in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;Sami, Mariam. &quot;[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/04/news/mn-29121 Illuminating an Ancient Emissary of Light]&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (1998-10-04).&lt;/ref&gt;  Archeologists at Kellis have also found wooden books, glass vessels, tools, other domestic items, as well as cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dakhleh.com/kharab.htm &quot;Ismant el-Kharab, ancient Kellis&quot;], Dakhleh Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Ramesses II]], it was the location of a major fortress-town which probably marked the western extent of direct [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] influence.

It was discovered in 1948 and in the subsequent years was sporadically examined by [[Alan Rowe (archaeologist)|Alan Rowe]] and [[Labib Habachi]]. Since 1994 extensive excavations have been undertaken at the site by a team from the [[University of Liverpool]] under the direction of [[Steven Snape]].

== Pyramids ==

[[File:Bent Pyramid (I love Naples).jpg|thumb|left|Sneferu's [[Bent Pyramid]]]]
::Building the Dahshur pyramids was an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza; the last of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] still standing to this date. 

::The first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613 – 2589 BC), built under the rule of [[Sneferu|King Sneferu]], The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay) which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name “The Bent Pyramid”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Pyramid of Giza|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

::Realizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, [[Red Pyramid|the Red Pyramid]]. Once completed, the pyramid was considered to be a success, as it was a fully constructed, smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Pyramid|url=https://www.ancient.eu/image/5732/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Red Pyramid’s name reigns from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. And this pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic: Egypt--North Pyramid of Snefru, Dahshur|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/north.html|website=www.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Shortly after King Sneferu’s death a third pyramid was erected by his son [[Khufu]]. Khufu wanting to build a legacy of his own, utilized his father’s research to design and guide the building process of the third pyramid to completion (2589-2566 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giza Timeline - Ancient History Encyclopedia|url=https://www.ancient.eu/timeline/giza/|website=www.ancient.eu|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Once completed the pyramid was named [[Great Pyramid of Giza|The Great Pyramid of Giza]], and it stands an astonishing 481 feet (147 meters) tall with an angle of 52 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parra|first1=Jose|title=Standing Tall: Egypt’s Great Pyramids|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/01-02/egypt-great-pyramids-giza-plateau/|website=National Geographic|publisher=History Magazine|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Another pyramid located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty [[Amenemhat II|King Amenemhat II]] (1929 – 1895 BCE). This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it (sand on the outside and limestone on the inside). Naturally the weather caused the sand to erode from it, but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12th - and 13th-Dynasty Pyramids|url=http://www.worldhistory.biz/ancient-history/55779-7-6-12th-and-13th-dynasty-pyramids.html|website=World history|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[Senusret III|King Senusret III]] (1878 – 1839 BCE) had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses; [[Sithathor|Sit-Hathor]] and Merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12th - and 13th-Dynasty Pyramids|url=http://www.worldhistory.biz/ancient-history/55779-7-6-12th-and-13th-dynasty-pyramids.html|website=World history|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[Pyramid of Amenemhat III (Dahshur)|The Black Pyramid]] dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. 

::Several other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri who was the archaeologist whom excavated this site.

== Tombs &amp; Cemeteries ==

Located closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king's daughters ([[Sithathor]]). Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur's pyramids. Dahshur was Egypt's royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.

==Contemporary history==
In July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 100 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence.  The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death. This, in turn, sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act.  At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riot leaves christians&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/riot-leaves-egyptian-village-christians-16930420 | title=Riot leaves an Egyptian village without Christians | publisher=ABC News | work=Associated Press | date=August 4, 2012 | accessdate=August 5, 2012 | author=El Deeb, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2013, and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|2011 uprising]], the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Longer a Sacred Site&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/1061/17/No-longer-a-sacred-site.aspx | title=No Longer Sacred | publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly | work=Al-Ahram | date=January 16, 2013 | accessdate=January 18, 2013 | author=El-Aref, Nevine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Dahshur has a [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] climate (BWh) according to the [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]].

'''Islamic Cairo''' ({{lang-ar|قاهرة المعز}}, ''Qahirat al-Maez'') is a part of central [[Cairo]] around the old [[Fatimid architecture#Cairo fortifications|walled]] city and around the [[Citadel of Cairo]] which is characterized by hundreds of [[mosques]], tombs, [[madrasas]], mansions, [[caravanserais]], and fortifications dating from the [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Islamic era]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) proclaimed ''Historic Cairo'' a [[World Heritage Site|World Cultural Heritage site]], as &quot;one of the world's oldest Islamic cities, with its famous mosques, madrasas, hammams and fountains&quot; and &quot;the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/89 ''Decision Text''], World Heritage Centre, retrieved 21 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Suhaymi033.JPG|thumb|left|A typical House with [[Mashrabiya]] in Islamic Cairo.]]
[[File:Medieval map of Cairo.png|thumb|Map of Medieval Cairo]]

[[Egypt]] was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquered]] by [[Arab]] Muslims under [['Amr ibn al-'As]] in 641. [[Alexandria]] was then the capital of Egypt. However, even though the Arabs admired Alexandria's glamor and wealth, they chose to establish a new capital on the east bank of the [[Nile]]. That site would not be separated by water from [[Medina]], then the residence of the [[Caliph]]. Here, the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|'Amr ibn al-'As Mosque]] was built, the first mosque in Africa. Later rulers added many additional mosques and palaces in the area around 'Amr Mosque.

Islamic Cairo, also referred to as Medieval Cairo or Fatimid Cairo, was founded in 969 as the royal enclosure for the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliphs, while the actual economic and administrative capital was in nearby [[Fustat]]. Fustat was established by 'Amr ibn al-'As following the conquest of Egypt.  [[Al-Askar]], located in what is now [[Old Cairo]], was the capital of Egypt from 750 to 868.  [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] established [[al-Qata'i]] as the new capital of Egypt, and it remained the capital until 905, when the Fustat once again became the capital. After Fustat was destroyed in 1168/9 to prevent its capture by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], the administrative capital of Egypt moved to [[Cairo]], where it has remained ever since. It took four years for the general [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]] (the Sicilian) to build Cairo and for the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Muizz]] to leave his old capital [[Mahdia]] in Tunisia and settle in the new Fatimid capital in Egypt.

After [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]], [[Giza]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fortress of [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon-in-Egypt]], Fustat was a new city built as a military garrison for Arab troops. It was the closest central location to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] that was accessible to the [[Nile River|Nile]]. Fustat became a regional center of [[Islam]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] period. It was where the Umayyad ruler, [[Marwan II]], made his last stand against the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]].

Later, during the Fatimid era, Al-Qahira (Cairo) was officially founded in 969 as an imperial capital just to the north of Fustat. Over the centuries, Cairo grew to absorb other local cities such as Fustat, but the year 969 is considered the &quot;founding year&quot; of the modern city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196905/cairo-a.millennial.htm|title=Cairo, a Millennial|accessdate=2007-08-09|author=Irene Beeson|pages=24, 26–30 |date=September–October 1969|publisher=[[Saudi Aramco World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1250, the slave soldiers or [[Mamluk]]s seized Egypt and ruled from their capital at Cairo until 1517, when they were defeated by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. By the 16th century, Cairo had [[high-rise]] [[apartment building]]s where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[Renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0-7007-1700-5|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s French army briefly occupied Egypt from 1798 to 1801, after which an Albanian officer in the Ottoman army named [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] made Cairo the capital of an independent empire that lasted from 1805 to 1882. The city then came under British control until Egypt [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|was granted its independence]] in 1922.

==Notable sites==
[[File:Kairo_Ibn_Tulun_Moschee_BW_5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ibn Tulun Mosque]].]]
While the first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat, the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] is the oldest mosque to retain its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture, from the [[Islamic Golden Age|classical period of Islamic civilization]]. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of [[Samarra]] in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, pp. 50–54.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Cairo was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army, the Fatimids built a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the [[vizir]] [[Badr al-Jamali|Badr al-Gamali]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, André. 1993. ''Le Caire''. Fayard, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which survive today at [[Bab Zuwayla]] in the south and [[Bab al-Futuh]] and [[Bab al-Nasr (Cairo)|Bab al-Nasr]] in the north.

One of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|Mosque of al-Azhar]], founded in 970 AD, which competes with the [[Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fes]] for the title of oldest university in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Caroline p. 169&quot;&gt;Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[al-Azhar University]] is the foremost center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Caroline p. 169&quot;/&gt; The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans [[Qaitbay]] and [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|al-Ghuri]] and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.

Other extant monuments from the Fatimid era include the large [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Mosque of al-Hakim]], the [[Al-aqmar mosque|al-Aqmar mosque]], [[Juyushi Mosque]], [[Lulua Mosque]], and the [[Salih Talai Mosque|Mosque of Salih Tala'i]].

The most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk period]], from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, [[khanqah]] (for [[Sufis]]), water distribution centers (sabils), and mausoleum for themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. ''Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture''. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan]], the [[Mosque of Amir al-Maridani]], the [[Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad|Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad]] (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of [[Bab Zuwayla]]), the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|Sultan Al-Ghuri complex]], the [[Complex of Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay|funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay]] in the [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|Northern Cemetery]], and the trio of monuments in the [[Bayn al-Qasrayn]] area comprising the [[Qalawun complex|complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun]], the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad|Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad]], and the [[Madrasa of Sultan Barquq]]. It is said that a lot of the columns found in mosques were taken from the Coptic churches because of their beautiful artistic carvings and placed in mosques.
[[File:Khan elkhaleely haddara.jpg|thumb|[[Khan el-Khalili]], a major souk in Islamic Cairo.]]
The Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond, André 1993. pp. 90-97&quot;&gt;Raymond, André. 1993. ''Le Caire''. Fayard, pp. 90–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which nowadays also hosts regular performances by the Al-[[Tannoura]] Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. ''Lonely Planet: Egypt'' (11th edition), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Khan al-Khalili (see below) is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).

Islamic Cairo is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the [[al-Hussein Mosque]] (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]), the Mausoleum of Imam [[al-Shafi'i]] (founder of the [[Shafi'i]] [[madhhab]], one of the primary schools of thought in [[Sunni]] Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]), the [[Mashhad of Sayyida Ruqayya|Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya]], the [[Al-Sayeda Nafeesah Mosque|Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa]], and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Williams, Caroline. 2008 (6th ed.). ''Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation status==
Much of this historic area suffers from neglect and decay, in this, one of the poorest and most overcrowded areas of the Egyptian capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-596/i.html ''Ancient Cairo: Preserving a Historical Heritage''], Qantara, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, as reported in the [[Al-Ahram Weekly]], thefts at Islamic monuments inside the Darb Al-Ahmar threaten their long-term preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/903/eg8.htm ''Unholy Thefts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605095335/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/903/eg8.htm |date=2013-06-05 }} Al-Ahram Weekly, Nevine El-Aref, 26 June - 2 July 2008 Issue No. 903.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edfu''' ({{lang-arz|إدفو}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|ˈʔedfu|pron}}, {{Lang-cop|Ⲧⲃⲱ vars. Ⲁⲧⲃⲱ, Ⲧⲃⲟ (Sahidic); Ⲑⲃⲱ(Bohairic)}}; also spelt '''Idfu''', or in modern French as '''Edfou''', and known in antiquity as '''Behdet''') is an [[Egypt]]ian [[list of Egyptian cities|city]], located on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] between [[Esna]] and [[Aswan]], with a population of approximately sixty thousand people. For the ancient history of the city, see [[#Apollonopolis Magna|below]]. Edfu is the site of the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] ''Temple of Horus'' and an ancient settlement, ''Tell Edfu'' (described below). About {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Edfu are remains of ancient pyramids.

== Temple of Horus ==
[[File:Street in Edfu.jpg|thumb|160px|Street in Edfu]]
{{Main|Temple of Edfu}}
The town is known for the major [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] temple, built between 237 BC and 57 BC, into the reign of [[Cleopatra VII]]. Of all the temple remains in [[Egypt]], the Temple of [[Horus]] at Edfu is the most completely preserved. Built from sandstone blocks, the huge Ptolemaic temple was constructed over the site of a smaller [[New Kingdom]] temple, oriented east to west, facing towards the river. The later structure faces north to south and leaves the ruined remains of the older temple [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] to be seen on the east side of the first court.

[[File:Village d’Edfou, vue prise du Pylone du Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Village d’Edfou, vue prise du Pylone du Temple]]
The remains of the ancient settlement of Edfu  are situated about 50 m to the west of the Ptolemaic temple  - to the left of the older temple [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. This settlement  is known as ''Wetjeset-hor'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name was ''Apollinopolis Magna'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ''Apollinòpolis'', ''Απολλινόπολις''). According to ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', part of [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II ''Traiana Fortis'']] was camped in ''Apollo superior'', which was the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name for the town.

Although unassuming and unglamorous to the visiting tourists, Tell Edfu is a monument that contains evidence of more Egyptian history and is of more archaeological interest than the Ptolemaic temple. Although major parts of the settlement show severe signs of erosion, cut away or have been exposed during [[sebakh]]-digging, enough is preserved to gain information from as far back as the [[Predynastic Period]]. The remains of the settlement (tell) provides an insight into the development of Edfu as a provincial town from the end of the Old Kingdom until the Byzantine period. The settlement at Edfu was the capital of the Second Upper Egypt nome, and played an important role within the region. The oldest part of the town which can be dated to the late Old Kingdom lies on the eastern part of the tell, not far from the Ptolemaic temple.
There is evidence that the town flourished during the First Intermediate Period when it expanded extensively to the west. Interestingly, it is one of few settlements in southern Egypt that throve when it seems that the north, especially around the delta, was in economic decline.
[[File:S F-E-CAMERON 2006-10-EGYPT-EDFU-0059.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Statue of Horus, Edfu Temple.]]
Today, the ancient mound of Tell Edfu is preserved in some areas up to 20 m high and contains complete archaeological sequences of occupation dating to the Old Kingdom until the Graeco-Roman period, more than 3000 years of history, therefore providing ideal conditions to study the development of a provincial town.  A central part of the site was explored by Henri Henne from the Institute for Egyptology in Lille in 1921 and 1922. His team identified the remains of a small sanctuary from the Late or Ptolemaic period, possibly the Osiris chapel built by Psamtek I. Henne was followed by Octave Guéraud in 1928 then by Maurice Alliot in 1931 who each explored and excavated different aspects of the settlement remains.  The top layers of the settlement containing the Byzantine, Roman and Ptolemaic remains and the  Old and Middle Kingdom cemetery at the southern western corner were recorded by a Franco-Polish mission in 1937-39, directed by B. Bruyère, J. Manteuffel and [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], and three elaborate reports on the archaeology of Tell Edfu were published. 
&lt;!-- B. Bruyère, J. Manteuffel, K. Michałowski, J. Sainte Fare Garnot, Tell Edfou 1937. Fouilles franco-polonaises.  Rapports I, Le Caire 1937, p.&amp;nbsp;102, No. 4, pl. XVI, 1  Fouilles Franco-Polonaise, Rapports II, Tell Edfou 1938, Le Caire; Fouilles Franco-Polonaise, Rapports II, Tell Edfou 1938, Le Caire. --&gt;
Unfortunately, since mid-1939 no new detailed discoveries or thorough research has been completed at the tell except for 
recent work done by Barry Kemp, from the University of Cambridge. Since 2001, the Tell Edfu project has been directed by Nadine Moeller (Oriental Institute, University of Chicago). The current work focuses on the eastern part of the site. So far the administrative centre of the ancient town has been discovered with remains of a columned hall dating to the late Middle Kingdom as well as a large granary courtyard that functioned as a grain reserve for this provincial capital. Latter dates to the Second Intermediate Period (17th Dynasty). At least seven large round silos have been excavated here with a diameter between 5.5 and 6.5 meters which makes them the largest ones so far discovered within an ancient Egyptian urban centre.
[[File:S F-E-CAMERON 2006-10-EGYPT-EDFU-0020.JPG|thumb|left|225px|The first [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at Edfu Temple.]]
No larger remains dating earlier than the 5th Dynasty have been found at Edfu. The ancient cemetery comprised [[Mastaba|mastabas]] of the Old Kingdom as well as later tombs. Before the beginning of the New Kingdom, the necropolis was transferred to Hager Edfu, to the west and then in the Late period to the south at Nag’ el-Hassaya. The entire area was called Behedet. The god Horus was herein worshipped as Horus Behedet.

One of these mastabas belonged to Isi, a local administrator, who, it was quoted was the &quot;great chief of the Nome of Edfu&quot; in the  Sixth Dynasty. Isi lived during the reign of King Djedkare Isesi of the Fifth and into the reign of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasties. He was an administrator, judge, chief of the royal archives and a &quot;Great One among the Tens of the South&quot; [ref?]. Isi later became a living god and was so worshipped during the Middle Kingdom. As the Sixth Dynasty and the Old Kingdom drew to a close, local regional governors and administrative nobles took on a larger power in their areas, away from the royal central authority.

== Pyramid ruins ==
The remains of one of seven small provincial step pyramids built along the Nile Valley, is situated about 5&amp;nbsp;km south of Edfu near the west bank village of '''Naga el-Goneima'''. The structure was built from rough reddish sandstone and rises to a present height of 5.5 m. The pyramid has been loosely attributed to King [[Huni]] of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]]. The purpose of these pyramids is unknown. Further investigations and a detailed survey are carried out by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago since 2010.

== Apollonopolis Magna ==
In the [[Hellenistic period]] and under the [[Roman Empire]], the city was known as '''Apollonopolis Magna''' or '''Apollinopolis Magna''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|πόλις μεγάλη Ἀπόλλωνος}}, [[Strabo]] xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;817; Agartharch. p.&amp;nbsp;22; [[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] v. 9. s. 11; [[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Is. et Osir.'' 50; Aelian. ''Hist. An.'' x. 2; [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] iv. 5. § 70; {{lang|grc|Ἀπολλωνία}}, [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. Byzant.]] ''s. v.''; {{lang|grc|Ἀπολλωνιάς}}, [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocl.]] p.&amp;nbsp;732; [[Antonine Itinerary|It. Ant.]] p.&amp;nbsp;160, 174; Not. Imp. Orient. c. 143; [[Latin]]: Apollonos Superioris [urbs]). Ptolemy assigns Apollinopolis to the [[Hermonthite nome]], but it was more commonly regarded as the capital town of the [[Apollopolite nome|nome Apollopolites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SmithDGRG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Roman Empire|Roman emperors]] it was the headquarters of the [[Legio II Traiana Fortis|Legio II Trajana]]. Its inhabitants were enemies of the crocodile and its worshippers.

The ancient city derived its principal reputation from two temples, which are considered second only to the Temple of [[Dendera]] as specimens of the sacred structures of Egypt. The [[Temple of Edfu|larger temple]] is in good preservation, and is being excavated. The smaller temple, sometimes, but improperly, called a Typhonium, is apparently an appendage of the former, and its sculptures represent the birth and education of the youthful deity, [[Horus]], whose parents [[Noum]], or [[Kneph]] and [[Hathor|Athor]], were worshipped in the larger edifice. The principal temple is dedicated to Noum, whose symbol is the disc of the sun, supported by two asps and the extended wings of a vulture. Its sculptures represent (Rosellini, ''Monum. del Culto'', p.&amp;nbsp;240, tav. xxxviii.) the progress of the Sun, Phre-Hor-Hat, Lord of Heaven, moving in his bark (Bari) through the circle of the Hours. The local name of the district round Apollinopolis was ''Hat'', and Noum was styled Hor-hat-kah, or Horus, the tutelary genius of the land of Hat. This deity forms also at Apollinopolis a triad with the goddess Athor and [[Hor-Senet]]. The members of the triad are youthful gods, pointing their finger towards their mouths, and before the decipherment of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] were regarded as figures of Harpocrates.

The entrance into the larger temple of Apollinopolis is a gateway (πυλών) 50 feet high, flanked by two converging wings (πτερά) in the form of truncated pyramids, rising to {{convert|107|ft|m}}. The wings contain ten stories, are pierced by round loop-holes for the admission of light, and probably served as chambers or dormitories for the priests and servitors of the temple. From the jambs of the door project two blocks of stone, which were intended, as Ddnon supposes, to support the heads of two colossal figures. This propylaeon leads into a large square, surrounded by a colonnade roofed with squared granite, and on the opposite side is a pronaos or portico, {{convert|53|ft|m}} in height, and having a triple row of columns, six in each row, with variously and gracefully foliaged capitals. The temple is {{convert|145|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|424|ft|m}} long from the entrance to the opposite end. Every part of the walls is covered with hieroglyphics, and the main court ascends gradually to the pronaos by broad steps. The whole area of the building was surrounded by a wall {{convert|20|ft|m}} high, of great thickness. Like so many of the Egyptian temples, that of Apollinopolis was capable of being employed as a fortress. It stood about a third of a mile from the river. The sculptures, although carefully and indeed beautifully executed, are of the [[Ptolemies|Ptolemaic era]], the earliest portion of the temple having been erected by [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] in 181 BC.

Apollonopolis Magna became a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Ptolemais Hermiou|Ptolemais]], the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Thebaid|Thebais Secunda]]. Papyrus documents record the names of perhaps five of its bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Klaas A. Worp, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/8214/5_039_223.pdf?sequence=1 ''A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750)''], in ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 100 (1994) 283-318&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential bishopric, Apollonopolis Magna is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 835&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predynastic mummies===
{{Main article|Gebelein predynastic mummies}}
The Gebelein predynastic mummies are six naturally mummified bodies, dating to approximately 3400 BC from the Late Predynastic period of Egypt, and were the first complete pre-dynastic bodies to be discovered. The well-preserved bodies were excavated at the end of the nineteenth century by Wallis Budge, the British Museum Keeper for Egyptology, from shallow sand graves near Gebelein (modern name Naga el-Gherira) in the Egyptian desert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budge&quot;/&gt;

A Pre-dynastic mummified body dated to 3400 BC, excavated from this site, has been on display in the British Museum since 1901.&lt;ref name=gu1987&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=October 14, 1987|title=Ancient Egyptian given new lease of life: Maev Kennedy goes down among the dead men at the British Museum to see a mummy made up|author=Maev Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple of Hathor===
The site includes the remains from a temple to [[Hathor]] with a number of [[cartouches]] on mud bricks and a royal [[stela]] from the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second]] to [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third]] Dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;&gt;Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind. ''Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings, V Upper Egypt: Sites (Volume 5)''. Griffith Institute. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple is located on the east hill of the site. Items of several [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] rulers include  a stele of [[Dedumose II]], a block of [[Djedankhre Montemsaf]], and a stela of a ruler named Sekhemtawy. [[Hyksos]] rulers mentioned are [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] (on a lintel) and [[Khyan]] (on a black granite block).&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

Later period finds include a brick naming the [[High Priest of Amun]] [[Menkheperre]] and his wife Isetemkheb. The brick likely came from the Fort that enclosed the temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;
From the Ptolemaic period came fragments of a statue of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II]] Limestone fragments from the shrine that would have held the statue were also found.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

===Ptolemaic period military camp===
During the reign of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]], a military camp was established at Gebelein after the Theban rebellion of 186 B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;&gt;J. G. Manning, Land and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: The Structure of Land Tenure, Cambridge University Press, May 29, 2003 (Via Google books)&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was destroyed by rebel forces 88 BC and the site was never again inhabited on a larger scale. Several hundred Demotic and Greek papyri and [[ostraca]] pertaining to the soldiers and the local temple were found at the ruins between 1890 and 1930. These including the archive of the mercenary [[Horos son of Nechoutes]] and a cavalry officer named Dryton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;/&gt;

'''Saint Catherine''' (also spelled: '''''St. Katrine'''''&lt;span style=&quot;margin:2.5px;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; {{lang-arz|سانت كاترين}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|ˈsænte kætˈɾiːn|pron}}) is a city in the [[South Sinai Governorate]]. It is located at the outskirts of [[El Tur]] Mountains at an elevation of {{convert|1586|m|ft|abbr=on}}, {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} away from [[Nuweiba]], at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] and the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]. Its population is 4,603 (1994).

==History==

===Pharaonic era===
Although Saint Catherine was not established as a city at that time, it was always part of the [[Egyptian Empire]] throughout history and it was part of the province of &quot;Deshret Reithu&quot;.

In the 16th century BC, the Egyptian [[pharaohs]] built the way of Shur across [[Sinai]] to Beersheba and on to Jerusalem. The region provided the Egyptian Empire with turquoise, gold and copper, and well preserved ruins of mines and temples are found not far from Saint Catherine at [[Serabit el-Khadim]] and [[Wadi Mukattab]], the Valley of Inscription. They include temples from the 12th Dynasty, dedicated to [[Hathor]], goddess of love, music and beauty, and from the [[New Kingdom]] dedicated to [[Sopdu]], the god of the [[Eastern Desert]].
[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]

===Roman and Byzantine era===
Located at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]], [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] was the start of the city, it was constructed by order of the [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] between 527 and 565.

==Modern township==
Saint Catherine City is one of the newest townships in Egypt, with all amenities of a modern place: there are several schools, including a high school, a hospital, police and fire brigade, a range of hotels, post office, telephone center, bank and all other important establishments.

The township's oldest settlement is Wadi El Sybaiya, east of the city's monastery, where the Roman soldiers, whose descendants the Jebeliya are, were accommodated. It started growing into a town after the tarmac road was completed in the 1980s and the tourist trade begun. Many of the nomad [[Bedouin|Bedouins]] moved to small settlements around the city's monastery, which collectively make up St. Katherine's Town. The districts of [[El Milga]], [[Shamiya]], Raha and Nabi Harun form the core of the town -Saint Katherine's downtown, at the end of the tarmac road where the valleys of Wadi El Arbain (Wadi El Lega), Wadi Quez, Wadi Raha, Wadi Shrayj and Wadi El Dier connect to the main valley, Wadi Sheikh. There are settlements in Wadi Sheikh before town and other smaller ones in the valleys.

Saint Catherine is the capital of the Municipality of Saint Katherine, which includes these outlying areas as well. The town's monastery lies in Wadi el Deir, opposite Wadi Raha (Wadi Muka’das, the Holy Valley). Mount Sinai can be reached from the monastery or, alternatively, from Wadi El Arbain where the Rock of Moses (Hagar Musa) and the Monastery of the Forty Martyrs are.

The highest mountains ranges in [[Egypt]] surround the town with many smaller valleys leading from the basin to the mountains in all directions. The township is at an elevation of {{convert|1600|m}}. The high altitude of the town itself and the high ranges of mountains which embrace it provide a pleasant climate, with refreshing mild [[summer]] nights and excellent spring, while [[winter]] days are relatively cool for the region and the nights can get very cold on rare occasions, making it sometimes necessary to heat buildings and public places.

Infrequent snowfalls in Saint Catherine take place during the winter months of December, January and February, however snow has also occurred in late autumn and early spring.

Saint Catherine Town lies at the foot of the [[Sinai high mountain region]], the &quot;[[Roof of Egypt]]&quot;, where Egypt's highest mountains are found. Some trekking groups however prefer especially the winter season as they find it more interesting and lovely to hike and climb in these conditions.

The town also puts a great pressure on the water resources, as ground water in the valley is from the mountains. Today water has to be purchased and brought in by trucks. As of September 28, 2011, water from the [[Nile]] is being transported to Saint Catherine via a pipe line, built with the help of the European Union.

==Religion==
Saint Catherine is in a region holy to the world's three major Abrahamic religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. It is a place where Moses is believed to  have received the Ten Commandments; a place where early Christianity has flourished and the Orthodox monastic tradition still continues in present day; a place which the [[prophet Mohammed]] took under his protection in his [[Achtiname of Muhammad|Letter to the Monks]] and where people still live in respect to others. Many events recorded in the Bible took place in the area, and there are hundreds of places of religious importance in the city. There are two ancient churches, and the Monastery of St. Katherine and the Rock of Moses.

==Culture and population==
The traditional people of the area, the [[Jebeliya Bedouin]], are a unique people having been brought from south-eastern Europe in the 6th century AD. Originally Christians, they soon converted to Islam and intermarried with other nomad tribes. Some segments of the tribe arrived relatively recently from the Arabian Peninsula. Their culture is very similar to other Bedouin groups, but they preserved some unique features. Contrary to other Bedouin tribes, the Jebeliya have always been practicing agriculture and are expert gardeners which is very evident in the wadis around Saint Katherine. They have lived and still live in a symbiotic relationship with the monastery and its monks, and even today many Bedouin work with the monastery on its compound or in one of its gardens.
There are also [[Egyptians]] who live there and work in governmental and public services and many Egyptians became aware of the importance of that unique, beautiful, snowy city and started to be in close relation with it.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}
[[Greeks]] and [[Russians]] are also citizens of Saint Catherine city and they control the historic monastery.
The chilly cold weather of the city, specifically in winter nights, made people used to stay at heated homes early, and keen on growing plants which could produce liquids to warm themselves.
The Jebeliya are skilled gardeners and craftsmen who have been building gardens, houses, store rooms, water dams and other structures in the mountains for centuries.

The techniques used are very similar to the [[Byzantine]] methods, partly because of the natural environment, partly because of the interaction between the Bedouin and the Monastery. In fact, they have received seeds from the monks to start crops. They grow vegetables and fruit in stone walled gardens called bustan or karm, and mastered grafting where a branch of a better yielding low land variety is planted on a more resistant but low yielding mountain variety.

A variety of species of plants and crops grow here, such as [[almond]], because of the moderate climate. Other fruits include [[apple]], [[pear]], [[apricot]], [[peach]], [[ficus|fig]], [[pistachio]], [[date (fruit)|date]]s and [[grapes]]. [[Walnut]] is rare but grown at a few locations. [[Mulberry]] grows wild in some of the wadis and they belong to the whole tribe. Wild figs, tasty but small, grow in many places. [[Olives]] are very important, found in many location names. Vegetables are not grown to the extent as in the past because of less water. [[Flowers]] and medicinal [[herbs]] are grown everywhere.
The gardens are usually built in the wadi floors in the main water course, and are encircled by massive stone walls. These walls have to withstand the regular flash floods, retain the soil - thus called retaining wall - and protect the garden from animals. Water wells are either built in the garden or a number of gardens have one but these wells freeze in winter and sometimes in spring and autumn. Today usually generators pump the water, but you can still see many [[shadoof]]s. Water is often found at higher elevations, either in natural springs or in wells made at dykes called jidda. The Bedouin built small dams and closed off canyons to make reservoirs. In either case water is channelled to small rock pools called birka, from where it was available for irrigation. Water was flown in narrow conduits made of flat rocks sometimes for kilometers - they are still visible but today gardens rely on plastic pipes (khartoom). These gardens are a unique feature of the high mountain area, along with other stone and rock structures.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Saint Katherine 53 Almond.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Almond flower covered in snow]] --&gt;
Bedouin houses are simple and small stone structures with cane roofing, either incorporated in the garden wall, or standing alone a bit further up from the wadi floor, away from the devastating flash floods that sweep through after occasional heavy rains. Houses are often built next to huge boulders; natural cracks and holes in it are used as shelves and candle holders.
Smaller rock shelters and store rooms are constructed under boulders and in walled up caves, and are found everywhere in the mountainous area. Some of them are well visible landmarks, such as in Abu Seila or [[Farsh Rummana]], but most hard to distinguish from the landscape.
You can see ancient leopard traps in many places, either under boulders such as in Wadi Talaa, or standing alone as on the top of Abu Geefa. A goat was placed in as a bait, and the entrance was slammed closed with a big rock when the leopard entered. There are no more [[leopards]] left in Sinai; the last was spotted in the 1980s.
In many places you can see big boulders with oval marks engraved on the surface. They are marriage proposal rocks, where a lover drew a line around his foot on the rock face next to his lover's foot print. If the two marks are encircled, their wish was granted and they got married.
Wishing rocks are boulders, usually a short distance from the main paths, with a flat top: if you throw a pebble and it stays on the top, your wish will come true.

===Planned growth===
{{update section|date=April 2017}}
According to the governmental plans, the population of the city is expected to increase from 4,603 to 17,378 in 2017. The increasing numbers of Egyptians living there, and visiting the city will succeed in accomplishing that developmental national plan. 3,031 (75.1%) of Saint Catherine's population is formed of Jebeliya Bedouins, while the rest are Egyptians, Greeks, Russians and western Europeans. Assuming a natural growth rate of 3% to the year 2017, the Bedouin population would become a minority in Saint Catherine, dropping to 36% of the total population if Ministry of Planning targets are achieved.

==Nature==
The city of Saint Catherine and other close towns fall within the region of [[Saint Katherine Protectorate]], which was established in 1988.
It is a unique high altitude eco-system with many endemic and rare species, including the world's smallest butterfly (the [[Sinai baton blue butterfly]]), flocks of shy [[Nubian ibex]], and hundreds of different plants of medicinal value. The region has been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Area. Some of the species are endangered, but there are many wild animals, birds, flowers to see. There are many Sinai agamas, foxes, and rock hyraxes. Harmless for people, foxes regularly visit the town at night to steal and scavenge. Rock hyraxes are frequenting gardens, and there is a wide range of migrating and resident birds from Europe. Also, there is a large number of feral donkeys in the mountains who migrate to the region and lower lying areas (reportedly as far as [[El Tur]]) in the winter and go back to graze for the more plentiful summer. Many of them belong to families and are stamped with marks. However, they put a big pressure on the eco-system and there is a move to reduce their numbers by the Saint Katherine City Council.

One of the principal goals of the Protectorate is to preserve the bio-diversity of the fragile eco-system, with an emphasis on the Nubian ibex and the wild medicinal and aromatic plants. The St. Katherine Protectorate is another major job provider in the area, although the number of local Bedouins employed fell back sharply since the initial [[European Union]] support ended, according to local sources.

Snow is the best source of water as it melts slowly, thus releasing water at a steady pace, replenishing the underwater catchment areas better. Water from rains flows down fast in the barren mountains, which may cause flash-floods and less water remains.

The views from the highest mountains in [[Egypt]] are extensive, and there are many other natural sights in the wadi system.There are springs, creeks, water pools, narrow canyons, steep wadis with large boulders, rock formations, and barren plains with islands of vegetation. On the top of the mountains there are many interconnected basins with a unique high altitude ecosystem,{{fact|date=December 2017}} home to the world's smallest butterfly and other rare plant species.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The highest mountain in Egypt is [[Mount Katherine]], and there are many other peaks in the area over {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}. Mount Katherine can be reached via Wadi El Arbain or Wadi Shag, either way a full day. Usually the trek makes a circle, with sleeping at the top. There is a small orthodox chapel at the top. The Monastery constructed a small stone hut where trekkers and pilgrims can stay for overnight in the harshly cold weather. There is usually a candle and matches in case one forgets, but one can also leave some if they have too many. There is also a broom and rubbish bins, and people are expected to clean up after themselves. From the peak there are views over [[Mount Sinai]] (Jebel Musa), and on a clear day one can see as far as [[Sharm el Sheikh]] and the [[Red Sea]].
Jebel Abbas Basha is another popular peak; from here one can see the villages and the city as well as the rest of the high mountains. It can be reached in one day, but if one wants to stay for the sunset, it is better to make it in two days, either sleeping on the top or in Wadi Zawatin or Wadi Tinya at the base of the mountain.

A little further is Jebel el Bab, which could be visited in two long days, but better included in a 3–4 days trek visiting other places as well. On the way up from Wadi Jebal you pass Ras Abu Alda, a rock formation resembling the head of a mountain goat, from where there are views to [[Mount Umm Shomar]], another popular peak even further, and the southern ranges. From the peaks of Jebel el Bab and Bab el Donya you are looking over [[Mount Tarbush]] and can see [[El Tur]] and the [[Gulf of Suez]]. Under the peaks is the spring of Ain Nagila.
Other popular peaks in the area include Jebel Ahmar, [[Jebel Serbal]], Jebel Banat, Jebel Sana.
There are many small ponds flowing under the rocks in lush Wadi Talaa Kibira, leading down to the biggest water pool of the area, [[Galt el Azraq]], the Blue Pool. Its colour is actually changing according to the regular floods and melting snow; one brings sand from higher up, the next takes it further down and cleans the pool. It is safe to swim in it.
There are permanent pools at the top of Wadi Shag Tinya, the Kharazet el Shag, in a dramatic setting. The water from Wadi Tinya drops into a granite pool from which it flows down to other pools and falls into a deep wadi, some places running under rocks, at other places resurfacing again. The water is clean enough to drink in the upper pool.
At the beginning of Wadi Shag there is a narrow canyon where there are permanent granite waterpools, from which water is disappearing in the sandy floor at one place and only emerging before the end of the wadi.
Water is trickling from the rock into a double fountain in Wadi Tubug. The lower fountain is for animals, locals drink from the upper one. It is considered safe, although you might need to treat the water. There is also a 1000-year-old mulberry tree in Wadi Tubug, which is protected by tribal law. From Wadi Tubug you can descend to Sid Daud, a narrow and steep path leading through small caves under the boulders.
In the narrow canyon of Wadi Sagar there is another water fountain. Because of the steep path, animals cannot reach it and the water is safe to drink.
A rarely visited route through Wadi Umm Surdi leads through a narrow canyon to Wadi Mathar and another mulberry tree which grows just outside a garden and belongs to everyone.

==Places of interest==
While the main tourist attractions are [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] and [[Mount Sinai]], there are many other places of interest in the area.

[[File:Jebel Abbash Basha.jpg|thumb|The incomplete palace atop Jebel Abbash Basha]]
One of the prime historical attractions in the area is the palace of [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]], the [[Walī]] and self-declared [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] between 1849 and 1854. The palace was built on a mountain called at the time Jebel Tinya, but later named after him and today called Jebel Abbas Basha. The palace has never been finished as he died before it was completed, but the massive {{convert|2|m|ft}}-thick walls made of granite blocks and granite-sand bricks still stand firmly. The open quarry on the top of Jebel Somra, just opposite Jebel Abbas Basha, is still visible with many huge blocks lying around. Other blocks were cut from Wadi Zawatin, at the beginning of the ascent to the palace. The bricks were made on site while the mortar, made of lime and water, was burnt in kilns in the surrounding valleys. To be able to carry out the work, first he had to build a road accessible to camels and donkeys in order to transport the supplies. The road, starting at Abu Jeefa and going through Wadi Tubug and Wadi Zawatin, is still in use today.

Son and successor of the great reformist [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (1805-1848), Abbas Pasha was in many ways the opposite. He had &quot;a lasting distrust of foreigners [and] strongly opposed many of the Western inspired change introduced by his father Mohammed Ali Pasha and he is remembered as a traditionalist and reactionary who undid many of his grandfather's modernising reforms. His secretive and suspicious nature led to much speculation over his death; it is uncertain whether he was murdered or died of a stroke.&quot;
Abbas Pasha was suffering from tuberculosis so one of the reasons he wanted to build his palace in the high mountains was for medical reasons. On the other hand, he liked a secluded lifestyle and had other remote palaces. According to traditions he selected the place after placing meat on the top of Mount Sinai, [[Mount Catherine]] and Mt. Tinya, and it was here at the former that the meat decayed later, suggesting a better environment and cleaner air. Another account recalls that this story was actually made up by the monks to keep him away from the holy peaks. In any case, his selection would have been just as good with magnificent views from the palace over the Sinai mountain range.

Although Abbas is &quot;best remembered for the emancipation of the fellaheen and the construction of the [[Cairo]]-[[Alexandria]] railway line in 1851&quot;, he &quot;had a significant influence on the immediate area around St Katherine. Besides the construction of the mountain top palace he commissioned the building of the camel path up to Mount Sinai and the Askar barracks on the way to the monastery, which now lies in ruins.&quot;

There are hundreds of ruins of [[Byzantine]] monasteries, churches and monastic settlements in the area, some of them not much more than a pile of rocks, others difficult to distinguish from Bedouin buildings, but there are several very well preserved ones. Many can be found in the wide and open Bustan el Birka area, approachable from the settlement of Abu Seila or Abu Zaituna, including churches, houses on hills overlooking gardens in the wadi floor, buildings in clusters and hermit cells under rocks. They are among the best preserved ones and they can be easily reached from the village.
There is a graceful little church in very good shape in Wadi Shrayj, passing other somewhat more ruined Byzantine buildings. Further up from the church there are more ruins, some dating back to the Nabatean era (BC 200 - AD 100).

In Wadi Mathar (Wadi Shag) there is a hermit cell under a huge boulder, the remains of the monks who died in there centuries ago are still in the walled-up chamber. Further up is a well-preserved monastic settlement with houses and a round building which might have been a storage room.

Byzantine Nawamises, burial places with rocks placed around in circles, are found at many locations, such as at the beginning of Wadi Jebal or in Wadi Mathar. Halfway in Wadi Jebal there is a Roman well before you reach a well-preserved Byzantine church next to a walled garden and spring. There is another church at the spring of Ain Nagila, at the foot of Jebel el Bab. You can find ruins of other settlements and buildings in Wadi Tinya, Wadi Shag Tinya, in Farsh Abu Mahashur, and many other places.

The building technique of the Bedouin is taken from the Byzantine settlers, so it is often difficult to tell structures apart. Furthermore, the Bedouin often used the ruins in later times. But there are telling clues. Byzantine buildings were scattered close to each other in small settlements, and round buildings are most likely to be from the Byzantine period. While the Bedouin have storage rooms constructed under rocks, they would have been too low for hermits to pray in an upright, kneeling position. &quot;Rounded-walls, niches and shelves and tiny doors are typical of Byzantine stone dwellings. [Charasteristic] how the stones are laid without mortar and the absence of a roof. You can also find traces of ancient water systems or conduits which were used to direct rain water to the settlement and for irrigation use. Typical of the Byzantine era water conduits or channels directed the mountain rains to cisterns or pools. Water conduits were constructed using natural drainage lines in the granite and by cementing flat stones with a natural mortar. The outdoor courtyards are thought to be an area for meeting guests and for cooking.

A bit further afield, at Serabit al-Khadim, there are ancient turquoise mines and pharaonic temples from the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]], dedicated to [[Hathor]], goddess of love, music and beauty, and from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] dedicated to [[Sopdu]], the god of the Eastern Desert. It can be reached from Wadi Feiran via Wadi Mukattab, the Valley of Inscription.

There is a massive Nawamis close to the Oasis of Ain Hudra, as well as a Pharaonic Rock of Inscription. It lies not far from the main road to [[Dahab]], but one should not attempt to find it yourself. You can probably find guides in Ain Hodra, or organize a safari in St. Katherine that includes it.

The [[Blue Desert]] (Blue Mountain), just before reaching St. Katherine to the left in a wide open wadi. [[Anwar Sadat]], who loved the area and had a house in St. Katherine, paid with his life for this move. The display was made by Belgian artist Jean Verame in 1980-81, who painted many of the boulders over an area of c. {{convert|15|km2|abbr=on}} and a hill blue. From the air it looks like a dove of peace. A popular day trip from the city usually accompanied by a camp fire and music, it adds a bit of blue colour to the red of sunset.

Beyond the many religious places found around the Monastery of St. Catherine and on the top of Mount Sinai and Jebel Safsafa there are many other churches, monasteries and holy places in the area and a bit further afield:

[[File:Vethiy Denmi (Icons from Saint Catherine's Monastery).jpg|thumb|Vethiy Denmi (Icons from Saint Catherine's Monastery)]]
The Chapel of St. Catherine is on the summit of [[Mount Katherine]], the mountain where the body of the saint from Alexandria was placed by angels, according to Christian beliefs. The saint, born as Dorothea in 294 AD, was educated in pagan schools but converted to Christianity for which she was executed. Her body vanished, but some three centuries later, monks guided by a dream found it on the mountain. It was brought down and placed in a golden casket in the Monastery what became known since the 11th century as the Monastery of St. Catherine.

The Monastery of St. Katherine has been a working monastery from its creation in the 4th century through to present day.  It holds one of the most religiously and historically significant libraries in all the world, second only to that of the Vatican.  Being of religious importance to Jews, Muslims, and Christians the area sees nearly 100,000 visitors annually and more are projected every year.  While the struggle to limit access, and visiting hours has done little to preserve the monastery, it has also provided a measure of protection during political turbulence.

Hagar Musa (Rock of Moses) in [[Wadi El Arbain]], where [[Prophet Moses]] fetched water from the rock. A holy place to all the big monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Locals believe the twelve clefts on it represent the twelve springs mentioned in the [[Quran]] (Sura 2:60). It is also mentioned in the Exodus as the rock which sustained the children of Israel (1 Cor. 10:4). There is a small Orthodox chapel next to it. According to Swiss orientalist Johann Ludwig Burkhardt, the Jebeliya Bedouin believe &quot;that by making [female camels] crouch down before the rock [...] the camels will become fertile and yield more milk&quot;. There is also a Bedouin marriage proposal rock in the walled compound.

The Monastery of the Forty Martyrs, in Wadi El Arbain was constructed in the 6th century in honor of the forty Christian martyrs who died in [[Elaiussa Sebaste|Sebaste]] (central [[Turkey]]). Monks relate that forty Christian soldiers from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Army in the 3rd century were commanded to worship pagan gods. They refused and were put to death by being exposed at night to the bitterly cold winds off a frozen lake. Those who survived until morning were killed by the sword. [...] In the grounds of this monastery is a chapel dedicated to the hermit Saint Onuphrius. Coming from [[Upper Egypt]], he was said to have lived for seventy years in the rock shelter at the northern end of the garden, until he died in AD 390.&quot;

The Monastery of Cosmas and Damianos in Wadi Talaa, named after the martyred brothers who were doctors and treated locals for free in the 3rd century AD. The garden of the monastery, looked after by a Bedouin family, has a long olive grove, some tall [[cypress]] trees, other fruit trees and vegetables. There are more gardens belonging to the monastery further down in the wadi.

The Chapel of Saint John Klimakos, or St. John of the Ladder, was built in 1979 in Wadi Itlah to commemorate his devotional work in the 6th century AD. Also spelled St. John Climacus or Climax, the saint spent forty years in solitude in a cave above the existing chapel. &quot;During this time, Klimakos was elected Abbot of Sinai and asked to write a spiritual guide. He composed The Ladder of Divine Ascent which likens spiritual life to the ladder seen by the Patriach Jacob extending from earth to heaven (Genesis 28:12-17).&quot; According to the book the ladder &quot;consists of 30 rungs, each step corresponding to a spiritual virtue. Through silence and solitude hermits and monks sought to climb the divine ladder. The first rung instructs the renunciation of all earthly ties and the next 14 relate to human vices such as talkativeness, anger, despondency and dishonesty. The final 15 rungs relate to virtues including meekness, simplicity, prayer, holy stillness and humility. The crowning virtue is love.&quot;

[[File:WEBSTER(1830) 2.210 WADY FARAN.jpg|thumb|250px|The Oasis of Wadi Fairan, {{circa|lk=no|1830}}]]
The Monastery of Wadi Feiran, with its chapel dedicated to Prophet Moses, is some 60&amp;nbsp;km before reaching St. Katherine. The wadi is mentioned in the Genesis (21:21) &quot;as the place where Hagar dwelt with her son after Abraham sent her away. As late as the 7th century, Firan was a city and an important Christian center, with its own bishop.&quot;

The Monastery of El Tur was built by Emperor Justinian in the important port city, which was an early Christian center from the 3rd century AD. Today it lies in ruins but there is a new monastery in the city, as well as a church and a guest house. The Spring of Moses is reputed for its therapeutic value.

Other important monasteries in the region are the Monastery of Ramhan south of Mount Catherine, the Monastery of Hodra near the oasis of Ain Hodra, and several smaller, ruined monasteries and churches. Most of the best preserved places are found close to the village of St. Katherine in Wadi Shrayj, Wadi Anshel, Bustan el Birka, Wadi Abu Zaituna, and also in the High Mountains such as at Ain Nagila and in Wadi Jebal.

Places important to local people include the tombs of local saints such as Sheikh Harun (Aaron's Tomb) and Shaikh Salah (Nebi-Salah's Tomb) in the main wadi (Wadi Sheikh) before reaching town, or Sheikh Awad and Sheikh Ahmed in the mountains. Some of the Bedouin gather at these tombs to celebrate &quot;Zuara&quot;, while others consider this practice to be &quot;bidaa&quot;, an innovation and not consistent with Islam. (In fact, most of the bidaa is actually predating Islam and is rather a survival of a tradition than an innovation.) Zuara, also known as Sheik Day or Mulid (Moulid), &quot;is performed by most Sinai tribes at the tombs of Sheiks, or in nearby shelters called mak'ad when a Bedouin or group of Bedouin wish to ask the Sheikh to intervene with Allah on their behalf. Zuara is the generic name for any activity of this sort. In addition to the Mulid, the bedouins often practice Zuara on a weekly basis. The sick Bedouins or their relatives, pregnant mothers looking for healthy children, or people looking for a good crop, go to a tomb. [...] Until the 1956 war in the Sinai, the Gebeliya and the Auled-Said shared a common Mulid (the annual Zuara) at the tomb of Nebi-Saleh; however the war forced them to conduct the ceremonies at separate locations; but the tribes are still apparently close. Now the Gebeliya go to Aaron's tomb down the road, and the Auled-Said go to Nebi Salah's tomb. Both go in the 8th month. The Garasha and Sawalha also go to Nebi-Salah's tomb for their Mulid but in the 7th Month.&quot; Some of the Jebeliya gather at the Tomb of Sheikh Awad on the second day of Eid el Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice.

'''Nekhel''' ({{lang-ar|نِخِل}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|ˈnexel}}; also spelled and pronounced ''Nakhl&amp;nbsp;'' {{IPA-arz|næxl|}}) is the capital of Nekhel Municipality of [[North Sinai Governorate]], [[Sinai]], [[Egypt]]. It is located in the heart of [[Sinai]] Peninsula along the southern border of [[North Sinai Governorate]] with [[South Sinai Governorate]]. It is located at the skirts of [[El Tih]] Mountains and foothills at an elevation of {{convert|420.6|m|abbr=on}}.

==History==
{{See also|An-Nakhl Fortress}}
;Pharaonic Era
Nekhel was always part of the [[Egyptian Empire]] throughout history and it was part of the province of &quot;Du Mafkat&quot; in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Nekhel was the ancient capital of the entire Sinai province of Egypt, thanks to its outstanding strategic location at the exact center of the peninsula. In the 16th century BC, the Egyptian [[Pharaohs]] built the way of Shur across [[Sinai]] to [[Beersheba]] and on to [[Jerusalem]]. The region provided the Egyptian Empire with minerals, turquoise, gold and copper, and well-preserved ruins of mines and temples are excavated there.

;Islamic Era
Being located on the new [[Hajj]] Route, Nekhel gained additional significance. In addition to its previous role as a strategic [[An-Nakhl Fortress|fort]] capital of Sinai. Hence, the city became a main rest and trade destination for [[Muslims]] who passed through the Hajj Route during Hajj season from entire [[Africa]] and [[Egypt]] towards Mecca for pilgrimage.

;Ayubi and Memluki Era
During [[Islamic]] rule of [[Ayubid]] Caliphate and [[Mamluks]] in turn. Several Sultans built forts and castles in Nekhel to defend Egypt from [[Crusades]] of [[Middle East]] and [[Red Sea]]. Nekhel played a significant role as an influential military base for the [[Egyptian Army]] during [[Middle Ages]] in defeating Crusades and freeing numerous provinces of the [[Islamic Caliphate]].

==Geography and climate==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies the town's climate as borderline [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (''BWh'') and [[cold desert climate]] (''BWk''). The mountain ranges of [[El Tih]] look at the city from different directions, with several valleys leading from the [[Mediterranean]] in the north, the [[Red Sea]] and [[Suez Gulf]] to the city and the mountains in all directions. The altitude of the city is about {{convert|420.6|m|abbr=on}} above the sea level, however nearby [[El Tih mountains]] are of higher elevation. Therefore, nearby foothills and mountains result in a cooler temperatures. The summer days are quite hot reaching {{convert|40|C}}, yet with moderate nights. At night, Nekhel is one of the coldest cities in Egypt, along with [[Saint Catherine, Egypt#Geography and climate|Saint Catherine]] and the mountainous provinces of [[Sinai]]. 

The area is very dry and averages less than 50 mm a year. Making one of the driest regions on earth. 
Although there are still many permanent water sources in the mountains, the area is continuously drying.

The city also puts a great pressure on the water resources, as ground water in the valley is from the mountains. There is work under way to connect the city to the [[Nile]] via a pipe line.

Nekhel was an important destination on the [[Hajj]] Route for [[Muslims]] from [[Africa]] to the cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Culture and Population==
The traditional people of the area are Bedouins whose culture is very similar to other Bedouin groups. Nekhel Bedouin tribes practice cattle breeding and agriculture which depends on rain and partially common snow. There are also [[Egyptians]] who live there and work in governmental sectors and public services. 

The techniques used are very similar to the [[Byzantine]] methods, partly because of the natural environment. They grow vegetables and fruit in stone walled gardens called bustan or karm, and mastered grafting where a branch of a better yielding low land variety is planted on a more resistant but low yielding mountain variety.
Bedouin houses are simple, small stone structures with cane roofing, either incorporated in the garden wall, or standing alone a bit further up from the wadi floor, away from the devastating flash floods that sweep through after occasional heavy rains. Houses are often built next to huge boulders; natural cracks and holes are used as shelves and candle holders.
Smaller rock shelters and store rooms are constructed under boulders and in walled up caves and are found everywhere in the mountainous area.
You can see ancient leopard traps in many places. A goat was placed in as a bait, and the entrance was slammed closed with a big rock when the leopard entered. There are no more [[leopards]] left in Sinai; the last was spotted in the 1980s.
In many places you can see big boulders with oval marks engraved on the surface. They are marriage proposal rocks, where a lover drew a line around his foot on the rock face next to his lover's foot print. If the two marks are encircled, their wish was granted and they got married.
Wishing Rocks are boulders, usually a short distance from the main paths, with a flat top: if you throw a pebble and it stays on the top, your wish will come true.
According to governmental plans, the population of the city is expected to increase. The increasing numbers of Egyptians living there will succeed in accomplishing that developmental national plan. Most of Nekhel's population is formed of Bedouins while the rest are Egyptians.

==Agriculture==
Agriculture in Nekhel depends mainly on water wells which are found basically in [[Contilla]], [[Tamd]], [[Bir Grid]] and [[Khafga]]. Additionally, rain and snow help on planting crops such as [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[maize|corn]]. Variety of species of plants and crops grow in Nekhel. Mediterranean crops are the main agricultural products. Fruits include [[apple]], [[almond]], [[pear]], [[apricot]], [[peach]], [[pistachio]], [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and [[grapes]]. Wild [[walnut]], [[mulberry]] and [[ficus|fig]] are grown in wild at the eastern portions of the city who get higher precipitation. Like other Mediterranean, Egyptian and [[North Africa]]n cities, [[olives]] are very important in Nekhel, found in many locations.
The gardens are usually built in the wadi floors in the main water course, and are encircled by massive stone walls. These walls have to withstand the regular flash floods, retain the soil - thus called retaining wall - and protect the garden from animals. Water wells are either built in the garden or a number of gardens have one but these wells freeze in winter and sometimes in spring and autumn. Today usually generators pump the water, but you can still see many shadoofs. Water is often found at higher elevations, either in natural springs or in wells made at dykes called jidda. The Bedouin built small dams and closed off canyons to make reservoirs.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Arabia |volume=2 |pages=257, 260}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case water is channelled to small rock pools called birka, from where it was available for irrigation. Water was flown in narrow conduits made of flat rocks sometimes for kilometers -they are still visible but today gardens rely on plastic pipes (khartoom).

==Nature==
The city of Nekhel and the enrite Central Sinai Region fall within the region of [[El Tih Plateau]].
It is a unique high altitude eco-system with many endemic and rare species. Some of the species are endangered, but there are many wild animals, birds, flowers to see. There are many Sinai Agamas, foxes, rock Hyraxes. Rock Hyraxes are frequenting gardens, and there is a wide range of migrating and resident birds from [[Europe]]. Also, there is a large number of feral donkeys in the mountains who migrate to the region and lower lying areas (reportedly as far as [[El Tur]]) in the winter and go back to graze for the more plentiful summer. Many of them belong to families and are stamped with marks. However, they put a big pressure on the eco-system.

One of the principal goals of the Protectorate is to preserve the bio-diversity of the fragile eco-system, with an emphasis on the Nubian Ibex and the wild medicinal and aromatic plants.

Rain and Snow are the best source of water, thus releasing water at a steady pace, replenishing the underwater catchment areas better. Water from rains flows down fast in the barren mountains, which may cause flash-floods and less water remains.

The views from El Tih foothills are spectacular, and there are many other natural sights in the wadi system. There are springs, creeks, water pools, narrow canyons, steep wadis with huge boulders, amazing rock formations, barren plains with islands of lush vegetation. On the top of the mountains there are many interconnected basins with a unique high altitude ecosystem.

==Places of interest==
Nekhel is a great historical place with archeological landscapes and monuments in addition to pretty nature.
Several Pharaohnic archeological sites are expected to be found nearby. The main attractions of the city are:
*[[An-Nakhl Fortress]] of the [[Circassians|Circassian]] [[Mamluki]] sultan [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri]].
*Fountainheads of Arish Valley which runs from the tops [[El Tih]] mountains and foothills.
*Old Hajj Route.
*Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri Carved Rock.
*Metla Corridor.
*Tih Mountains.

'''Agilkia Island''' (also called '''Agilika'''; {{Lang-ar|أجيليكا}}) is an island in the reservoir of the [[Old Aswan Dam]] along the [[Nile|Nile River]] in southern [[Egypt]]; it is the present site of the relocated [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complex of [[Philae]]. Partially to completely flooded by the old dam's construction in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Courtland Penfield]], [[s:Century Magazine/Volume 57/Issue 4/Harnessing the Nile|Harnessing the Nile]], [[Century Magazine]], (February, 1899)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Peel]], [https://archive.org/details/bindingofnilene00peel The Binding of the Nile and the New Soudan], Oxford 1904 , p.76&lt;/ref&gt; the Philae complex was dismantled and relocated to Agilkia island, as part of a wider [[UNESCO]] project&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] World Heritage Committee, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; related to the 1960s construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] and the eventual flooding of many sites posed by its large reservoir upstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Milestones in Archaeology: a Chronological Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |first=Tim |last=Murray |page=464 |year=2007 |isbn=1-57607-186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agilkia'', like the island, was the name chosen for the planned landing site on [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko|a comet]] by the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' spacecraft mission]]'s [[Philae (spacecraft)|''Philae'' lander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20141106-JP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Platt |first=Jane |title=Rosetta Races Toward Comet Touchdown |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-383 |date=6 November 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/11208051/Rosetta-comet-chase-landing-site-named-Agilkia-after-island-in-Nile.html |title=Historic Comet Landing Site Has a New Name: Agilkia |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon initial touchdown however, the lander took a large bounce followed by a smaller one before finally coming to rest perhaps a kilometer away from Agilkia, named Abydos.

'''Gebel el-Silsila''' or '''Gebel Silsileh''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جبل السلسلة - '''Jabal al-Silsila''' or '''Ǧabal as-Silsila''' - &quot;Chain of Mountains&quot; or &quot;Series of Mountains&quot;; [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: '''ẖny''', '''Khenyt''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitchen&quot;&gt;Kitchen (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; '''Kheny'''  or '''Khenu''' - &quot;The Place of Rowing&quot;; [[German language|German]]: '''Dschabal as-Silsila''' - &quot;Ruderort&quot;, or &quot;Ort des Ruderns&quot; - &quot;Place of Rowing&quot;; [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''Gebel Silsila''' - &quot;Monte della Catena&quot; - &quot;Upstream Mountain Chain&quot;) is 65&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Aswan]] in Upper Egypt, where the cliffs on both sides close to the narrowest point along the length of the entire [[Nile]]. The location is between [[Edfu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; in the north towards [[Lower Egypt]] and [[Kom Ombo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; in the south towards [[Upper Egypt]].  The name ''Kheny'' (or sometimes ''Khenu'') means '''&quot;The Place of Rowing&quot;'''. It was used as a major [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarry site]] on both sides of the Nile from at least the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] to [[Greco-Roman]] times. '''Silsila''' is famous for its [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] [[stelai]] and [[cenotaphs]].

==Sandstone quarry==
During the 18th dynasty the Egyptians switched from [[limestone]] to [[sandstone]]. At this time the quarries at [[Gebelein]] were not yielding as much limestone as before. Gebel el-Silsila became a source of sandstone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson (2000), pp. 40, 65, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this stone allowed for the use of larger architraves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt;

Many of the [[talatat]]s used by [[Akhenaten]] were quarried from here, and used in  buildings at [[Luxor]] and [[Amarna]]. A stela from the early part of Akhenaten's reign shows the king offering to [[Amun]] beneath the winged sun-disk. The inscription records that stone was cut for the great [[Benben]] of [[Horus|Harakhty]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley (1998), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
Akhenaten's sculptor [[Bek (sculptor)|Bek]] oversaw the opening of a stone quarry here.

==Shrines, chapels and temples==

The site provided numerous stone quarries on both the west and east sides of the Nile. The site contains many shrines erected by officials who would have been in charge of quarrying the stone. Almost all of Ancient Egypt's great temples derived their sandstone from here,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; such as [[Karnak]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; [[Luxor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; [[Ramesses III]]'s [[Medinet Habu (location)|Medinet Habu]], [[Kom Ombo]], and the [[Ramesseum]].

[[File:Sobek.svg|thumb|left|125px|The crocodile god [[Sobek]], controller of the [[Nile]].]]

===Principal deity Sobek===

The principal deity of Gebel el-Silsila is [[Sobek]],&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt; the god of [[crocodiles]] and controller of the waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; Silsila is located within the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Kom Ombo]] (or Ombos), Kom Ombo being 15&amp;nbsp;km to the south or upriver. The [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] of the Ombite nome exhibit the crocodile and the effigy of the crocodile-headed god Sobek.

===West bank subsites===

The rock-cut temple of Horemheb is referred to as the Great Speos and may have been created in a former sandstone quarry. The temple is dedicated to seven deities, including [[Amun]], the local god [[Sobek]] and Horemheb himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt; Later rulers included further scenes and inscriptions to this structure.  The scenes on the facade of the Great Speos include [[Ramesses III]] offering [[Maat]] to [[Amun-Re]], [[Mut]], [[Khonsu]] and Sobek in one scene and offering Maat to [[Anhur]]-[[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]] in another scene. Elsewhere Ramesses II is depicted in the company of his Vizier [[Neferronpet]], while offering Maat to [[Ptah]] and Sobek. The central doorway contains a stele showing [[Seti II|Sety II]] before Amun-Re, Mut and Khons.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;&gt;Porter &amp; Moss (1937, 2004), vol. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Speos also contains two chapels belonging to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Viziers]]. On the south end of the entrance is the chapel of [[Panehesy (Vizier)|Panehesy]], Vizier to [[Merenptah]]. Panehesy is shown adoring Merenptah. Panehesy is also depicted on a stele showing Merenptah, Queen [[Isetnofret II|Isetnofret]], and Prince Sety-Merenptah (later [[Seti II]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt; On the northern end is a similar chapel of the Vizier [[Paser (Vizier)|Paser]] from the reign of Ramesses II. A stele in the doorway shows Ramesses II, Queen Isetnofret and Princess-Queen [[Bintanath]]. The king is offering Maat to Ptah and [[Nefertem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

South of Horemheb's Great Speos are a collection of erected royal stelae. The stelae date to a variety of reigns.  They include a rock stela depicting [[Ramesses V]] before Amun-Re, Mut, Khons and Sobek.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt; Ramesses III is shown offering Maat to Amun-Re, Mut and Khons.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;
From a much later time is the stele of [[Shoshenq I]]. The scene shows Shoshenq accompanied by his son [[Iuput]]. The text is dated to year 21 of his reign. The goddess [[Mut]] leads the king and his son before Amun-Re, [[Horus|Re-Harakhti]] and [[Ptah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

South of the royal stelae several cut shrines are found. These include shrines for the Scribe of the Treasury of Thutmose, the [[Overseer of the treasuries|Overseer]] of the Seal of Min (from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III), an official named Maa, and the Scribe of the Nome Ahmose (from the time of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III).&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

North of the royal stelae more shrines can be found. One shrine belonged to an official dated to the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III: [[Useramen|User]], vizier. A shrine at this site records User's family, including his father [[Amethu called Ahmose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor-Cline&quot;&gt;O'Connor &amp; Cline (2006), pp. 48, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further shrines were constructed near the river. Most of these date to the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III. Included are the shrines of some high-ranking officials such as the Overseer of the Granaries Minnakht, the Overseer of the Seal and Royal Herald Sennufer, the Overseer of the Seal Nehesy, the [[Overseer of Upper Egypt|Overseer of the Prophets of Upper and Lower Egypt]] [[Hapuseneb]], and the Great Steward of the Queen [[Senenmut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt; Senenmut's is noteworthy because the inscriptions show a change in the status of [[Hatshepsut]]. She is said to be the &quot;King's First-born Daughter&quot; and she is depicted as a pharaoh in a striding fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor-Cline&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, three rock-cut [[Egyptian temple|shrines]] were constructed and the site also shows some royal stelae. The shrines belong to [[Seti I]], [[Ramesses II]] and [[Merenptah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt; One of the stele depicts Ramesses III offering wine to Amun-Re, Re-Harakhty and Hapi. The stele mentions year 6 of the reign of Ramesses III. Adjoining this is another stele, this one depicting Horemheb adoring Sety I.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

Between the shrines of Merenptah and Ramesses II a stele was erected depicting Merenptah and a son (likely Sety-Merenptah, but the name has been destroyed) offering Maat to Amun-Re. The royals are accompanied by the Vizier Panehesy.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

===East bank subsites===
[[File:Stela-Amenhotep4-Silsila.png|thumb|left|150 px|Stele of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) from Gebel el-Silsila.&lt;ref name=Lepsius/&gt; Kings are shown adoring Amun-Re.&lt;ref name=Lepsius/&gt; ''Image depiction from [[Karl Richard Lepsius|Lepsius]]''.&lt;ref name=Lepsius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lepsius (1849), Vol. 4 (Texts) (Upper Egypt), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Survey work of the east bank has revealed 49 quarries, the largest being Quarry 34 (Q34) (reviewed in 7 partitions due to its immensity) containing 54 stone huts.

The East bank holds several stele from the time of [[Amenhotep III]]. The stele and their texts are described in [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]' ''Denkmahler''. The stelae are damaged, but one of them was inscribed in year 35. Amenhotep is shown adoring Amun-Re and is called &quot;beloved of [[Sobek]]&quot; in the inscriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lepsius&quot;&gt;Lepsius (1849).&lt;/ref&gt; The stela have been studied and described by [[Georges Legrain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

A shrine with stele on three sides depicting Amenhotep III is located at Gebel el-Silisila East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lepsius&quot;/&gt; In the scenes Amenhotep III is accompanied by an official named Amenhotep, who held the title &quot;Eyes of the King in the whole land&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

A stela was discovered showing [[Akhenaten]] - named Amenhotep IV -  before [[Amun]]-[[Ra|Re]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

Further finds date to the time of [[Sety I]]. An inscription from year 6 shows Sety I before Amun-Re, [[Ptah]] and a goddess. Another stele shows the Commander of troops of the fortress of the Lord of the Two Lands, named Hapi adoring the cartouche of Sety I.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM5&quot;/&gt;

The rediscovery of the Temple of Kheny&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; is a significant find for the east bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt; The other item of significance is the collection of over 5,000 epigraphic symbols and hieroglyphs collected from this site and all over Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt; There appears to be an image depicting the actual transport of the sandstone blocks to temple sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt;

The east bank also has two unfinished ram-headed sphinxes or [[criosphinxes]].

Indications have been noted of possible stables providing horses to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt;

==Temple of Kheny (Temple of Sobek)==

Remains of the '''Temple of Kheny''' have been rediscovered&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; as surface remnants at Gebel el Silsila,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt; showing the temple foundations and blockwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; The ruins are one of the few remnants of the settlement of Kheny or Khenu, the ancient Egyptian name, meaning “Rowing Place”, for Gebel el-Silsila.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;&gt;''DNews'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The finding confirms that Gebel el Silsila is a sacred site in addition to its quarry function.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; It is unknown at this time to whom the temple is dedicated,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; but there are indications that it may be to Sobek.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;&gt;''Intrepid'' radio interview (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the site seems to lean towards solar worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt;

The worship center was described as a destroyed [[Ramesside]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; temple on a 1934 published rudimentary map by [[Egyptologist]] [[Ludwig Borchardt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; after being recorded between 1906 and 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; The temple was then forgotten and lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;

The temple appears to have four &quot;[[ashlar|dressed]] floor levels&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; Two painted sandstone fragments indicate that the temple's ceiling had an astronomical motif with stars and sky representing the celestial heavens.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;

The rediscovery and on-site work have been conducted since 2012 by teams led by archeologists Maria Nilsson&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; and John Ward&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; as part of the Gebel el Silsila Survey Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;

===Possible official change from limestone to sandstone in Ancient Egypt===

The changeover of constructing temples in Ancient Egypt from limestone to sandstone may have started with the Temple of Kheny.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt; It appears that the Temple of Kheny may be the &quot;mother temple&quot; to all future temples built with sandstone.&lt;ref name=&quot;IR&quot;/&gt;

According to Nilsson:&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;

{{quotation|1= The oldest building phase of the temple was made up by limestone, which is unique within a sandstone quarry, and may signify the official changeover from limestone construction to sandstone.}}

The entire site of Gebel el Silsila covering about 20 square kilometers is in a multi-year [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] [[archaeological field survey|survey project]] directed by [[archaeology|archaeologist]] Maria Nilsson&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; under the auspices of [[Lund University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt; and assistant-director John Ward. As of 2015, the team had 13 members, 2 SCA  inspectors, and assistants.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gebel el Silsila Survey Project|url=http://gebelelsilsilaepigraphicsurveyproject.blogspot.com.au/|website=Gebel el Silsila Survey Project|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various teams organized by them have been working on-site since 2012. Emphasis has been placed on the east bank due to insufficient recording in the past and deteriorating conditions in the present epigraphically. Its major finding is the Temple of Kheny. The project is also noted for its use of [[computational archaeology|digital archaeology]].

The survey project has also found a blue [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]], an amulet depiction of a [[dung beetle]].

==Climate==

The present-day climate of Gebel el-Silsila (Khenu) is extremely clear, dry, bright, and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with low seasonal variation, and with about 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Silsila is located in one of the sunniest regions on Earth.

The [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies the weather of Gebel el-Silsila  as a [[hot desert climate|hot desert climate (BWh)]], like the rest of Egypt.

Winters are short, brief, and extremely warm. Wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine, made only more bearable because the desert air is dry.

The climate of Khenu is extremely dry year-round, with less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm of average annual precipitation. The desert locale is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air is mainly dry here and becomes drier southward and upriver towards Aswan. The air becomes more humid northward and downriver towards [[Luxor]].

'''Buto''' ({{lang-el|Βουτώ}}, {{lang-ar|بوتو}}, ''Butu''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Butus''' ({{lang-el|Βοῦτος}}, ''Boutos''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus|Herod.]] ii. 59, 63, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Butosus''', now '''Tell El Fara'in''' (&quot;Hill of the Pharaohs&quot;) and the village of '''Ibtu''' or '''Abtu''' near the city of '''[[Desouk]]''' ({{lang-ar|دسوق}}),&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, R. H. ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson 2000, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient city located 95&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Alexandria]] in the [[Nile Delta]] of [[Egypt]]. The city stood on the [[Sebennytic]] branch of the [[Nile]], near its mouth, and on the southern shore of the Butic Lake ({{lang-el|Βουτικὴ λίμνη}}, ''Boutikē limnē'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] xvii. p. 802)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the modern ''Kem Kasir''.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}

Buto originally was two cities, '''Pe''' and '''Dep''',&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, XVII., i., 18&lt;/ref&gt; which merged into one city that the Egyptians named '''[[pr (hieroglyph)|Per]]-[[Wadjet]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dainst.org/index_511801f4bb1f14a187010017f0000011_en.html Webpage for Buto], modern Tell El Fara'in at the website of the [[German Archaeological Institute|DAI]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The goddess [[Wadjet]] was its local deity, often represented as a [[cobra]], also considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt. Her [[oracle]] was located in her renowned temple in that city. An annual festival held in the city celebrated Wadjet. The city also contained a sanctuary of [[Horus]] and much later, became associated with [[Isis]].

The city was an important site in the [[Predynastic]] era of [[Ancient Egypt]] that includes the cultural developments of ten thousand years from the [[Paleolithic]] to 3100 BC. Archaeological evidence shows that [[Upper Egypt]]ian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]] were unified, and the replacement is considered important evidence for the unification of the two portions of Egypt into one entity. At that time Wadjet joined [[Nekhbet]], who was represented as a white [[vulture]] and held the same position as the patron of Upper Egypt, and together they were known as the ''[[Two Ladies|two ladies]]'' [4] who were the patrons of the unified Egypt. The image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the [[Uraeus]] that would encircle the crown of the pharaohs who ruled the unified Egypt.

The Greeks coined the toponym ''Buto'' under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] a dynasty that ruled from 305 to 30 BC. It served as the capital, or according to Herodian, merely the principal village of the Nile Delta. Herodotus (''l. c.'') styled it the [[Nome (Egypt)#Upper Egypt|Chemmite nome]], [[Ptolemy]] knew it as the Phthenothite [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] ({{lang|grc|Φθενότης}}, iv. 5. § 48), and [[Pliny the Elder]] as Ptenetha.&lt;ref&gt;v. 9. s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historians record that the town was celebrated for its monolithite temple and oracle of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|goddess]] Wadjet (Buto),&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ii. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aelian. ''V. Hist.'' ii. 41&lt;/ref&gt; whom the Greeks identified with [[Leto]] or [[Latona]]. A yearly feast was held there in honour of the goddess.

They noted that at Buto there was also a sanctuary of [[Horus]] (associated by the [[ancient Greeks]] with [[Apollo]]) and of [[Bastet]] (associated with [[Artemis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Champollion]], ''l'Egypte'', vol. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek name, Buto, is nearly allied to that of ''Muth'' or ''Maut'', their appellations for [[Isis]], as ''Mother of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch|Plut]]. ''Is. et Osir.'' 18, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these same late sources, the [[shrew]] was worshipped at Buto.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ii. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serabit el-Khadim''' ({{lang-ar|سرابيط الخادم}} {{IPA-ar|saraːˈbiːtˤ alˈχaːdɪm}} (also transliterated Serabit al-Khadim, Serabit el-Khadem) is a  locality in the southwest [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]], where [[turquoise]] was mined extensively in antiquity, mainly by the ancient Egyptians. Archaeological excavation, initially by Sir [[Flinders Petrie]], revealed ancient mining camps and a long-lived Temple of [[Hathor]], the Egyptian goddess who was favoured as a protector in desert regions.

==Archaeological findings==
Thirty incised [[graffiti]] in a &quot;[[Middle Bronze Age alphabets#Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic script]]&quot; shed light on the [[history of the alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Kyle McCarter. &quot;The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet&quot;, ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''37'''.3 (September 1974:54-68) pp 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The mines were worked by prisoners of war from southwest Asia who presumably spoke a [[Northwest Semitic]] language, such as the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] that was ancestral to [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].  After a century of study and the initial publication by [[Flinders Petrie|Sir Flinders Petrie]], researchers agree on the decipherment of a single phrase, cracked in 1916 by [[Alan Gardiner]]: לבעלת ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|l bʿlt}}'' (to the Lady) [''{{Transl|ar|DIN|baʿlat}}'' (Lady) being a title of Hathor and the feminine of the title ''[[Baal|{{Transl|ar|DIN|Baʿal}}]]'' (Lord) given to the Semitic god], although the word ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|m’hb}}'' (loved) is frequently cited as a second word. 

The script has graphic similarities with the Egyptian [[hieratic]] script, the less elaborate form of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s. In the 1950s and 60s it was common to show the derivation of the Canaanite alphabet from hieratic, using [[William F. Albright|William Albright]]'s interpretations of Proto-Sinaitic as the key. It was generally accepted that the language of the inscriptions was Semitic, that the script had a hieratic prototype and was ancestral to the Semitic alphabets, and that the script was itself acrophonic and alphabetic (more specifically, a consonantal alphabet or [[abjad]]). The word ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|baʿlat}}'' (Lady) lends credence to the identification of the language as Semitic. However, the lack of further progress in decipherment casts doubt over the other suppositions, and the identification of the hieratic prototypes remains speculative.

Romanus Francois Butin of Catholic University of America published articles in the ''Harvard Theological Review'' based on the 1927 Harvard Mission to Serabit and the 1930 Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition. His article &quot;The Serabit Inscriptions: II. The Decipherment and Significance of the Inscriptions&quot; provides an early detailed study of the inscriptions and some dozen B/W photographs, hand-drawings and analysis of the previously published inscriptions, #346, 349, 350-354, and three new inscriptions, #355-368.  At that time, #355 was still in situ at Serabit but had not been photographed by the previous Harvard Mission.  In 1932, he wrote:  &quot;The present article was begun with the limited purpose of making known the new inscriptions discovered by the Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition to Serabit in the spring of 1930. In the course of this study, I perceived that some signs doubtful in the inscriptions already published were made clear by the new slabs, and I decided to go over the entire field again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7813429 Vol. 25:2 (1932) The Serabit Expedition of 1930: IV. The Protosinaitic Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; Both articles provide an analysis of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions during earlier expeditions to the site.  

==Relation to Mount Sinai==
In her book ''A History of Sinai'', [[Lina Eckenstein]] theorized that Serabit el-Khadim was the historical site of Mt. Sinai where Moses received the 10 commandments.  This theory comes in no small part to the site containing a temple of [[Hathor]] which is believed to be the Golden Calf idol constructed by the Hebrews while Moses was on the mountain top.

'''Heliopolis''' was a major city of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was the capital of the [[13th Nome|13th]] or [[Heliopolite Nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]] and a major religious center. It is now located in [[Ayn Shams]], a northeastern suburb of [[Cairo]].

Heliopolis was one of the oldest cities of [[ancient Egypt]], occupied since the [[Predynastic Period of Egypt|Predynastic Period]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Dobrowolska, 15&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Dobrowolska |author2=Dobrowolski |display-authors=1 |title=Heliopolis: Rebirth of the City of the Sun |isbn=9774160088 |date=2006 |p=15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It greatly expanded under the [[Old Kingdom|Old]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]s but is today mostly destroyed, its temples and other buildings having been scavenged for the construction of medieval [[Cairo]]. Most information about the ancient city comes from surviving records.

The major surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the [[Egyptian obelisk|obelisk]] of the Temple of [[Ra (god)|Ra]]-[[Atum]] erected by [[Senusret I]] of [[Dynasty XII]]. It still stands in its original position, now within Al-Masalla in [[Al-Matariyyah]], [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/NUM_ORC/OBELISK_Gr_b3EXivrcos_diminutiv.html |contribution=Obelisk |title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''11th ed.'' |date=1911 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|21|m|abbr=on}} high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000&amp;nbsp;lbs).

Heliopolis is the [[Latinisation of names|latinized]] form of the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] name ''Hēlioúpolis'' ({{lang|grc|Ἡλιούπολις}}), meaning &quot;City of the Sun&quot;. [[Helios (god)|Helios]], the [[personification|personified]] and [[sun god|deified]] form of the [[sun]], [[interpretatio graeca|was identified]] by the Greeks with the native [[Egyptian gods]] [[Ra (god)|Ra]] and [[Atum]], whose principal cult was located in the city.

Its [[endonym|native name]] was ''{{lang|egy|I͗wnw}}'' (&quot;The Pillars&quot;), whose exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian recorded only consonantal values. Its traditional [[Egyptologist|Egyptological]] transcription is ''Iunu'' but it appears in [[Biblical Hebrew language|biblical Hebrew]] as ''Ôn'' ({{Hebrew|אן}}) and ''Āwen'' ({{Hebrew|און}}), leading some scholars to [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstruct its pronunciation]] as ''*Āwanu''. Variant transcriptions include ''Awnu'' and ''Annu''.

The city also appears in the [[Old Kingdom]] [[Pyramid Texts]] as the &quot;House of Ra&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Reallexikon der Ägyptischen Religionsgeschichte |first=Hans |last=Bonnet }}. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lower Egypt-en.png|thumb|Map of ancient Lower Egypt showing Heliopolis]]

===Egyptian Heliopolis===
{{further|Ancient Egypt}}
In [[ancient Egypt]], Heliopolis was a regional center from [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic times]].

[[File:Model of a Votive Temple Gateway at Heliopolis (49.183). 66.228.jpg|thumbnail|Model of a Votive Temple Gateway at Heliopolis, [[Dynasty XIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Model of a Votive Temple Gateway at Heliopolis (49.183) |contribution-url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3756/Model_of_a_Votive_Temple_Gateway_at_Heliopolis_49.183 |title=''Official site'' |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |accessdate=8 July 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was principally notable as the cult center of the [[sun god]] [[Atum]], who [[syncretism|came to be identified]] with [[Ra]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses |first=George |last=Hart |isbn=0-415-34495-6 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Ra-harakhty|Horus]]. The primary [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of the city was known as the Great House ({{lang-egy|Pr Ꜥꜣt}} or ''Per Aat'', ''*Par ʻĀʼat'') or House of Atum (''{{lang|egy|Pr I͗tmw}}'' or ''Per Atum'', ''*Par-ʼAtāma''; {{lang-he|פתם}}, ''[[Pithom]]''). Its priests maintained that Atum or Ra was the first being, rising self-created from the primeval waters. A decline in the importance of Ra's cult during [[Dynasty V]] led to the development of the [[Ennead]], a grouping of nine major Egyptian gods which placed the others in subordinate status to Ra–Atum. The [[High Priest of Re|high priests of Ra]] are not as well documented as those of other deities, although the high priests of [[Dynasty VI]] ({{c.|2345|2181}}{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) have been discovered and excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-el-matariya-tombs-egy-cai-elmat.htm Planetware: Priests of Ra tombs, Heliopolis—Al-Matariyyah . accessed 01.28.2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223101624/http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-el-matariya-tombs-egy-cai-elmat.htm |date=2010-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Amarna Period]] of [[Dynasty XVIII]], [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] introduced a kind of [[monotheism|monotheistic worship]] of [[Aten]], the deified solar disc. As part of his construction projects, he built a Heliopolitan temple named &quot;Elevating Aten&quot; (''{{lang|egy|Wṯs I͗tn}}'' or ''Wetjes Atum''), whose stones can still be seen in some of the gates of Cairo's medieval city wall. The cult of the [[Mnevis]] bull, another embodiment of the Sun, had its altar here as well. Their personal formal burial ground was situated north of the city.

The store-city [[Pithom]] is mentioned once in the [[Hebrew people|Hebrew]] [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] (Exodus 1:11), and according to one theory, this was Heliopolis.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Hellenistic Heliopolis===
[[Alexander the Great]], on his march from [[Pelusium]] to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], halted at this city;&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, iii. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple of Ra was said to have been, to a special degree, a depository for royal records, and Herodotus states that the priests of Heliopolis were the best informed in matters of history of all the Egyptians. Heliopolis flourished as a seat of learning during the Greek period; the schools of philosophy and astronomy are claimed to have been frequented by [[Orpheus]], [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=agd-eLVNRMMC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA72,M1 Book I, ch VI].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Solon]], and other Greek philosophers. [[Ichonuphys]] was lecturing there in 308 BC, and the Greek mathematician [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], who was one of his pupils, learned from him the true length of the year and month, upon which he formed his [[octaeterid]], or period of 8 years or 99 months.  [[Ptolemy II]] had [[Manetho]], the chief priest of Heliopolis, collect his history of the ancient kings of Egypt from its archives. The later [[Ptolemies]] probably took little interest in their &quot;father&quot; Ra, and [[Alexandria]] had eclipsed the learning of Heliopolis; thus with the withdrawal of royal favour Heliopolis quickly dwindled, and the students of native lore deserted it for other temples supported by a wealthy population of pious citizens.  By the 1st century BC, in fact, [[Strabo]] found the temples deserted, and the town itself almost uninhabited, although priests were still present.

Heliopolis was well known to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]], being noted by most major geographers of the period, including [[Ptolemy]], [[Herodotus]] and others, down to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] geographer [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy]], iv. 5. § 54; [[Herodotus]], ii. 3, 7, 59; [[Strabo]], xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;805; [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], i. 84, v. 57; [[Arrian]], ''Exp. Alex.'' iii. 1; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''H. A.'' vi. 58, xii. 7; [[Plutarch]], ''Solon.'' 26, ''Is. et Osir.'' 33; [[Diogenes Laertius]], xviii. 8. § 6; [[Josephus]], ''Ant. Jud.'' xiii. 3, ''C. Apion.'' i. 26; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''  iii. 21; [[Pliny the Elder]], v. 9. § 11; [[Tacitus]], ''Ann.'' vi. 28; [[Pomponius Mela]], iii. 8. [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] geographer [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''s. v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἡλίουπόλις}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Heliopolis===
In [[Roman Egypt]], Heliopolis belonged to the [[list of Roman provinces|province]] [[Augustamnica]], causing it to appear as {{nowrap|'''Heliopolis in Augustamnica'''}} when it needed to be distinguished from [[Baalbek]]. Its population probably contained a considerable [[Arabians|Arabian]] element.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Pliny the Elder|Plin.]] |title=[[Pliny's Natural History|Nat. Hist.]] |at=vi, 34 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the city's [[obelisk]]s were removed to adorn more northern cities of the Delta and [[Rome]]. Two of these eventually became [[London]]'s [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] and its twin in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Central Park]].

[[File:Cogniet Leon Bataille D Heliopolis.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Heliopolis (1800)|Battle of Heliopolis]] during the Napoleon's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] in 1800]]
===Islamic Heliopolis===
During the Middle Ages, the growth of [[Fustat]] and [[Cairo]] only a few kilometres away caused its ruins to be massively scavenged for building materials, including for their city walls. The site became known as the &quot;Well of the Sun&quot; (''Ayn Shams'') and ''ʻArab al-Ḥiṣn''.

==Legacy==
The importance of the solar cult at Heliopolis is reflected in both ancient pagan and current monotheistic beliefs. [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] and [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]] held that the [[bennu]] or [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] brought the ashes of its predecessor to the altar of the sun god at Heliopolis each time it was reborn. In the [[Hebrew people|Hebrew]]'s [[Jewish Bible|scriptures]], Heliopolis is referenced directly and obliquely, usually in reference to its prominent pagan cult. In his prophesies against Egypt, [[Isaiah]] claimed the &quot;City of the Sun&quot; (''Ir ha Shemesh'') would be one of the five Egyptian cities to follow the Lord of Heaven's army and speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 19:18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Variant texts read &quot;City of Destruction&quot; (''Ir ha Heres'') instead.}} [[Jeremiah]] and [[Ezekiel]] mention the &quot;House of the Sun&quot; (''Beth Shemesh'') and Ôn, claiming [[Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylonian Empire|Babylon]] would shatter its obelisks and burn its temple&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Jeremiah|43:13|NASB|Jeremiah 43:13 NASB; ''Compare'' NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its &quot;young men of Folly&quot; (''Aven'') would &quot;fall by the sword&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ezekiel|30:17|NIV|Ezekiel 30:17 NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Syrian Heliopolis&quot; [[Baalbek]] has been claimed to have gained its solar cult from a priest colony emigrating from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturn.'', i. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heliopolis in Augustamnica remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Present site==
The ancient city is currently located about {{convert|15|-|20|m|sp=us|0}} below the streets of the middle- and lower-class suburbs of [[Al-Matariyyah]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Dobrowolska, 15&quot;/&gt; [[Ain Shams]], and [[Tel Al-Hisn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/744/fe1.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; City of the sun |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325171032/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/744/fe1.htm |archivedate=2013-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in northern [[Cairo]]. The area is about {{convert|1.5|km|sp=us|0}} west of the [[Heliopolis (Cairo Suburb)|modern suburb which bears its name]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Dobrowolska, 15&quot;/&gt;

Some ancient city walls of crude brick can be seen in the fields, a few granite blocks bearing the name of [[Ramesses II]] remain, and the position of the great Temple of Ra-Atum is marked by the Al-Masalla obelisk. Archaeologists excavated some of its tombs in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;egipto&quot;&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.egiptomania.com/asade/novedades/descubrimientos4.htm |contribution=Pharonic tomb uncovered in Cairo, suburbs of Matariya |title=Egiptomania |date=26 August 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sadd el-Kafara''' (&quot;Dam of the Infidels&quot;) was a [[masonry]] [[embankment dam]] on [[Wadi al-Garawi]] 10&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Helwan]] in [[Helwan Governorate]], [[Egypt]]. The dam was built in the first half of the third millennium BC by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians for [[flood control]] and is the oldest dam of such size in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;eardam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahlbusch|first=Henning|title=Early   Dams|url=http://www.thomastelford.com/journals/DocumentLibrary/ehah.2009.162.1.13.pdf|publisher=History   Association|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hisgd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Developments in the History of Embankment Dams |url=http://www.simscience.org/cracks/advanced/ebnk_hist1.html |publisher=SimScience |accessdate=19 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831131906/http://www.simscience.org/cracks/advanced/ebnk_hist1.html |archivedate=August 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Never completed, the dam was under construction for 10–12 years before being destroyed by a flood. It was rediscovered by [[Georg August Schweinfurth|Georg Schweinfurth]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancegy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bard|first=Kathryn A.|title=Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt|year=1999|publisher=Routledge – Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=0-203-98283-5|pages=1057–1062|author2=Steven Blake Shubert }}&lt;/ref&gt;.......

==Specifications==

The [[dam]] was not finished but was about 111m long and 14m tall with a base width of 98m and crest width of 56m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Sadd-el-Kafara Dam|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0010843|publisher=Structurae|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's core was 32m wide and consisted of 60,000 tons of earth and rock-fill. Surrounding the core were two loosely filled rubble and rock-fill layer-walls. The downstream wall was about 37m wide, the upstream wall about 29m wide and they encompassed {{convert|2900|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of material. Encasing the dam were upstream and downstream walls created from [[limestone]] [[ashlar]]s. The ashlars were set but not mortared in stepped rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jansen|first=Robert B.|title=DAMS  FROM THE BEGINNING|url=http://ussdams.com/ussdeducation/Media/damsfrombegin.doc.|publisher=USSDams.com|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each ashlar was roughly {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and roughly {{convert|50|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;eardam&quot;/&gt;

==Destruction==

Because of erosion on the downstream face of the incomplete dam and its lack of a [[spillway]], it is believed that a flood destroyed it. In addition, there was no evidence of a trench or tunnel that would have diverted water in the wadi around the construction site. Construction on the upstream side of the dam was mostly complete but the downstream side was much less developed. The crest of the dam sloped towards the center which the engineers may have intended to use as a spillway. However, as the top of the dam was not beheaded it was not protected from flood water that would over-top the crest. The dam's proximity to the fertile [[Nile|Nile River]] and distance from populations indicates it was built for protection against such events, similar to those that still occur today.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancegy&quot;/&gt; If complete, the dam would have stored {{convert|465000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} – {{convert|625000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of water and flooding would have caused the reservoir to flood into adjacent parallel wadis.  The dam's failure likely made Egyptian engineers reluctant to construct another for nearly eight centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisgd&quot;/&gt;

Another indication that the dam may have been diminished due to flooding, or an overflow, is that the dam, itself, did not contain high quantities of silt, implying that the dam did not last long enough for the river to leave an obvious residual fingerprint on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saxena|first=K.R.|title=Dams: Incidents and Accidents|year=2005|publisher=A.A.

[[File:Carte-nécropole-Gizeh-Est.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the East Field in Giza]]
'''The East Field''' is located to the east of Khufu’s pyramid and contains cemetery G 7000. This cemetery was a burial place for some of the family members of Khufu.
The cemetery also includes mastabas from tenants and priests of the pyramids dated to the 5th dynasty and 6th dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;&gt;[[Bertha Porter|Porter, Bertha]] and [[Rosalind Moss|Moss, Rosalind L. B.]], ''Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings. Volume III. Memphis. Part I. Abû Rawâsh to Abûṣîr.'' 2nd edition, revised and augmented by Jaromír Málek, The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1974. [http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf_library/porter-moss_III_giza.pdf PDF from The Giza Archives, 29,5 MB] Retrieved February 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Field consists of the three Queen's pyramids and a number of [[mastaba]]s labeled Cemetery G 7000. Reisner constructed a timeline for the construction of the East Field. The first two Queen's Pyramids, G 1a and G 1b, were likely started in year 15-17 of King [[Khufu]]. Usually Queen's pyramids were constructed to the south of the king's pyramid, but in this instance a quarry was located to the south and the construction of the smaller pyramids was relocated to the east of the main pyramid complex. 
The earliest part of the cemetery consisted of 12 mastabas which were built as double mastabas. They were laid out in three rows of four tombs: 
* G 7110-7120 [[Kawab]] and [[Hetepheres II]] and G 7130-7140 [[Khufukhaf I]] and his wife [[Nefertkau II]]
* G 7210-7220 [[Hordjedef]] and his wife and G 7230-7240
* G 7310-7320 [[Baufra]] and G 7330-7340
The construction of these tombs has been dated to ca year 17-24 of the reign of Khufu. This core was then completed to create a nucleus of eight twin-mastabas by the construction of:
* G 7410-7420 [[Meresankh II]] and [[Horbaef]] and G 7430-7440 [[Minkhaf I]]
The rest of the eastern field was built around this group of eight twin mastabas. Of these the great mastaba G 7510 of king's son and vizier [[Ankhhaf]] stands out due to its size. The construction of several other mastabas can be dated to the time of King [[Khafra]]. G 7530 + 7540, the tomb of [[Meresankh III]], contains quarry inscriptions dating to year 13 of that king. Mastaba G 7050, belonging to [[Nefertkau I]], was built during the reign of [[Khafra]] as well. Further additions date to the end of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th]], [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th]] and [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]] and even later.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAR1942&quot;&gt;[[George Andrew Reisner|Reisner, George Andrew]], ''A History of the Giza Necropolis Volume I.''

==Queen's pyramids==

Pyramid G 1a was at first thought to belong to Queen [[Meritites I]] but Lehner has shown that the pyramid belonged to [[Hetepheres I]] instead. All three pyramids have a square base measuring about 45 – 49 m. on a side. The angle of inclination is about 51° 50‘ for all three.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miroslav Verner|Verner, Miroslav]], ''The Pyramids. The Mystery, Culture, and Science of Egypt's Great Monuments.'' Atlantic, London 2001, {{ISBN|0-8021-3935-3}}, pp 210–212, 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Giza West Field''' is located on the [[Giza Plateau]], to the west of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Khufu]]’s pyramid. It is divided up into smaller areas like the cemeteries known as the Abu Bakr Excavations (1949-50, 1950-1,1952 and 1953), as well as several cemeteries whose toponyms are based on the [[mastaba]] numbers such as Cemetery G 1000 and Cemetery G 1100. The West Field contains Cemetery G1000 – Cemetery G1600, and Cemetery G 1900. Further cemeteries in this field are: Cemeteries G 2000, G 2200, G 2500, G 3000, G 4000, and G 6000. Three other cemeteries are named after their excavators: Junker Cemetery West, Junker Cemetery East and Steindorff Cemetery. &lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;&gt;[[Bertha Porter|Porter, Bertha]] and [[Rosalind Moss|Moss, Rosalind L.

==Cemetery G 2100==

Cemetery G 2100 was first excavated by Lepsius in 1842. The first tomb to be cleared was the mastaba owned by Merib (G 2100). In 1905/6 the Harvard-Boston Museum expedition excavated this cemetery and further excavations date to 1912-13 and 1931-32. The cemetery consists of four rows of large mastabas:
* The western most row consists of the mastabas of Merib (G 2100 I), Sedit (G 2100) and Nefer (G 2110).
* A second row consists of the mastabas of Seshatsekhentiu (G 2120), Khentka (G 2130).
* The third row consists of mastabas G 2135 (Unknown), G 2140 (Unknown) and G 2150 (Kanefer)
* The fourth row consists of the mastabas of Kaninisut I (G 2155) and G 2160 and G 2170 (both owners unknown)
The other smaller mastabas were built among these larger structures. The presence of [[Reserve heads]] and slab stela points to the reign of [[Khufu]] for the construction of the earliest of the tombs in this cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Der Manuelian|Manuelian, Peter Der]], ''A re-examination of Reisner's Nucleus cemetery concept at Giza.

==Cemetery G 2300==

The family complex of [[Senedjemib Inti]] makes up an important part of this cemetery. Senedjemib Inti (G 2370) was vizier and chief architect to King [[Djedkare Isesi]]. His son [[Senedjemib Mehi]] (G 2378) followed in his footsteps as the vizier and chief architect under [[Unas]], and eventually another son named [[Khnumenti]] (G 2374) became vizier under [[Teti]]. A man named Mer-ptah-ankh-meryre Nekhebu (G 2381) may be a grandson of Inti. Nekhebu's sons Mer-ptah-ankh-meryre Ptahshepses Impy and Sabu-ptah Ibebi were buried in this cemetery as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Brovarski|Brovarski, Edward]], ''Giza Mastabas Volume 7.

'''Cemetery GIS''' is a necropolis in the [[Giza Plateau]]. It derives its name from its proximity to pyramid G I ([[Khufu]]). The tombs are located on the south side of that pyramid and hence the name G I South Cemetery. Reisner thought the cemetery a continuation of the G7000 cemetery which is part of the [[Giza East Field]]. The construction postdates that of mastaba G 7070 of [[Sneferukhaf]]. Junker dated the cemetery to the reign of [[Menkaure]] based on the presence of granite powder thought to derive from the dressing of the second pyramid at Giza. Reisner allows for a possible construction date dating to the reign of [[Khafre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GAR1942&quot;&gt;[[George Andrew Reisner|Reisner, George Andrew]], ''A History of the Giza Necropolis Volume I.''

This cemetery also contains several [[mastaba]]s built of stone, which date to as late as the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]]. Tombs from the time of Menkaure include the mastabas of the royal chamberlain Khaemnefert, the King’s son Khufudjedef who was master of the royal largesse, and an official named Niankhre.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;&gt;[[Bertha Porter|Porter, Bertha]] and [[Rosalind Moss|Moss, Rosalind L.

'''Nabta Playa''' was once a large [[Endorheic basin|internally drained basin]] in the [[Nubian Desert]], located approximately 800 kilometers south of modern-day [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nubia&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Slayman | first = Andrew L. | title =  Neolithic Skywatchers | publisher = [[Archaeological Institute of America]] | date = May 27, 1998 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/nubia.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 100 kilometers west of [[Abu Simbel]] in southern [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Wendorf | first = Fred | author-link = Fred Wendorf | last2 = Schild | first2 = Romuald | author2-link = Romuald Schild | title = Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa (Sahara), southwestern Egypt | publisher = Comparative Archaeology Web | date = November 26, 2000 | url = http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html | archivedate = August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 22.51° north, 30.73° east.&lt;ref name=brophy1/&gt; Today the region is characterized by numerous [[archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;

== Early history ==
Although today the western Egyptian desert is totally dry, this was not always the case. There is good evidence that there were several humid periods in the past (when up to 500&amp;nbsp;mm of rain would fall per year), the most recent one during the last [[interglacial]] and early last glaciation periods which stretched between 130,000 and 70,000 years ago. During this time, the area was a [[savanna]] and supported numerous animals such as extinct buffalo and large giraffes, varieties of antelope and gazelle. Beginning around the [[10th millennium BC]], this region of the [[Nubian Desert]] began to receive more rainfall, filling a lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; Early people may have been attracted to the region due to the source of water..

[[Archaeological]] findings may indicate human occupation in the region dating to at least somewhere around the [[10th millennium BC|10th]] and [[8th millennium BC|8th millennia BC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; [[Fred Wendorf]], the site's discoverer, and ethno-linguist  [[Christopher Ehret]] have suggested that the people who occupied this region at that time were early pastoralists, or like the [[Sami people|Saami]] practiced semi-pastoralism (although this is disputed by other sources because the cattle remains found at Nabta have been shown to be morphologically wild in several studies, and nearby Saharan sites such as [[Uan Afada]] in Libya were penning wild [[Barbary sheep]], an animal that was never domesticated). The people of that time consumed and stored [[Sorghum leiocladum|wild sorghum]], and used [[ceramic]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; adorned by complicated [[paint]]ed patterns created perhaps by using [[comb]]s made from fish bone and which belong to a general pottery tradition strongly associated with the southern parts of the sahara (e.g., of the [[Khartoum]] mesolithic and various contemporary sites in [[Chad]]) of that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;  Analysis of human remains by Fred Wendorf and reported in &quot;Holocene Settlement of the Egyptian Sahara&quot;, based on [[Osteology|osteological]] data  suggests a subsaharan origin for the site's inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wendorf 2001 489–502&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Wendorf | first = Fred | last2 = Malville | first2 = J. McKim | editor-last = Wendorf | editor-first = Fred | editor2-last = Schild | editor2-first = Romuald | editor3-last = Nelson | editor3-first = Kit| year = 2001 | chapter = The Megalith Alignments | title = In Holocene Settlement of the Egyptian Sahara, vol. I,  The archaeology of Nabta Playa | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | place = New York | isbn = 0-306-46612-0 | pages = 489–502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}  Several scholars also support a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan linguistic affinity]] for the Nabta people; including Fred Wendorf and Christopher Ehret.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

By the [[7th millennium BC]], exceedingly large and organized [[town|settlements]] were found in the region, relying on deep [[water well|wells]] for sources of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; [[Hut]]s were constructed in straight [[wikt:row|row]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; Sustenance included [[fruit]], [[legume]]s, [[millet]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[tuber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;

Also in the late [[7th millennium BC]], but a little later than the time referred to above, imported [[goat]]s and [[sheep]], apparently from Western Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; appear. Many large [[hearth]]s also appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;

== Organization ==
[[Archaeological]] discoveries reveal that these [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples led livelihoods seemingly at a higher level of organization than their contemporaries who lived closer to the [[Nile|Nile Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; The people of Nabta Playa had above-ground and below-ground [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[construction]],
[[village]]s designed in pre-planned arrangements, and deep [[Water well|wells]] that held water throughout the year.

Findings also indicate that the region was occupied only seasonally, most likely only in the [[summer]] period, when the local lake filled with water for grazing [[cattle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; Comparative research indicated that the indigenous inhabitants may have a significantly more advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics than previously thought possible.

== Religious ties to ancient Egypt ==
By the [[6th millennium BC]], evidence of a prehistoric [[religion]] or [[cult]] appears, with a number of [[sacrifice]]d cattle buried in [[rock (geology)|stone]]-roofed chambers lined with [[clay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; It has been suggested that the associated [[Cattle in religion|cattle cult]] indicated in Nabta Playa marks an early evolution of [[Ancient Egypt]]'s [[Hathor]] [[cult (religious practice)|cult]]. For example, Hathor was worshipped as a nighttime protector in desert regions (see [[Serabit el-Khadim]]). To directly quote professors Wendorf and Schild:&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;
{{bquote|... there are many aspects of political and ceremonial life in [[prehistoric Egypt]] and the Old Kingdom that reflects a strong impact from [[Sahara]]n cattle [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]...}}

Nevertheless, though the religious practices of the region involving cattle suggest ties to [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt; Egyptologist [[Mark Lehner]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nubia&quot;/&gt; cautions:
{{bquote|It makes sense, but not in a facile, direct way. You can't go straight from these [[megalith]]s to the pyramid of [[Djoser]].}}

Other subterranean complexes are also found in Nabta Playa, one of which included evidence of what Wendorf described as perhaps &quot;the oldest known sculpture in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;WendorfSAA98&quot;/&gt;

== Possible use for astronomical observations ==
[[File:Calendar aswan.JPG|200px|thumb|Nabta Playa &quot;calendar circle&quot;, reconstructed at Aswan Nubia museum]]

By the [[5th millennium BC]] these peoples had fashioned what may be among the world's earliest known [[Archeoastronomy|archeoastronomical]] devices (roughly contemporary to the [[Goseck circle]] in Germany and the [[Mnajdra]] megalithic temple complex in Malta).  These include alignments of stones that may have indicated the rising of certain stars and a &quot;[[calendar]] circle&quot; that indicates the approximate direction of [[summer]] [[solstice]] sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malville_2015&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Malville | first = J. McKim | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = C.L.N. | editor-link = Clive Ruggles | title = Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy  | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media | volume = 2 | year = 2015 | chapter = Astronomy at Nabta Playa, Egypt | pages = 1079–1091 | isbn = 978-1-4614-6140-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Calendar circle&quot; may be a misnomer as the spaces between the pairs of stones in the gates are a bit too wide, and the distances between the gates are too short for accurate calendar measurements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wendorf 2001 489–502&quot;/&gt;  An inventory of Egyptian archaeoastronomical sites for the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] evaluated Nabta Playa as having &quot;hypothetical solar and stellar alignments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Juan Antonio | last = Belmonte | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive | editor-link = Clive Ruggles | editor2-last = Cotte | editor2-first = Michel | chapter = Ancient Egypt | title = Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention: A Thematic Study | year = 2010 | pages = 119–129 | place = Paris | publisher = [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] / [[International Astronomical Union]] | isbn = 978-2-918086-07-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims for early alignments and star maps===

Astrophysicist Thomas G. Brophy suggests the hypothesis that the southerly line of three stones inside the Calendar Circle represented the three stars of Orion’s Belt and the other three stones inside the calendar circle represented the shoulders and head stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as they appeared in the sky. These correspondences were for two dates—circa 4,800 BC and at precessional opposition—representing how the sky &quot;moves&quot; long term. Brophy proposes that the circle was constructed and used circa the later date, and the dual date representation was a conceptual representation of the motion of the sky over a precession cycle.

Near the Calendar Circle, which is made of smaller stones, there are alignments of large megalithic stones. The southerly lines of these megaliths, Brophy shows, aligned to the same stars as represented in the Calendar Circle, all at the same epoch, circa 6270 BC. The Calendar Circle correlation with Orion's belt occurred between 6400 BC and 4900 BC, matching the radio-carbon dating of campfires around the circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;brophy1&quot;/&gt;

==Recent research==

A 2007 article by a team of University of Colorado archaeoastronomers and archaeologists (three members had been involved in the original discovery of the site and its astronomical alignment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oldest Astronomical Megalith Alignment Discovered In Southern Egypt By Science Team | date = 1998-03-31 | publisher = University of Colorado | place = Boulder, CO | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/1998/03/31/oldest-astronomical-megalith-alignment-discovered-southern-egypt-science | last = Scott | first = J | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518031254/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/1998/03/31/oldest-astronomical-megalith-alignment-discovered-southern-egypt-science | archivedate = 2014-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has responded to the work of Brophy and Rosen, in particular their claims for an alignment with [[Sirius]] in 6088 and other alignments which they dated to 6270, saying that these dates were about 1500 years earlier than the estimated dates. The Sirius alignment in question was originally proposed by Wendorf and Malville,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wendorf 2001 489–502&quot;/&gt; for one of the most prominent alignments of megaliths labelled the &quot;C-line&quot;, which they said aligned to the rising of Sirius circa 4820 BC.  Brophy and Rosen showed in 2005 that megalith orientations and star positions reported by Wendorf and Malville were in error, noting that &quot;Given these corrected data, we see that Sirius actually aligned with the C line circa 6000 BC. We estimate that 6088 BC Sirius had a declination of -36.51 deg, for a rising azimuth exactly on the C-line average&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;brophy1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/maa_journal/issues/past%20issues/volume%205%20no1%20june%202005/brophy.pdf |last=Brophy |first=TG |author2=Rosen PA |title=Satellite Imagery Measures of the Astronomically Aligned Megaliths at Nabta Playa |journal=Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=15–24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229170244/http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/maa_journal/issues/past%20issues/volume%205%20no1%20june%202005/brophy.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Malville acknowledged the corrections made by Brophy and Rosen, but concluded the C-line of megaliths &quot;may not represent an original set of aligned stele; we refrain from interpreting that alignment.&quot;&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

They also criticised suggestions made by Brophy in his book ''The Origin Map'' that there was a representation of the [[Milky Way]] as it was in 17,500 BC and maps of Orion at 16500 BC, saying &quot;These extremely early dates as well as the proposition that the [[Ancient astronauts|nomads had contact with extraterrestrial life]] are inconsistent with the archaeological record. Inference in archaeoastronomy must always be guided and informed by archaeology, especially when substantial field work has been performed in the region.&lt;ref name = Malville2007&gt;{{cite journal | last=Malville | first = J McKim | author2=Schild, R. | author3=Wendorf, F. | author4=Brenmer, R | title=Astronomy of Nabta Playa | journal = African Skies/Cieux Africains | year=2007 | volume=11 | bibcode=2007AfrSk..11....2M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They propose that the area was first used as what they call a 'regional ceremonial centre' around 6100 to 5600 BC with people coming from various locations to gather on the dunes surrounding the playa where there is archaeological evidence for gatherings which involved large numbers of cattle bones, as cattle were normally only killed on important occasions. Around 5500 BC a new, more organised group began to use the site, burying cattle in clay-lined chambers and building other tumuli. Around 4800 BC a stone circle was constructed, with narrow slabs approximately aligned with the summer solstice, near the beginning of the rainy season.

More complex structures followed during a megalith period the researchers dated to between about 4500 BC to 3600 BC. Using their original measurements and measurements by satellite and GPS measurements by Brophy and Rosen they confirmed possible alignments with Sirius, [[Arcturus]], [[Alpha Centauri]] and the Belt of Orion.  They suggest that there are three pieces of evidence suggesting astronomical observations by the herdsmen using the site, which may have functioned as a [[necropolis]]. &quot;The repetitive orientation of megaliths, stele, human burials and cattle burials reveals a very early symbolic connection to the north.&quot; Secondly, there is the orientation of the cromlech mentioned above. The third piece of evidence is the fifth millennium alignments of stele to bright stars.&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

They conclude their report by writing that &quot;The symbolism embedded in the archaeological record of Nabta Playa in the Fifth Millennium BC is very basic, focussed on issues of major practical importance to the nomads: cattle, water, death, earth, sun and stars.&quot;&lt;ref name = Malville2007/&gt;

[[File:ISS013-E-44847.jpg|thumb|400px|Port Said and Suez Canal]]
'''Port Said''' ({{lang-arz|بورسعيد}} ''{{transl|arz|Borsaʿīd}}'' {{IPA-arz|boɾ.sæˈʕiːd, poɾ.sæˈʕiːd|IPA}}, the first syllable has its pronunciation from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; unurbanized local pronunciation: {{IPA-arz|bɔrsaˈʕɛˑd|}}) is a city that lies in north east [[Egypt]] extending about {{convert|30|km|mi}} along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], north of the [[Suez Canal]], with an approximate population of 603,787 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsaid.gov.eg/magals/ascan/Lists/List8/DispForm.aspx?ID=1|title=مؤشرات المجلس القومى للسكان - أهم المؤشرات السكانية لمحافظة بورسعيد - الأحداث...|website=Portsaid.gov.eg|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal.

Port Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the [[Human Development Index]] in 2009 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |title=Consejos para la vida - |publisher= |accessdate=23 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002181958/http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the economic base of the city is [[fishing]] and industries, like [[chemicals]], [[processed food]], and [[cigarettes]]. Port Said is also an important harbour for exports of Egyptian products like [[cotton]] and [[rice]], but also a fueling station for ships that pass through the Suez Canal. It thrives on being a [[duty-free]] port, as well as a tourist resort especially during summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsaid.gov.eg/tourism/default.aspx|title=الصفحة الرئيسية -السياحه|website=Portsaid.gov.eg|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the [[Lighthouse of Port Said]] (the first building in the world built from [[reinforced concrete]]).

There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is [[Port Fuad]], which lies on the eastern bank of the canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free [[Ferry|ferries]] running all through the day, and together they form a [[metropolitan area]] with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.  The only other metropolitan area in the world that also spans two continents is [[Istanbul]].

Port Said acted as a [[global city]] since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] community. Referring to this fact [[Rudyard Kipling]] once said &quot;If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of [[London]] and Port Said&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Port-Saïd : Architectures XIXe-XXe siècles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name of Port Said first appeared in 1855, It was chosen by an International committee composed of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont|Piedmont]]. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: [[Port]] (marine harbour) and [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] the concession to dig the Suez Canal{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Port Said}}
[[File:PORT-SAÏD -- De Lesseps monument (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|Ferdinand de Lesseps monument on the tourist jetty]]
[[File:Port-Said. Village Arabe.png|thumb|Postcard of the Arab quarter of Port Said]]
[[File:Port Said, The Office of the Suez Canal Company (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|250px|The office of the Suez Canal Company in Port Said built in 1893]]
Port Said was founded by [[Sa'id of Egypt]] on Easter Monday, April 25, 1859, when [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] gave the first symbolic swing of the pickaxe to signal the beginning of construction. The first problem encountered was the difficulty  for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden [[jetty]] was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

There were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the [[Sweet Water Canal]] could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or &quot;Beton Coignet&quot;, which was named after its inventor [[Francois Coignet]]. Artificial blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the [[lighthouse of Port Said]], the only original building still standing in Port Said.
In 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 — with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}} to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of [[Lake Manzala]] reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings, over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.

[[File:Map of Port Said (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|French map of Port Said, ca. 1914]]
At the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from [[Mataria]] started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to [[Cairo]]. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans &quot;of all nations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baedeker|first1=Karl|title=Indien. Handbuch für Reisende|date=1914|publisher=Karl Baedeker|location=Leipzig|page=5|language=German|quote=Die rasch anwachsende Zahl der Bewohner belief sich 1907 auf 50 000, darunter fast 11 000 Europäer aller Nationen, im übrigens Araber, Berber, Neger in buntem Gemisch.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the [[World War I]], the directors of the Suez Canal Company decided to create a new city on the Asian bank, building 300 houses for its labourers and functionaries. Port Fouad was designed by the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.

Since its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city.&lt;ref name=&quot;myportsaid.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225230/http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.

Since its establishment Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt. In 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]]. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. Following [[World War II]], Egypt denounced the Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Canal in 1951.

The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] occurred. Then in 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the [[Suez Crisis]]. The main battles occurred in Port Said, which played a historic role in the Suez Crisis. The withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on the 23rd of December 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On This Day: 1956: Jubilation as allied troops leave Suez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm|accessdate=18 October 2016|agency=BBC|date=December 23, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia.

After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the [[Six-Day War]], the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973).
The city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 603,787.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Port Said has a [[hot desert climate]] (BWh) according to [[Köppen climate classification]], but blowing winds from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] greatly moderates the temperatures, typical to the [[northern coast of Egypt]], making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters mild and moderately [[precipitation (meteorology)|wet]] when [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and [[hail]] are also common, yet less common than in [[Alexandria#Climate|Alexandria]] because Port Said is drier. January and February are the coolest months while the hottest are July and August.

The highest record temperature was {{convert|44|C}}, recorded on June 20, 1988, while the lowest record temperature was {{convert|0|C}}, recorded on December 25, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voodoo Skies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Port Said/El Gamil, Egypt|url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/port-saidel-gamil/monthly/temperature|publisher=Voodoo Skies|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Port Said, [[al-Qusayr, Egypt#Climate|Kosseir]], [[Ras El Bar#Climate|Ras El Bar]], [[Baltim#Climate|Baltim]], [[Damietta#Climate|Damietta]] and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]], additionally, [[Mersa Matruh#Climate|Mersa Matruh]] and Port Said have the coolest summer days of any other cities or resorts, although not significantly cooler than other northern coastal places.

By using the tributary, ships can enter the calmer waters of lake Tinnis before entering the Mediterranean proper to avoid rough waves, which was a huge problem for ships at that era shall they directly enter the sea, owing to the conditions at the mouth.The lake allows for boats to wait out rough conditions unlike at [[Damietta|Domyat]] or [[Rosetta|Rashid]] where the [[Nile]] empties directly into the sea, which makes it &quot;port of the lands of Byzantium, the Frankish periphery, Cyprus,the whole length of the Levant coast and the entrepôts of Iraq&quot; according to [[ibn Zulaq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt; The independent section given to it by ''The book of curiousities'', a set of important maps possibly made for caliph [[Al-Ma'mun|al‐Ma'mūn]] also testifies to its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johns|first1=Jeremy|last2=Savage‐Smith|first2=Emilie|title=The Book of Curiosities : A Newly Discovered Series of Islamic Maps|journal=Imago Mundi|date=1 October 2003|volume=55|issue=1|page=10|doi=10.1080/0308569032000095451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abandonment===
{{see also|Fifth crusade}}

The city's outward location, makes water difficult to come by , as well as cramped conditions are negatives. Moreover, its outward location meant difficulty defending it against seaborne enemies, especially the crusaders. In 1192-3 [[Saladin]] ordered the abandonment of the civic settlement, leaving only a military fort whilst commerce was moved to more defensible Domyat. Following the [[Siege of Damietta (1218–19)|siege]] of [[Damietta]], Egyptian authorities razed the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:The Masalla- Matarayyiah.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Mataria, with the Masalla [[Obelisk]] of [[Senusret I]].]]
'''Mataria''' ({{lang-ar|المطرية}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|el.mɑ.tˤɑ.ˈɾej.jɑ|pron}}) is a district in the northern region of [[Greater Cairo]], east of the [[Nile]], in [[Egypt]]. The district is unrelated to the coastal town in the [[Dakahlia Governorate]], that is also named [[El Matareya]]. The district's location was part of the ancient city of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], one of the oldest cities of [[ancient Egypt]].

== Name ==
The name, Mataria, (30° 7'46.08&quot;N  31°18'26.94&quot;E) is thought to come from the [[Latin]] word ''[[:wikt:mater#Latin|Mater]]'' which means 'mother', and is from the presence of the 'tree of the Virgin Mary' in this district.

== History ==
{{main|Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)}}
Mataria, with the nearby [[Ain Shams]] district, had a notable history during Egypt's [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic period]] as a part of ancient Heliopolis. The district has archaeological sites of the period, some only recently discovered, beneath its current structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;egipto&quot;&gt;[http://www.egiptomania.com/asade/novedades/descubrimientos4.htm Descubrimientos - Egipto  - Junio / Diciembre 2004; &quot;Pharonic tomb uncovered in Cairo, suburbs of Matareya&quot;]; August 26, 2004 . accessed 1.28.2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] times Heliopolis belonged to the [[Augustamnica]] province. Legend tells of the Christian [[Holy Family]] sheltering under a tree in Heliopolis, presently known as 'the tree of the [[Virgin Mary]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020324084755/http://www.st-mary-mons.org/english/holy_family_in_egypt.htm|title=Holy Family in Egypt|date=2002-03-24|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; now with the Chapel of the Virgin in Mataria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/egypt/el-matariya-egy-cai-elm.htm|title=15 Top Tourist Attractions in Cairo &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French naturalist [[Pierre Belon du Mans]] mentions visiting Mataria in his 1547 journey to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsvie.asso.fr/pdf/conferences/PlusHIVER2002conf.pdf ''Culture musulmane en Égypte (Suite)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912181726/http://www.artsvie.asso.fr/pdf/conferences/PlusHIVER2002conf.pdf |date=2008-09-12 }} Page 6. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mataria once had the [[villa]]s of prominent people. The famous Egyptian poet [[Ahmed Shawqi]] lived in a villa he named ‘Karmet Ibn Hani’ or Ibn Hani’s Vineyard كرمة ابن هانىء  here, near the palace of the Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] at Saray El-Qobba, until his exile from Egypt at [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Historic elements===
[[Image:Masalla Matarayyiah 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Masalla [[obelisk#Egyptian|Obelisk]], in Mataria.]]
The El Masalla area of the district contains the ancient Masalla [[obelisk#Egyptian|Obelisk]], or Misalla  ({{lang-ar|المسلة}}, trans. obelisk), one of the Pharaonic era obelisks that still remain in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-obelisk-egy-cai-obe.htm|title=15 Top Tourist Attractions in Cairo &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only surviving element of Heliopolis standing in its original position, and of the great Temple of [[Ra|Re]]—[[Atum]] constructed by Pharaoh [[Senusret I]] (1971 BCE—1926 BCE) of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/NUM_ORC/OBELISK_Gr_b3EXivrcos_diminutiv.html|title=OBELISK (Gr. b/3EXivrc... - Online Information article about OBELISK (Gr. b/3EXivrc...|website=encyclopedia.jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|68|ft|2|abbr=on}} tall red [[granite]] obelisk weighs 120 tons—{{convert|240,000|lb|kg}}.

A pink granite megalithic colossus statue, with features resembling those of the Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], was found in El Matareya in 2006, weighing five tons—{{convert|11,023|lb|kg}}. It was at the ruins of a sun temple dating back to the reign of Ramses II (reigned 1279 BCE—1213 BCE), at the site of later Souk El-Khamis.  

The underground tombs of [[High Priest of Re|High Priests of Re]] of the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] (2345 BCE—2181 BCE) were found in the southeast corner of the Re-Atum Temple archaeological site in El Matareya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-el-matariya-tombs-egy-cai-elmat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223101624/http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-el-matariya-tombs-egy-cai-elmat.htm |archivedate=2010-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Necropolis]] of Heliopolis,  {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of the Masalla obelisk in El Matareya, dates from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055 BCE—1550 BCE) and [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550 BCE—1069 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/cairo/heliopolis-necropolis-egy-cai-hnecro.htm|title=15 Top Tourist Attractions in Cairo &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A domed tomb made for a priest during the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] (c. 685 BCE—525 BCE), was discovered under a construction site in 2004. Many funereal small figure statues were found inside (over 400), and [[hieroglyph]]ic writing was on the tomb's walls from the 7th century [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;egipto&quot;/&gt;

In the incoherent district of El-Mataria, in Cairo, there stands an old sycamore tree that has been attracting thousands of pilgrims each Christmas, it's called the &quot;Virgin's Tree&quot;. There are many sacred trees in Egypt, trees that have offered shelter for the Holy Family during their stay here, but the one in Mataria holds the highest regard of all.

'''Maadi''' or '''al-Ma'adi''' ({{lang-ar|معادي الخبيري - المعادي}} / [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]: {{transl|ar|al-Ma‛adi}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|elmæˈʕæːdi|pron}}) is an affluent, leafy suburban district south of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] on the east bank of the [[Nile]] about 12&amp;nbsp;km upriver from downtown Cairo. The Nile at Maadi is parallelled by the [[Corniche]], a waterfront promenade and the main road north into Cairo. There is no bridge across the Nile at Maadi; the nearest one is located at [[El Mounib]] along the Ring Road (Tariq al-Da'iri) on the way north to the downtown.

Maadi's population was estimated to be 97,000 in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/areas/Lists/List1/DispForm.aspx?ID=43|title=الأحياء - حى المعادي|website=www.cairo.gov.eg|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the district is popular with many international expatriates as well as Egyptians and is home to a large number of embassies, as well as major international schools, sporting clubs, and cultural institutions such as the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] and the national [[Egyptian Geological Museum]]. (See below for details on embassies, schools, clubs, etc.)

==Name==
Ma'ǎdi معادي is the plural form of the Arabic word ma'diyya معدية, which means &quot;ferry&quot;; hence, al-Ma'adi literally means &quot;the ferries&quot;. There was a story that the name comes from a ferry crossing in the area where ferries carried people from the east side of the [[Nile]] to the west.

==History==
Maadi today stands on the site of a town that has turned out to be a significant [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]], Ancient Egyptian archaeological site, founded ca. 3500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/cities.htm|title=An Overview of the Cities and Towns of Ancient Egypt|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building activity in the area has destroyed some archaeologically sensitive places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/maadi.htm|title=Old Predynastic Maadi|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maadi traces its modern history to 1904, when the [[railway]] between Cairo to the north and [[Helwan]] to the south was built. This, in combination with land speculation by the Mosseri cousins and city planning by Alexander Adams, gave rise to a new town. Construction was originally limited to the area adjacent to the railway, but eventually spread west to the [[Nile]]. Also, a large British army camp was built east of the railway.

The [[town planning]] was done in 1905 by a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired officer Captain Alexander J. Adams. His vision led to the wide boulevards and large villas still seen in Maadi today. There were very strict rules associated with residential development in Maadi with regards to the size of houses, how much of the property could be occupied by the house and how much had to be left for the garden, and the size of the [[sidewalk]]s. Even window shutters had prescribed colours. Other regulations included wireless radio noise control after 22:00 and fines for not maintaining gardens properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The Electrical Experimenter, Volume 3.pdf|thumb|page=643|[[Frank Shuman|Shuman sunengine]] in Maadi on the March 1916 cover of [[The Electrical Experimenter]]]]
The world’s first solar thermal power station was built in Maadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Zachary Alden |author2=Taylor, Katrina D.|others= |title=Renewable and alternative energy resources: a reference handbook|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2008|page=174|isbn=978-1-59884-089-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maadi 1945.png|thumb|[http://digitalcollections.aucegypt.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15795coll6/id/202 Map of Maadi], 1945 from the Survey of Egypt]]

An example of [[British Empire|British colonial]] life in Maadi may be found in ''The house at Maadi'', a [[short story]] by [[Gerald Bullett]] from his collection ''The street of the eye'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Bullett 1971: 181ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
During the period between 1940 and 1946, Maadi had an important role in the [[Military history of New Zealand during World War II]]; around 76,000 members of the First Echelon, 2 NZEF (Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force) main body trained at a camp near Maadi at the base of the desert slopes of Wadi Degla and Tel al-Maadi. During that time this area belonged to the Delta Land Company which created Maadi in 1907. The rocky plateau was leased to the New Zealand Forces, and for the next six years became [[New Zealand]]'s main overseas base.

A [[British Army|British]] interrogation centre was also located in Maadi. In July 1942, at the height of the [[Western Desert Campaign]], two [[Wehrmacht|German]] spies revealed under questioning that they had been using a copy of [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s [[Rebecca (novel)|''Rebecca'']], found among their possessions, as a [[codebook]] for secret, coded radio transmissions. Their equipment, stored on a [[houseboat]] on the River Nile, had been examined by a young signals officer from the [[Egyptian army]], future [[President of Egypt|president]] [[Anwar Sadat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie1&quot;/&gt;

===Post-1952 Revolution===
Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]], after which the British colonial occupation ended, and the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], or Tripartite Aggression, in which Britain, France and Israel attacked Egypt to regain control of the Suez Canal, British and French expatriates living in Maadi and elsewhere were forced to leave Egypt. As a result, some of their institutions, such as St.John's Anglican Church, were taken over and run temporarily by other nationalities.

==Maadi today==
[[File:Maadi, Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|The Maadi Grand Mall]]
The oldest area in Maadi is El Sarayat, composed mostly of villas and low rise buildings. It is the most affluent part of Maadi along with the adjacent Degla area. These two areas are recognizable by the high number of roundabouts, quiet atmosphere and greenery.

There are many [[apartment|flat]] s in Maadi, mostly in [[lowrise]] buildings. There are several [[highrise]]s along the [[Corniche]] by the river, as well as in the newer, eastern part of Maadi, known as Degla.

The new Maadi areas include El-Laselky St. and the Autostrad, as well as Masaken El Arays, Saqr kuraish and the houses of the Kuwaiti company. It is characterized by the large number of oil companies, most notably the Gulf of Suez Oil Company, as well as some other companies.
The Arab region is also the most popular areas in Maadi and the Arab Maadi which is available from shops and crafts and various means of transport and its location, which connects all areas of Maadi.

Maadi is the least densely populated district in Greater Cairo, and much of it is inhabited by well-to-do Egyptians, as well as [[expatriate]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie1&quot;&gt;Beattie 2005: 183&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom are connected with embassies, ambassadorial residences and international corporations located in Maadi. The Cairo office for the [[USAID]] is also located in Maadi.

Many streets in Maadi continue to have [[speed bumps]] as a [[traffic calming]] measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie1&quot;/&gt;

===Atmosphere===
Maadi has a reputation for being green, quieter and more relaxed than urban Cairo. In some parts of Maadi, most notably around [[Cairo American College]], there is virtually no traffic noise. The abundant greenery bears little resemblance to most of the crowded areas seen in urban Cairo, and belies Maadi's original desert location. This reputation is true of the original core of Maadi and Degla; however, outlying developments such as &quot;New Maadi&quot; have brought in the same treeless neighborhoods and mundane architecture as found in much of the rest of Cairo's metropolitan sprawl.

===Economy and retail===
Along with its affluent residents, Maadi is home to many major restaurants, outlets and chains as well as a variety of high-end clothing shops, and other retail businesses, many of which are located along the locally famous &quot;Road 9&quot;, Nasr st, or new Maadi as well as Maadi's original &quot;downtown&quot; located just south of the Maadi Metro stop on the east side of the track.

[[Taisei Corporation]] has its North Africa office in Maadi.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.taisei.co.jp/english/profile/over_net.html Overseas Offices].&quot; Taisei Corporation. Retrieved on February 20, 2012. &quot;NORTH AFRICA OFFICE 25th, Rd. No.10, Station Sqr, Maadi, Cairo, ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
Maadi is served by the [[Cairo Metro]]'s Line 1, which has now taken over the Cairo-to-Helwan railway. There are three stops in Maadi - from north to south: Hadayek El Maadi, Maadi and Sakanat (Thakanat) El Maadi. Further metro construction in Maadi is foreseen, but nothing is beyond the proposal stage as yet.

[[Egyptian National Railways]] also operates a line through Maadi, but it is strictly a freight line. There is no longer any passenger service; the station is closed.

===Nature protected areas in Maadi===
* Wadi Degla Protected Area
* Protected fossil trees

===Culture===
Cultural life in Maadi is geared to a great extent towards serving the large expatriate and affluent, bilingual Egyptian populations. For expatriates, Maadi offers a variety of community activities: religious institutions (many churches and a synagogue), amateur theatre groups,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beattie1&quot;/&gt; sporting clubs, adult courses, and other interest groups.  The Maadi Sporting Club, for example, has served the local expat and Egyptian communities since 1921. Maadi has also become a popular place for foreigners to study [[Arabic]], as the suburb now hosts a number of local language schools.

Cultural venues include the new [[Egyptian Geological Museum]] and the large [[Maadi Library]].

Cultural life, locally, largely revolves around dining out and shopping. In addition to numerous Western restaurant chains and cafés, Maadi offers a variety of international cuisine. The most popular places for westerners to shop at &quot;local&quot; stores is along Road 9.  There are also international and multilingual bookshops selling foreign newspapers and magazines catering to Maadi's multi-ethnic population.

===Sport===
During [[World War II]] members of the 2nd NZEF based at [[Maadi Camp]] in Egypt competed in [[regatta]]s on the Nile against local Egyptian rowing clubs. At a regatta held on 20 November 1943 the Maadi Camp Rowing Club &quot;Kiwi&quot; oarsmen beat the Cairo River Club by 11 points to six to win the [[Freyberg Cup]], which they then gifted to the competitors. In return, as a token of friendship, [[Youssef Bahgat]] presented the Kiwis with a cup.

[[Youssef Bahgat]]'s cup was offered to the NZARA (now NZRA) as a trophy for an annual boys' eight-oared race between secondary schools and was brought to [[New Zealand]] at the end of the war. Renamed the [[Maadi Cup]] it was first raced for in 1947 at Wanganui where it was won by Mt Albert Grammar. The Maadi Cup gained its native timber pyramid shaped base from Mt Albert Grammar's woodwork master, Jack Jenkin, in 1951.

The Maadi Sporting Club and Yacht, founded in 1920 by British expatriates who mainly worked at the Delta Real Estate Company, today offers a range of sports, such as Tennis, Football, Swimming, Squash, handball, hockey, Judo, Table Tennis, Sailing, and Rowing.

Victory College is no longer the home of a men's and women's softball league as well as a men's rugby league.  Softball has not been played since 2015 and rugby ceased to be played in 2003.

Maadi is also famous of biking, rollerblading and jogging, in Maadi you can safely ride your bike or jog specially in the morning and enjoy the peace and green landscape better than any other district in Egypt

The '''Theban Necropolis''' is a [[necropolis]] on the west bank of the [[Nile]], opposite [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] ([[Luxor]]) in [[Upper Egypt]]. It was used for ritual burials for much of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic]] period, especially during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]].

'''El Hiba''' (alt. '''el-Hibeh'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] الحيبة) is the modern name of the [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] city of '''Tayu-djayet''' (''t3yw-ḏ3yt''), an ancient nickname meaning &quot;their walls&quot; in reference to the massive enclosure walls built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kitchen |first=Ken | title=The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC), 2nd edition|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd. |location=Warminster, England| page= 269 |year=1986 |isbn=0-85668-298-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Coptic language|Coptic]], it was known as ''Teudjo'', and during the [[Graeco-Roman]] Period, it was called Ankyronpolis. In antiquity, the city was located in the 18th Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]], and today it is found in the [[Bani Suwayf]] governorate.

==History==
From the late [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th Dynasty]] to the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]], Tayu-djayet was a frontier town, marking the division of the country between the [[High Priests of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the [[Pharaoh|kings]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]. A massive enclosure wall was built at the site, with bricks stamped with the names of the High Priests [[Pinedjem I]] and [[Menkheperre]]. Earlier, the High Priest [[Herihor]] also lived and operated from al-Hibah. During the 22nd Dynasty, king [[Shoshenq I]] built a temple dedicated to &quot;Amun-Great-of-Roarings&quot; at the site, complete with a topographical list of cities captured during his &quot;First Campaign of Victory&quot; in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]; the temple is also decorated by his son, [[Osorkon I]]. The ancient settlement is at {{coord|28|47|14|N|30|55|16|E}} a little to the North of the modern town.

==Today==
Since 2001, El Hibeh has been the focus of ongoing excavations by a team of [[U.C. Berkeley]] [[archaeologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nes.berkeley.edu/hibeh/index.htm|title=U.C. Berkeley Excavations at El Hibeh|website=nes.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to instability as a result of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]], [[Looting|looters]] have been allowed to systematically plunder the site, digging hundreds of pits, exposing tombs, destroying walls, and leaving human remains strewn about the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalheritagenetwork.ning.com/profiles/blogs/extensive-looting-at-el-hibeh-egypt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/337119989673652/|title=Save El Hibeh Egypt|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Madi''' is a cluster of [[prehistoric]], [[Neolithic]] [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] mounds in Southern [[Sinai]], Egypt. It is located east of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the bottom of a [[granite]] ridge. It was suggested to have been a seasonal encampment for groups of [[hunter gatherers]] and contained the remains of two major [[Human settlement|settlement]]s; '''Abu Madi I''' and '''Abu Madi III'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-YosefTchernov1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ofer Bar-Yosef|author2=Eitan Tchernov|author3=Avi Gopher|title=An early neolithic village in the Jordan Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvPgAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University|isbn=978-0-87365-547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiebert1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fredrik Talmage Hiebert|title=Origins of the Bronze Age oasis civilization in Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkMSAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=1994|publisher=Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University|isbn=978-0-87365-545-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abi Madi I is a small site with the remains of a partially buried {{convert|4|m|ft}} building containing deposits up to a depth of {{convert|1.3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Review of archaeology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Review of archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ly0AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=1991|publisher=Review of Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Madi III was an area of roughly {{convert|20|m2|ft2}} that was excavated close to a large nearby boulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clutton-BrockGrigson1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juliet Clutton-Brock|author2=Caroline Grigson|author3=International Council for Archaeozoology|author4=University of London.

==Culture==
The culture has been referred to as the '''Abu Madi Entity''' as it shows evidence of having retained [[Natufian]] characteristics of a temporary settlement, while being at least partly contemporary with the [[PPNA]] cultures of the Levant further to the North. It has been dated approximately 10100 to 9700 [[Before Present|BP]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuijt2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Kuijt|title=Life in Neolithic farming communities: social organization, identity, and differentiation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kz79KLC6yLoC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46122-4|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from between 9660 to 9180 [[Before Christ|BC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoriente.org/associated_projects/ppnd_site.php?s=3#FN1|title=exoriente e.V. - PPND (neolithic radiocarbon dates) - Site|last=Forster|first=ex oriente e.V. &amp; Marion Benz &amp; datalino, Christoph|website=www.exoriente.org|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with calibrated datings ranging between c. 9750 and 7760 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://context-database.uni-koeln.de/c14.php?vonsite=14|title=radiocarbon CONTEXT database|last=ITmatters.de|first=Steffen Steiner -|website=context-database.uni-koeln.de|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging by these [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]], Abu Madi has been suggested to be a form of late [[Khiamian]] culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;CauvinWatkins2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacques Cauvin|author2=Trevor Watkins|title=The birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4epGQpNyucC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65135-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the dwellings found housed small groups of [[nuclear families]] continuing in the [[Natufian]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocquet-AppelBar-Yosef2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Pierre Bocquet-Appel|author2=Ofer Bar-Yosef|title=The Neolithic Demographic Transition and Its Consequences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMUxhfRImBIC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8538-3|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of chipped flints were recovered including a new type of [[aerodynamic]] [[arrowhead]] known as the '''Abu Madi Point''' characterised by elongated [[oval]]s or [[rhomboid]] shapes, occasionally with a small [[Tang (tools)|tang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar-YosefTchernov1997&quot;/&gt; [[El Khiam]] points were also found with deep concave bases&lt;ref&gt;Gopher Avi. , Bar-Yosef Ofer. , Nadel D.,  Early Neolithic arrowhead types in the Southern Levant : a typological suggestion, Paléorient, Volume 17, Number 17-1, pp. 109–11, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested these arrowheads were used to hunt such animals as [[gazelles]] and wild [[ibex]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerusalem2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem|title=Levant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4J8sAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 March 2011|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Madi has been suggested to be amongst the ten probable centers for the [[origin of agriculture]] and used in [[statistical analysis]] to determine the rate of spread into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030410 Pinhasi R, Fort J, Ammerman AJ., Tracing the Origin and Spread of Agriculture in Europe.

The '''Speos Artemidos''' (''Grotto of Artemis'') is an archaeological site in [[Egypt]]. It is located about 2&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] tombs at [[Beni Hasan]], and about 28&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Al Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]]. Today, the site is a small village known as '''Istabl Antar'''.

There are two [[Egyptian temple|temples]] here, both of which are dedicated to [[Pakhet]]. They are cut out of the rock into the cliffs on the eastern side of the [[Nile]]. One of the temples, built by Queen [[Hatshepsut]], has an [[architrave]] bearing a long dedicatory text with her famous denunciation of the [[Hyksos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HSA&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070403234933/http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html Speos Artemidos Inscription of Hatshepsut], based on the work of James P. Allen&lt;/ref&gt; nearby also exist a small shrine of [[Alexander II of Macedon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=Speos+Artemidos+archeology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nd4v5362jS&amp;sig=6gQEo82kKhcUP4NCbTGaBhPz_lU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Speos%20Artemidos%20archeology&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|last=Kipfer|first=Barbara Ann|date=2000-04-30|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306461583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier temple was probably located here, but no traces older than that of [[Hatshepsut]] have been found. The decorations inside have been usurped by [[Seti I]] in places, his name replacing that of [[Hatshepsut]].

[[Cut from the living rock]], Hatshepsut's temple is composed of two chambers connected by a short passageway. The outer portico is rectangular and originally had eight stone columns arranged in two rows Unfortunately, only three of the four columns forming the facade are still relatively intact and none of the internal pillars remain. The rock face above the external pillars of the portico is dressed and inscribed with text bearing Hatshesput's name. It includes the famous text in which she denounces the Hyksos and records her actions in rebuilding the damage they had caused thus legitimising her own reign. Within the portico only the southern wall bears any inscription. The text originally referred to Hatshepsut but was usurped by Seti I who also added further dedications.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG&quot;&gt;p12-13 Fairman, H.W and Grdseloff, B (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller inner sanctuary is square with a statue niche at the back. It was not inscribed by Hatshepsut and Brand has suggested that it was in fact Seti who first excavated the passageway and sanctuary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand&quot;&gt;P54 Brand (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Seti altered the text to replace Hatshepsut's name with his own and changed representations of the Queen to depictions of himself, but Fairman and Grdseloff argued that there was no clear evidence that [[Tuthmosis III]] defaced the chapel when he was expunging her name from other monuments late in his reign despite the existence of his name on some of the pillars of the portico. This conclusion is queried by Brand who suggests that an image of the queen had been vandalised by Tuthmosis and later recarved to depict Seti. Likewise Fairman and Grdseloff did not find evidence that [[Akhenaten]] had defaced the name of Amun but Brand concluded that Seti had repaired this damage and notes at least one instance where an earlier version of one of the arms of [[Amun]] was still visible. Brand notes that Seti also replaced an image of a priest with that of the god [[Thoth]] and concludes that this was the result of the increasing influence of this god's temple in Hermopolis during the reign of Seti. Finally Brand notes that Seti added three scenes to the depictions of the coronation of Hatshepsut but (contrary to Fairman and Grdseloff) found no evidence that he had usurped these scenes from Hatshepsut.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGBrand&quot;&gt;Fairman and Grdseloff 1947:13, Brand 2000:55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tod Treasure===
[[File:Louvre 122006 043.jpg|thumb|Tod Treasure on display at [[the Louvre]]]]
In 1936, archaeologists digging at the temple location found in the support structures under the ruined building a number of metallic and lapis lazuli artifacts. The objects were made largely of silver. They were earmarked for some authorities of unknown origin and epoch, who are believed to have been of non-Egyptian origin. Nevertheless, the style of the objects resemble artifacts that were excacated in [[Knossos]], which date to c. 1900–1700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;According to P-B Geneviève of the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at Knossos such objects were made of clay, possibly imitating metal.

The initial discovery of four chests (inscribed with the name of pharaoh [[Amenemhat II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Roger Moorey&quot;/&gt;) made of copper and containing the objects had been made by [[Fernand Bisson de la Roque|F. Bisson de la Roque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEWS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierrat-Bonnefois Geneviève, [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/three-cups-tod-treasure Louvre Museum website.] Musée du Louvre, Multimedia Division, Cultural Production, Department 75058, Paris, Cedex 01,France [Retrieved 2011-12-13]. Also see at [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/tod-treasure the Louvre Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources posit that the treasure is of Asiatic origin and that some of it, in fact, was manufactured in Iran (the latter as claimed by ''Roger Moorey'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Roger Moorey&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=P.R.S.|last=Moorey|authorlink=Roger Moorey|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Tod+Treasure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bwAuIhD0RE&amp;sig=DIBjnT2q858NvX_cfXGtWMb2to4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iHXnTpOrGsP44QS_84jaCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Tod%20Treasure&amp;f=false| title = Ancient mesopotamian materials and industries: the archaeological evidence (415 pages) | publisher =  ''Eisenbrauns'', 1999 {{ISBN|1-57506-042-6}} | accessdate = 2011-12-13}} [[cf.]] E. Porada, (1982)  “Remarks on the Tod Treasure in Egypt,”&lt;/ref&gt; Some gold artifacts are also part of the Treasure, and they may have originated from [[Anatolia]].

Nicholson, Ian Shaw [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7A9jJrZP0C&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=Ptolemaic-Roman+additions+to+El-Tod&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zs_0mnyJHr&amp;sig=po_GQZCt1TE434PEfMhuBLuXB_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qibvTtuQHc-D8gOEtZH3CQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Ptolemaic-Roman%20additions%20to%20El-Tod&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk] ''Ancient Egyptian materials and technology'' (702 pages) Cambridge University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-521-45257-0}},[Retrieved 2011-12-19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.R.Maxwell-Hyslop (''citing'' [[Edith Porada|E.Porada]]) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3642923 JSTOR]''A Note on the Anatolian Connections of the Tôd Treasure Anatolian Studies'' Vol. 45, (1995), pp. 243-250 (article consists of 8 pages) Published by: British Institute at Ankara [Retrieved 2011-12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects that were found as part of the Treasure seem to have originated from various parts of the world, indicating trade contacts between the Ancient Egyptians and other early civilizations.

The total weight of all gold items was 6.98&amp;nbsp;kg, and of the silver items 8.87&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient-egypt.co.uk/tod/pages/el-Tod,%20treasure.htm|title=Ancient Egypt and Archaeology Web Site - The Tod Treasure|website=www.ancient-egypt.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discovery, the Treasure was divided between the [[Louvre Museum]] and the [[Egyptian Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12495">'''Tell el-Dab'a''' is a archaeological site in the [[Nile delta]] region of [[Egypt]] where [[Avaris]], the capital city of the [[Hyksos]], once stood. Avaris was occupied by Asiatics from the end of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th]] through the [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|13th dynasty]] (early second millennium BC). The site is known primarily for its [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] frescoes.

[[File:Tell el-daba04.jpg|thumb|Tell el-Dab'a, Egypt.]]

==Identification of the site==

Excavations in the area were started in 1885 by [[Édouard Naville]].
Between 1929 and 1939, [[Pierre Montet]] excavated at [[Tanis]], 20km to the north, finding remarkably rich tombs. He believed that he found the location of Avaris, and his opinion was widely accepted at the time.
Yet others, such as [[Labib Habachi]], one of the pioneering Egyptian Egyptologists, were not convinced. In 1941-42 he excavated at Tell el-Dab'a for the [[Egyptian Antiquities Service]] and came to the conclusion that this was in fact Avaris:

{{quotation|When a detailed study of the topography of the site and its surroundings was made by [[Manfred Bietak]] of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in the 1980s, Habachi's hypothesis was confirmed. Bietak's mission revealed that the actual [[Hyksos]] capital was indeed Tell al-Dab'a.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Kamil, [http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=L9uwmW4vUUAC&amp;pg=PA77 ''Labib Habachi: The Life and legacy of an Egyptologist.''] American University in Cairo Press, 2007 p.77 {{ISBN|9774160614}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent investigations of cemeteries at Avaris have been conducted as part of thirty years of joint excavations by the Austrian Archaeological Institute of Cairo, led by [[Manfred Bietak]], and since October 2010 by [[Irene Forstner-Müller]]. An interesting thrust of the latest investigations has to do with the historic epidemic at Avaris in 1715 BC, documented in archaeology and surviving papyrus.{{Citation_needed|date=January 2013}}

The nature of civilization at Tell el-Dab’a is understood from archaeological examination of the site. Excavations have discovered buildings, namely residences, tombs, and temples, that combine Egyptian and Canaanite architectural styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Booth |first=Charlotte |title=''The Hyksos Period in Egypt'' |year=2005 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Princes Risborough |isbn=0-7478-0638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society of Tell el-Dab’a interacted with individuals from other regions who influenced their frescos.&lt;ref name =&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Nancy R. |title=[https://www.academia.edu/3717192/The_Early_Mycenaean_Lion_Up_to_Date The Early Mycenaean Lion up to Date] |year=2004 |publisher=''Hesperia Supplements''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the remains have been damaged by the marshy environment as well as by the continual rebuilding and agriculture on the site, archeologists have shown that this city was occupied by a wealthy society with a large sacred precinct and unusual burial practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

From 1951 to 1954, Shehata Adam partly excavated the 12th Dynasty site of Ezbet Rushdi near Tell El-Dab'a.

==Architecture==

===Residences===
Tell el-Dab’a experienced an increase in immigration during the period 1610-1590 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Between 1590 and 1570 BCE, the population of Tell el-Dab’a faced overcrowding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Due to space restrictions, small houses were built in cemeteries, and children were buried in the doorways of larger houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Tombs became incorporated into the structure of the houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

During the early Hyksos period, members of lower social classes built their houses around their master’s house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; This is not as evident during the later Hyksos Period due to the overcrowding and damage caused by agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; The size of the houses of Tell el-Dab’a indicates the affluence of the inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; In the north-east periphery area, the houses were very small, reflecting poorer classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; In contrast, in the eastern area of Tell el-Dab’a, the remains of large houses with stairs leading to upper floors were discovered, indicating that the more wealthy members of the society lived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

Towards the end of the Hyksos period, between 1600 and 1570 BCE, the rulers of Tell el-Dab’a felt threatened by the possibility of attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; They therefore built a thick enclosure wall around the city for defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

===Tombs===
The tomb styles and methods used to bury the dead in Tell el-Dab’a were Canaanite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authors=Freedman, David, Allen Meyers, and Astrid Beck |title=''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' |year=2000 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|location=Grand Rapids |isbn=0-8028-2400-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tombs consist of vaulted mud-brick chambers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedman&quot;/&gt; They reflect the belief in the afterlife of the inhabitants of Tell el-Dab’a, similar to that of the Egyptians. Grave goods were often buried with the bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Servant and donkey burials are recognized as remarkable burial practices of Tell el-Dab’a.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; The servant and donkey burials were practiced between 1680 and 1660 BCE. They were most popular during the period of Asiatic immigration at the beginning of the Hyksos reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; 

The servants were not buried in the same manner as the tomb owners: the servants were buried at a different orientation in the tomb in order to show their position in the hierarchy of Tell el-Dab’a.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; They were buried across the tomb entrance, facing the door.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; This is interpreted as the servants waiting for the instructions of the tomb masters, which would be a component of the ideal life in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Three servant burials have been found at Tell el-Dab’a. The servants appear to have been buried at the same time as the tomb owners during a servant sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

The donkey burials took place throughout the history of Tell el Dab’a. The donkeys were generally found in pairs in front of the tombs at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; The donkeys may have been sacrificed when the tomb owner died as they were both buried at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; The donkeys emphasize the society’s belief in the afterlife: donkeys were closely associated with expeditions and could thus be connected with the journey between life and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

===Temples===
Excavations at Tell el-Dab’a have uncovered temples that date to the Hyksos period. The temples exhibit Egyptian and Canaanite styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; By convention, the entrances of the temples are in the north wall and the temples are orientated NNW-SSE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; Items such as bronze daggers, ax heads, and jugs have been found at these complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freedman&quot;/&gt;

The most noteworthy temple is Temple I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; It is in the Egyptian style and dates to between 1680 and 1660 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; It contains three sanctuaries and in its courtyard, there is evidence of an altar upon which sacrifices may have been made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt; The outside walls were made of mud-brick that was whitewashed. Traces of blue paint have been found on the walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;

In 1987, thousands of fragments of Minoan wall paintings were discovered in the ancient gardens that adjoin the palace complex of Tell el-Dab’a, on the site of a fortress of the early New Kingdom.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gates&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Charles |title=The Adoption of Pictorial Imagery in Minoan Wall Painting: A Comparativist Perspective |year=2004 |publisher=''Hesperia Supplements''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments show techniques, subjects, and styles that are characteristic of Minoan frescos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates&quot;/&gt; The frescos were applied as ''[[buon fresco]]'', a defining aspect of Minoan works.&lt;ref name =&quot;Nicholson and Shaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authors=Nicholson, Paul T. and Ian Shaw |title=''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology'' |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45257-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include scenes of maze-like patterns, bulls and bull-leapers, the flying gallop, griffins, and leopard and lion hunts, images associated with the Minoan artistic culture. The Minoan wall paintings from Tell el-Dab’a therefore show that the early &lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bietak's report on Tell el-Dab'a&lt;/ref&gt;18th dynasty rulers were open to works and themes from the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name =&quot;Kristiansen and Larsson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kristiansen, Kristian and Thomas Larsson |title=''The Rise of Bronze Age Society: Travels, Transmissions and Transformations'' |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-84363-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyksos and Minoan societies were in contact, potentially through itinerant artists who transferred Minoan technology to Tell el-Dab’a. The population of Tell el-Dab’a may have also included Aegean families, resulting in direct connections between Aegean and Egyptian art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;

The bull-leaping scenes depicted on the fresco fragments are considered to be indistinguishable from those found in Minoan palaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristiansen and Larsson&quot;/&gt; The theme of bull leaping is identified in particular with Knossos, Crete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates&quot;/&gt; The fresco was painted in the Minoan bull-leaping fresco style: a dark-skinned individual with dark, wavy hair wearing Minoan-style clothing, namely the kilt, boots, and armbands, is depicted performing a flip over a bull’s back.

Nanno Marinatos tentatively formed a two-fold scene of the lion and leopard hunting fragments in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; Leopards are depicted hunting deer against a red background in the upper scene of the fresco while lions chasing an ibex is illustrated in the lower region. Other fragments show boots. It was thus deduced that a hunting scene was depicted. In addition, Bietak included a photograph of a leopard in his work that shows its rear parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The animal’s legs and tail are fully extended in the flying gallop pose in order to show motion, a common representational technique of Minoan art.

===Cypriot Pottery===
Approximately 500 pieces of Cypriot pottery, containing oil and perfume, were discovered at Tell el-Dab’a. Pendent Line, Cross Line, and White Painted V styles of White Painted Cypriot pottery compose the largest component of exported pottery to Tell el-Dab’a, indicating that Tell el-Dab’a had trade relations with Cyprus.&lt;ref name =&quot;Barlow&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authors=Barlow, Jane, Diane Bolger, and Barbara Kling |title=''Cypriot Ceramics: Reading the Prehistoric Record'' |year=1991 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-924171-10-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the exported pieces were of the “broad band” tradition.&lt;ref name =&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt; A single rim fragment from a jar of the White Painted V Fine Line Style was found at the site.&lt;ref name =&quot;Barlow&quot;/&gt;

The Hyksos citadel must have been constructed towards the end of the Hyksos Period (ph. D/2), as fragments of [[Cypriot Bichrome Ware]] have been found in sand dumps deposited in order to raise the land for the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bietak, [http://www.auaris.at/html/ez_helmi_en.html The Palatial Precinct at the Nile Branch (Area H)] auaris.at&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ezbet Rushdi==
Ezbet Rushdi is a small village about 1 km north-east of Tell el-Daba. A [[Temple of Ezbet Rushdi|temple]] and a settlement of the Middle Kingdom period have been discovered there by recent excavations.

Previously excavated by Shehata Adam, who discovered a temple east of the village, the Austrian Archaeological Institute re-excavated the site in 1996. It was discovered that, prior to the construction of the temple, there was already an early 12th dynasty settlement there.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Czerny, [http://www.auaris.at/html/ezbet_en.html Ezbet Rushdi] www.auaris.at&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2399">'''Nitria''' is one of the earliest Christian monastic sites in Egypt.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; It was the earliest of the three major centers of Christian monastic activity in the [[Nitrian Desert]], the other two were [[Kellia]] and [[Scetis]].&lt;ref name=bagnall&gt;Roger S. Bagnall, etc. ''Egypt from Alexander to the early Christians: An Archaeological and Historical Guide'', Getty Publications, 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ig4uQC20_IC&amp;pg=PA108 pg. 108-112]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nitria was founded in AD 330 by [[Saint Amun|Ammon]] and quickly attracted thousands of monks through the remainder of the 4th century.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; By 390, it evolved from a loose collection of solitary monks to an organized community with bankers, merchants and church services.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Tourists from the nearby city of [[Alexandria]] came as well, even in large numbers, and many of the monks focused on servicing the tourists needs.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Other monks sought more remote areas, away from the tourists and merchants, and established a monastic center in Kellia twelve miles distant, in 338. The monastic population in Nitria declined during the fifth and sixth centuries and the site was abandoned sometime in the middle of the seventh century.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; 

Little remains today at its location near or under the modern village of [[Al Barnuji]].&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt; Nitria should not be confused with the monasteries at [[Wadi El Natrun]] (formally known as Scetis), which are still in existence. Nitria was named for a nearby town which took its name from the deposits of nearby [[natron]], a salt used by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians in the [[embalming]] of mummies.&lt;ref name=bagnall/&gt;

'''Thinis''' or '''This''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: '''Tjenu''') was the [[capital city]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|first dynasties]] of [[ancient Egypt]].  Thinis is, as yet, [[Lost city|undiscovered]] but well attested to by ancient writers, including the classical historian [[Manetho]], who cites it as the centre of the [[Thinite Confederacy]], a tribal confederation whose leader, [[Menes]] (or [[Narmer]]), united [[Egypt]] and was its first [[pharaoh]]. Thinis began a steep decline in importance from [[Dynasty III]], when the capital was relocated to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].  Its location on the border of the competing [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolitan]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] dynasties of the [[First Intermediate Period]], and its proximity to certain [[Oasis|oases]] of possible military importance, ensured Thinis some continued significance in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New]] Kingdoms. This was a brief respite and Thinis eventually lost its position as a regional administrative centre by the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]].

Due to its ancient heritage, Thinis remained a significant religious centre, housing the tomb and [[mummy]] of the regional deity.  In ancient Egyptian [[religious cosmology]], as seen (for example) in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', Thinis played a role as a mythical place in [[heaven]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;&gt;Massey 1907: 637&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the precise location of Thinis is unknown, mainstream [[Egyptology|Egyptological]] consensus places it in the vicinity of ancient [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and modern [[Girga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner1&quot;&gt;Gardiner 1964: 430 n.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt1&quot;&gt;Ryholt 1997: 163 n. 594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strudwick1&quot;&gt;Strudwick 2005: 509&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and location==
The name ''Thinis'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Θίνις) is derived from [[Manetho]]'s use of the adjective ''Thinite'' to describe the pharaoh [[Menes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Verb&quot;&gt;Verbrugghe and Wickersham 2001: 131&lt;/ref&gt; Although the corresponding ''Thinis'' does not appear in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], it is demanded by the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] original&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner1&quot;/&gt; and is the more popular name among Egyptologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnall&quot;/&gt;  Also suggested is ''This'' (Θίς).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacoma&quot;&gt;Tacoma 2006: 54 n. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

In correcting a passage of [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]] (b. 490 BCE), [[Jörgen Zoega]] amended
Τίνδων ὄνομα to Θὶν δὲ ᾧ ὄνομα.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero2&quot;/&gt; [[Gaston Maspero|Maspero]] (1903) found that this revealed the name ''Thinis'' and also, from the same passage, a key geographic indicator: επιποταμίη ({{lang-en|on the river}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero2&quot;/&gt; Maspero used this additional detail to support the theory, which included among its followers [[Jean-François Champollion]] and [[Nestor L'Hôte]], locating Thinis at modern-day Girga or a neighbouring town, possibly El-Birba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero2&quot;/&gt; Other proposals for Thinis' location have lost favour at the expense of the Girga-Birba theory: [[Auguste Mariette]], founder director of the [[Egyptian Museum]], suggested [[Kom el-Sultan]]; A. Schmidt, El-Kherbeh; and [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch]], [[Johannes Dümichen]] and others&lt;ref&gt;Moldenke 2008: 89&lt;/ref&gt; supported El-Tineh, near Berdis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero2&quot;&gt;Maspero 1903: 331 n.1&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream Egyptological consensus continues to locate Thinis at or near to either Girga,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryholt1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strudwick1&quot;/&gt; or El-Birba&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnall&quot;&gt;Bagnall 1996: 334&lt;/ref&gt; (where an inscribed statue fragment mentioning Thinis is said to have been found).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson2&quot;&gt;Wilkinson 2000: 354&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Osireion.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Nearby [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (''[[Osireion]] pictured''), after ceding its political rank to Thinis, remained an important religious centre.]]

===Pre-dynastic and Early Dynastic periods===
Although the archaeological site of Thinis has never been located,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;Anderson 1999: 105&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of population concentration in the [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]-Thinis region dates from the fourth millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patch 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Thinis is also cited as the earliest royal [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|burial-site]] in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark 2004: 115&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early point, the city of Abydos resigned its political rank to Thinis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero4&quot;/&gt; and although Abydos would continue to enjoy supreme religious importance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero4&quot;&gt;Maspero 1903: 333&lt;/ref&gt; its history and functions cannot be understood without reference to Thinis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson2&quot;/&gt; The role of Thinis as centre of the [[Thinite Confederacy]] (or Dynasty 0) and into the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] (specifically [[First dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty I]] and [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty II]])&lt;ref&gt;Lesley 1868: 154&lt;/ref&gt; is taken from Manetho,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson 2000: 67&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Wilkinson (2000), seems to be confirmed by Dynasty I and late Dynasty II royal tombs at Abydos, the principal regional [[necropolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;/&gt;

===Old Kingdom===
[[File:Mentuhotep Seated edit.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Mentuhotep II]], pharaoh of the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XI]], finally brought Thinis under Theban sway during his campaign of reunification.]]
Such importance seems to have been short-lived: certainly, the national political role of Thinis ended at the beginning of [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty III]] (c. 2686 BCE),&lt;ref name=&quot;Naj&quot;/&gt; when [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] became the chief religious and political centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=The Lost City of Thinis, First Capital of a United Egypt|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-africa/lost-city-thinis-first-capital-united-egypt-009807|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Naj&quot;&gt;Najovits 2003: 171&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Thinis retained its regional significance: during [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty V]], it was the probable seat of the &quot;[[Overseer of Upper Egypt]]&quot;, an administrative official with responsibility for the Nile Valley south of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]],&lt;ref&gt;Bard 1999: 38&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]] it was the eponymous capital of ''[[nome (Egypt)|nome]]'' VIII of Upper Egypt and seat of its [[nomarch]].

During the wars of the [[First Intermediate Period]] (c. 2181&amp;nbsp;– c. 2055 BCE), [[Ankhtifi]], nomarch of [[Hierakonpolis]], demanded recognition of his suzerainty from the &quot;overseer of Upper Egypt&quot; at Thinis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin1&quot;&gt;Hamblin 2006: 373&lt;/ref&gt; and although the [[Defensive walls|city walls]], cited in Ankhtifi's autobiography,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin1&quot;/&gt; seem to have left Ankhtifi capable of only a [[show of force]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin1&quot;/&gt; he appears to have purchased Thinis' neutrality with [[Cereal|grain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brovarski&quot;&gt;Brovarski 1999: 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ankhtifi's death, Thinis was the northernmost ''nome'' to fall under the sway of [[Intef II]], pharaoh of the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XI]] (c. 2118&amp;nbsp;– c. 2069 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brovarski&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin2&quot;&gt;Hamblin 2006: 375&lt;/ref&gt; Progress north by the Theban armies was halted  by [[Kheti III]], pharaoh of the [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolitan]] [[Ninth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty IX]], in a battle at Thinis itself&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin2&quot;/&gt; that is recorded in the ''[[Teaching for King Merykara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson 1999: 225&lt;/ref&gt; and, throughout Intef II's later years, his war against the Heracleopolitans and their allies, the nomarchs of [[Assyut]], was waged in the land between Thinis and Assyut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin2&quot;/&gt;

As Thebes began to take the upper hand, [[Mentuhotep II]] (c. 2061&amp;nbsp;– c. 2010 BCE), on his campaign of reunification, brought Thinis, which had been in revolt, possibly at Heracleopolitan instigation&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin3&quot;/&gt; and certainly with the support of an army under the command of the nomarch of Assyut,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brovarski&quot;/&gt; firmly under his control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblin3&quot;&gt;Hamblin 2006: 385&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Intermediate Period]] (c. eighteenth century BCE), Thinis may have experienced resurgent autonomy: [[Kim Ryholt|Ryholt]] (1997) proposes that the Abydos dynasty of kings might better be called the &quot;Thinite Dynasty&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt 1997: 163&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in any event, their royal seat was likely at Thinis, already a ''nome'' capital.&lt;ref&gt;Ryholt 1997: 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom and Late Period===
The city's steady decline appears to have halted briefly during [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XVIII]] (c. 1550&amp;nbsp;– c. 1292 BCE), when Thinis enjoyed renewed prominence, based on its geographical connection to various [[Oasis|oases]]&lt;ref&gt;Redford 2003: 176 n. 58&lt;/ref&gt; of possible military importance.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan 2006: 104&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the office of mayor of Thinis was occupied by several notable [[New Kingdom]] figures: Satepihu, who participated in the construction of an [[obelisk]] for [[Hatshepsut]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;/&gt; and was himself subject of an exemplary [[Block statue (Egyptian)|block statue]];&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson 1992: 30&lt;/ref&gt; the [[herald]] Intef, an indispensable member of the royal household and the travelling-companion of [[Thutmose III]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redford 2003: 176&lt;/ref&gt; and Min, tutor to the prince [[Amenhotep III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryan&quot;&gt;Bryan 2006: 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Thinis had declined to a settlement of little significance by the historic period.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1903: 331&lt;/ref&gt; The misleading reference on a seventh-century BCE [[Assyria]]n stele to &quot;Nespamedu, king of Thinis&quot; is nothing more than a reflection of Assyrian &quot;ignorance of the subtlety of the Egyptian political hierarchy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leahy 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, by the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]], Thinis had been supplanted as capital of its ''nome'' by [[Ptolemais Hermiou|Ptolemais]], perhaps even as early as that city's foundation by [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacoma&quot;/&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:The judgement of the dead in the presence of Osiris.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A tableau from the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' (''green-skinned [[Osiris]] is seated to the right''). In ancient Egyptian [[religious cosmology]], Thinis features as a mythical place in [[heaven]].]]
As each ''nome'' was home to the tomb and [[mummy]] of its dead ''nome''-god, so at Thinis was the temple and last resting-place of [[Anhur]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero5&quot;/&gt; whose epithets included &quot;bull of Thinis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2002: 177&lt;/ref&gt; worshipped after his death&lt;ref name=&quot;Maspero5&quot;&gt;Maspero 1903: 163&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Khenti-Amentiu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;/&gt; and who, as ''nome''-god, was placed at the head of the local [[ennead]].&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1903: 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The high priest of the temple of Anhur at Thinis was called the first prophet,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1903: 177&lt;/ref&gt; or chief of seers,&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen 2003: 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frood 2007: 108&lt;/ref&gt; a title that Maspero (1903) suggests is a reflection of Thinis' decline in status as a city.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1903: 177 n.1&lt;/ref&gt;

One such chief of seers, Anhurmose, who died in the reign of [[Merneptah]] (c. 1213&amp;nbsp;– c. 1203 BCE), broke with the tradition of his New Kingdom predecessors, who were buried at Abydos, and was laid to rest at Thinis itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frood&quot;&gt;Frood 2007: 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The lion-goddess [[Mehit]] was also worshipped at Thinis,&lt;ref&gt;Pinch 2002: 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frood 2007: 267&lt;/ref&gt; and the restoration of her temple there during Merneptah's reign was probably overseen by Anhurmose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frood&quot;/&gt;

There is evidence that [[Order of succession|succession]] to the office of chief of seers of Anhur at Thinis was familial: in the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Herakleopolitan period]], one Hagi succeeded his elder brother, also called Hagi, and their father to the post;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the New Kingdom, [[Parennefer called Wennefer|Wenennefer]]&lt;ref&gt;Frood 2007: 97&lt;/ref&gt; was succeeded in the priestly office by his son, Hori.&lt;ref&gt;Frood 2007: 189&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Egyptian [[religious cosmology]], Thinis played a role as a mythical place in [[heaven]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;/&gt; In particular, as set out in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', its [[Eschatology|eschatological]] significance can be seen in certain rituals: when the god [[Osiris]] triumphs, &quot;joy goeth its round in Thinis&quot;, a reference to the celestial Thinis, rather than the earthly city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aswan, Egypt WestBankTombs 2007jan15. 12 byDanielCsorfoly.JPG|thumb|Tomb of [[Sarenput II]].]]
'''Qubbet el-Hawa''' is a site of a big dune on the western bank of the [[Nile]], opposite [[Aswan]].

[[File:Flickr - schmuela - IMG 6421.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Qubbet el-Hawa Tomb.]]

==Ancient Egyptian site - so called Tombs of Nobles==
The elite Tombs date mainly from the [[Old Kingdom]] which provide an insight into the burial traditions of Upper Egyptian Nome 1 during the later Old Kingdom. The tombs include the famous tomb of [[Harkhuf]]. Others belong to [[Sabni]], [[Ishemai]] or [[Heqaib]]. There are later tombs, from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and [[New Kingdom]]. Excavation work continues.

==Coptic site==
The hill is also the site of a Coptic monastery and some of the tombs were reused  as a [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] church.

'''Bigeh''' ({{lang-ar|بجح}}; Ancient Egyptian ''Senem'',&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Karl Brugsch, ''Reiseberichte aus Aegypten'', Olms 1855, p.268&lt;/ref&gt;) is an island and archaeological site situated along the [[Nile|Nile River]] in historic [[Nubia]], and within the [[Aswan Governorate]] of southern [[Egypt]].  The island has been situated in the reservoir of the [[Old Aswan Dam]], since the dam's initial completion in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Peel]],[https://archive.org/details/bindingofnilene00peel The Binding of the Nile and the New Soudan], p.76 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canay Ozden, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00033790.2013.808378#.UgMgFW3pwTk The Pontifex Minimus: William Willcocks and Engineering British Colonialism], p. 196, [[Annals of Science]], 2013.

==Ancient Egypt==
It was formerly an island in the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the [[Nile River]], and its fortification controlled the access to ancient [[Upper Egypt]] and Nubia.  It is a [[World Heritage Site]], located close to [[Philae]] and [[Agilkia Island]]s and their ancient [[archaeological site]]s in the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;''Yale University Publications in Anthropology'', Yale University 1936, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigeh island was sacred to the [[ancient Egypt]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073619/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/Philaebigeh.html The Island of Bigeh], www.philae.nu, date unknown, (accessed 17 February 2014 from archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; There was a belief that [[Osiris]] was buried on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Burton, ''Diodorus Siculus'', Brill 1972, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Thoth]] bore the epithets of &quot;Great and Splendid God in Bigeh&quot; and &quot;He that Pacifies the ''Nsr.t'' in Bigeh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Boylan, ''Thoth Or the Hermes of Egypt'', 1922, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that there may have been a Temple of Thoth on the island.

There are [[archaeological site]]s on the island.

==Geography==
[[File:View 071, Verdant Euphantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt, 1908.jpg|thumbnail|left|Verdant Euphantine Island, opposite Assuan, Egypt.&quot;, 1908. Lantern slide. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Island of Elephantine (Egypt) - Edwin Howland Blashfield - overall.jpg|thumb|left|Island of Elephantine (Egypt) - Edwin Howland Blashfield. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Elephantine island is {{convert|1200|m|ft}} from north to south, and is {{convert|400|m|ft}} across at its widest point.  The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]], at the southern border of [[Upper Egypt]] with [[Lower Nubia]]. This region above is referred to as Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile.

The island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar to that of an [[elephant]] [[elephant tusk|tusk]], or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling elephants. This is the meaning of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word '''''elephas''''' (ελέφας).

==Ancient Egypt==
Known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as ''3bw'' (Middle Eg. /ɫibu:/ &gt; Late Eg. /ʔibu:/ &quot;elephant&quot;), the island of Elephantine stood at the border between Egypt and Nubia. It was an excellent defensive site for a city and its location made it a natural cargo transfer point for river trade. This border is near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the most northerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead at noon and from which it appears to reverse direction or &quot;turn back&quot; at the [[solstices]]. 

Elephantine was a fort that stood just before the first cataract of the Nile.  During the Second Intermediate Period (1650 - 1550 BCE), the fort marked the southern border of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw, Ed, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, New York, 2000, page 206&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Egyptian mythology]], here was the dwelling place of [[Khnum]], the ram-headed god of the cataracts, who guarded and controlled the waters of the Nile from caves beneath the island. He was worshipped here as part of a late [[Triple deities|triad]] among the [[Egyptian pantheon]] of deities. The ''Elephantine Triad'' included Satis and Anuket. [[Satet|Satis]] was worshipped from very early times as a [[war goddess]] and protector of this strategic region of Egypt. When seen as a [[fertility goddess]], she personified the bountiful annual flooding of the Nile, which was identified as her daughter, [[Anuket]].  The cult of Satis originated in the ancient city of [[Swenet]]. Later, when the triad was formed, Khnum became identified as her consort and, thereby, was thought of as the father of Anuket. His role in myths changed later and another deity was assigned his duties with the river. At that time his role as a potter enabled him to be assigned a duty in the creation of human bodies.

[[File:KhnoumTempleElephantine.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Temple of [[Khnum]].]]

===Archaeological sites===
Ongoing excavations by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at the town have uncovered many findings, on display in the Aswan Museum located on the island, including a [[mummy|mummified]] ram of Khnum. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] dating back to [[predynastic]] times have been found on Elephantine. A rare [[calendar]], known as the ''Elephantine Calendar of Things'', which dates to the reign of [[Thutmose III]] during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], was found in fragments on the island.

In ancient times, the island was also an important [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|stone quarry]] providing [[granite]] materials that would be transported widely within Egypt for monuments and buildings.

====Temples====
Prior to 1822, there were temples to [[Thutmose III]] and [[Amenhotep III]] on the island. At that time they were destroyed during the campaign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who had taken power in Egypt, to [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty#Invasion of Libya and Sudan|Conquer Sudan]]. Both temples were relatively intact prior to the deliberate demolition.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The first temple was the [[Temple of Satet]], it was founded around 3000 BC and enlarged and renovated over the next 3000 years. There are records of an [[Egyptian temple]] to [[Khnum]] on the island as early as the [[third Dynasty of Egypt]]. This temple was completely rebuilt in the Late Period, during the [[thirtieth dynasty of Egypt]], just before the foreign rule that followed in the Graeco-Roman Period. The Greeks formed the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] during their three-hundred-year rule over Egypt (305 to 30 BC) and maintained the ancient religious customs and traditions, while often associating the Egyptian deities with their own.

Most of the present day southern tip of the island is taken up by the ruins of the Temple of Khnum. These, the oldest ruins still standing on the island, are composed of a granite [[step pyramid]] from the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|third dynasty]] and a small temple built for the local [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth-dynasty]] [[nomarch]], [[Heqaib]]. In the Middle Kingdom, many officials, such as the local governors [[Sarenput I]] or [[Heqaib III]], dedicated statues and shrines into the temple. There were forty-two such ''nomarch'' provinces created as regional governments that dated from the [[Old Kingdom]] through the Roman Period.

[[File:IlhaElefantina.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Aswan Museum, and a [[nilometer]] (lower left).]]

====Nilometers====
A [[Nilometer]] was a structure for measuring the Nile River's clarity and the water level during the annual flood season. There are two Nilometers at Elephantine Island. The more famous is a corridor Nilometer associated with the Temple of [[Satet|Satis]], with a stone staircase that descends the corridor. It is one of the oldest Nilometers in Egypt, last reconstructed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and still in use as late as the nineteenth century CE. Ninety steps that lead down to the river are marked with [[Hindu-Arabic numerals|Hindu-Arabic]], [[Roman numerals|Roman]], and [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] numerals.  Visible at the water's edge are inscriptions carved deeply into the rock during the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]].

The other Nilometer is a rectangular basin located at the island's southern tip, near the Temple of [[Khnum]] and opposite the Old Cataract Hotel. It is probably the older of the two. One of the Nilometers, though it is not certain which, is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Strabo]].

Many sources claim that the fabled &quot;Well of Eratosthenes&quot;, famous in connection with [[Eratosthenes]]' calculation of the Earth's circumference, was located on the island. Strabo mentions a well that was used to observe that [[Syene]] lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], but the reference is to a well at [[Syene]] (Aswan), not at Elephantine. Neither Nilometer at Elephantine is suitable for the purpose, while the well at Syene is apparently lost.

==Jewish presence==
The [[Elephantine papyri]] are caches of legal documents and letters written in [[Aramaic]], which document a Jewish community, perhaps made up of mercenaries, dating to sometime in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=Botta&gt;{{cite book|last=Botta|first=Alejandro|title=The Aramaic and Egyptian Legal Traditions at Elephantine: An Egyptological Approach|year=2009|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|isbn=978-0567045331|pages=15–116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQKll2gTg4kC&amp;pg=PA16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grabbe&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|title=A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period (vol. 2)|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark|isbn=978-0567541192|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQNlslA72SkC&amp;pg=PA193 |authorlink=Lester L. Grabbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained their own temple (also see [[BYT YHWH|House of Yahweh]]), in which [[Land of Onias#Legitimacy of its sacrificial cult|sacrifices were offered]], evincing [[polytheistic]] beliefs{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, which functioned alongside that of [[Khnum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. van Hoonacker]], ''Une Communité Judéo-Araméenne à Éléphantine, en Egypte, aux vi et v siècles avant J.-C,'' London 1915 cited, [[Arnold Toynbee]], ''A Study of History,'' vol.5, (1939) 1964 p125 n.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple may have been built in reaction to [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]'s reinstitution of pagan worship or simply to serve the needs of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Botta/&gt;

==Other features==
The island has the Aswan Museum at the southern end of the island. Ongoing excavations by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] at the island's ancient town site have uncovered many findings that are now on display in the museum, including a [[mummy|mummified]] ram of Khnum. A sizable population of [[Nubian people]] live in three villages in the island's middle section. A large luxury hotel is at the island's northern end.

The Aswan Botanical Garden is adjacent to the west on [[Kitchener's Island]].

The town was formerly part of the modern [[Qena Governorate]], but as of 9/12/2009, has been incorporated into the new [[Luxor Governorate]]. 

== Latopolis ==
This city of Latopolis (πόλις Λάτων) in the [[Thebaid]] region of Upper Egypt should not be confused with the more northerly city of [[Letopolis]] (Λητοῦς Πόλις), ancient Khem, modern Ausim, in the [[Nile Delta]] in Lower Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trismegistos.org/geo/detail.php?tm=1245|title=Trismegistos|website=www.trismegistos.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/niledeltaruins.htm|title=Egypt: Minor Temple and Other Ruins of the Nile Delta, Part I|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60 Margaret Bunson, ''Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt''] (Infobase Publishing 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-43810997-8}}), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Latopolis&quot; is in honor of the [[Nile perch]], ''Lates niloticus'', the largest of the 52 species which inhabit the Nile,&lt;ref&gt;Russegger, ''Reisen'', vol. I. p.300&lt;/ref&gt; which was abundant in these stretches of the river in ancient times, and which appears in sculptures, among the symbols of the goddess [[Neith]], associated by the [[ancient Greeks]] as [[Athena|Pallas-Athene]], surrounded by the oval shield or ring indicative of royalty or divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, M. and C. vol. V. p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Held sacred, the ''Lates niloticus'' was buried in a cemetery west of the town.

The [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of Esna, dedicated to the god [[Khnum]], his consorts [[Menhit]] and [[Nebtu]], their son, [[Heka (god)|Heka]], and also the goddess [[Neith]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard (editor), ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'' (1999), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;, was remarkable for the beauty of its site and the magnificence of its architecture. It was built of red sandstone, and its portico consisted of six rows of four columns each, with lotus-leaf capitals, all of which however differ from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique-Vivant Denon, ''Voyage dans la Basse et lau Haute Égypte'', vol. I. (1818), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another temple of the same period has been identified at Kom Mer, about 12&amp;nbsp;km to the south, but cannot be excavated because a modern village is built over it.

There was a smaller temple, dedicated to the triad of Latopolis, about two miles and a half north of the city, at a village now called el-Dayr. Here, too, is a small Zodiac of the age of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (246-221 BC). This latter building was destroyed in the 19th century, as it stood in the way of a new canal. The temple of Esna was cleared of the soil and rubbish which filled its area when Denon visited it, and served as a cotton warehouse in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Richard Lepsius, ''Nubische Grammatik mit einer Einleitung über die Völker und Sprachen Afrika's. Berlin: Verlag von Wilhelm Hertz'' (1880), p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the jamb of a gateway &amp;ndash; now converted into a door-sill &amp;ndash; of the reign of [[Thutmose II]] ([[Eighteenth Dynasty]]), the remains of Latopolis belong to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] or [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras. [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], the restorer of so many temples in [[Upper Egypt]], was a benefactor to Latopolis, and he is depicted upon the walls of its temple followed by a tame lion, and in the act of striking down the chiefs of his enemies. The name of [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] is found also inscribed upon a doorway. Although the scale of the ruins are impressive, their sculptures and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] attest to the decline of Egyptian art. The west wall features reliefs of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] and [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]]. The pronaos, which alone exists, resembles in style that of [[Apollonopolis Magna]] ([[Edfu]]), and was begun not earlier than the reign of [[Claudius]] (41-54 AD), and completed in that of [[Vespasian]], whose name and titles are carved on the dedicatory inscription over the entrance. On the ceiling of the pronaos is the larger Latopolitan Zodiac. The name of the emperor [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], the last ruler that can be read in hieroglyphics, although partially erased by his brother and murderer [[Caracalla]] (212), is still legible on the walls of Latopolis. Before raising their own edifice, the Romans seem to have destroyed even the basements of the earlier Egyptian temple. The ceremonial way, which probably linked the quay to the temple, has disappeared. The quay bears cartouches of [[Marcus Aurelius]].

The cemetery west of the town, where the ''Lates niloticus'' was buried, also contains human burials dating of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] to the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].

===Ritual significance===
[[File:Egypt.Esna.Temple.02.jpg|right|thumb|Twilight over the temple]]

The Temple of Esna conveys a sense of the importance which the Ancient Egyptians placed upon their places of worship. All Egyptians who entered the confines of an Egyptian temple were required &quot;to comply with the strict rules regarding ritual purity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Gahlin, Egypt: Gods, Myths and Religion, Anness Publishing Litd (Lorenz Books) 2001. p.106&lt;/ref&gt; According to inscriptions carved on the walls of the Temple of Esna, those who entered this temple were expected to fastidiously cut their fingernails and toenails, remove other body hair, wash their hands with [[natron]] (a natural occurring salt), &quot;be dressed in linen (they were forbidden from wearing wool), and not to have had sexual intercourse for several days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gahlin, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Esna ==
[[File:Esclosa-edfu.png|thumb|[[Lock (water transport)|Canal lock]]]]

Two barrage bridges straddle the [[Nile]] at this point: one built by the British in 1906, and the &quot;Electricity Bridge&quot; built in the 1990s. Navigation, particularly, Nile cruisers ferrying tourists from [[Luxor]] to [[Aswan]] 155&amp;nbsp;km further upstream, can be held up for hours while vessels negotiate their way through the lock system.

The two main points of interest in Esna are its lively tourist-oriented market, which fills a couple of streets leading inland from the [[corniche]]. The other is the temple of Esna. The temple, which has only been partially excavated, is about 200 meters from the river and some 9 meters below street level.

Attackers on a patrol killed a policeman and a civilian, and wounded three other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2017/08/04/Two-killed-three-wounded-in-Egypt-attack-near-Luxor-.html|title=Two killed, three wounded in Egypt attack near Luxor|website=english.alarabiya.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former bishopric === 
Under the older name of &quot;Latopolis,&quot; the city is now a Roman Catholic Latin [[titular see]].

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate]] (BWh).

'''Bawit''' ({{lang-ar|باويط}}; [[Coptic language|Coptic:]] ⲡⲁⲩⲏⲧ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trismegistos.org/place/10454|title=Trismegistos|website=www.trismegistos.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site located {{convert|80|km}} north of [[Asyut]], near the village of Dashlout, in Egypt. It covers an area of {{convert|40|ha}}, and houses a cemetery and the ruins of the Hermopolite Monastery of [[Apa Apollo]] founded by [[Saint Apollo]] in the late 4th century. The structures on this site are relatively well preserved, and demonstrate different aspects of a monastic complex of [[Middle Egypt]].

==History==
The Apa Apolla monastery ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ⲧⲟⲡⲟⲥ ⲛⲁⲡⲁ ⲁⲡⲟⲗⲗⲱ) is a Coptic monastery founded c. 385/390 and had about 500 monks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Badawy1978&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Badawy|first=Alexander|title=Coptic art and archaeology: the art of the Christian Egyptians from the late antique to the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsmfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2012|year=1978|publisher=MIT Press|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth and seventh centuries were a period of prosperity for this monastery, which then hosted a community of women, under the patronage of [[St. Rachel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MikhailMoussa2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikhail|first1=Magad S.

==Excavation==
In early 1901, a survey of the site and surrounding areas was made by [[Jean Clédat]], who was based at the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|French Institute of Oriental Archaeology]] in Cairo. Continuing into 1902, Clédat was assisted by [[Émile Gaston Chassinat]] and [[Charles Palanque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibraryGottheil1925&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Public Library|author2=Richard James Horatio Gottheil|title=Ancient Egypt: sources of information in the New York public library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkC2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2012|year=1925|publisher=The New York public library|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clédat found [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]] he called &quot;chapels&quot; that contained [[Coptic art]]. His colleagues discovered two churches, today simply called North and South Church, with stone and wood carvings that were removed to the [[Coptic Museum]] in Cairo and the [[Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. Numerous sculptures and paintings were unearthed during the excavations.&lt;ref name=&quot;GabraVivian2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabra|first1=Gawdat|last2=Vivian|first2=Tim|title=Coptic Monasteries: Egypt's Monastic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=csmfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2012|year=2002|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-424-691-3|pages=116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyrologist [[Jean Maspero]] (1885–1915)  resumed excavations in 1913, discovering a common room with several entrances.  In 1976, then 1984 and 1985, the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] resumed excavations and added to the collections of the Coptic Museum. Since then, excavations have continued under various organizations.

The '''catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa''' (meaning ''&quot;Mound of Shards&quot;'') is a historical archaeological site located in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] and is considered one of the [[Wonders of the World#Lists from other eras|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]].

The [[necropolis]] consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs, statues and archaeological objects of the Pharaonic funeral cult with [[Hellenistic]] and early [[Imperial Roman]] influences. Due to the time period, many of the features of the catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points; some statues are Egyptian in style, yet bear Roman clothes and hair style whilst other features share a similar style. A circular staircase, which was often used to transport deceased bodies down the middle of it, leads down into the tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the age of the [[Antonine]] emperors (2nd century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/mediterranean-coast/alexandria/sights/historic/catacombs-kom-ash-suqqafa|title=Catacombs of Kom ash-Shuqqafa in Alexandria, Egypt|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was then used as a burial chamber from the 2nd century to the 4th century, before being rediscovered in 1900 when a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. To date, three [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] have been found, along with other human and animal remains which were added later. It is believed that the catacombs were only intended for a single family, but it is unclear why the site was expanded in order to house numerous other individuals. 

Another feature of the catacombs is the Hall of Caracalla, which contains the bones of horses which were the tombs created for the horses of the [[Caracalla|emperor Caracalla]] in 215 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;touregypt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/komelshuqafa3.htm | title = The catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, the Mound of Shards, Part III: The Hall of Caracalla (Nebengrab) | author = Zahraa Adel Awed | publisher = Tour Egypt | date = 2006-05-18 | accessdate = 2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The catacombs were named Kom El Shoqafa, meaning Mound of Shards, because the area used to contain a mound of shards of [[terra cotta]] which mostly consisted of jars and objects made of clay. These objects were left by those visiting the tombs, who would bring food and wine for their consumption during the visit. However, they did not wish to carry these containers home from this place of death so they would break them. At the time of the discovery, heaps of these broken plates were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa in Alexandria, Egypt|url=http://www.vantage-travels.com/day-tour/trip-to-alexandria-monuments-from-alexandria-harbor|publisher=Vantage Travel|accessdate=July 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101020622/http://www.vantage-travels.com/day-tour/trip-to-alexandria-monuments-from-alexandria-harbor|archivedate=January 1, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catacombs lie  the western necropolis of Alexandria and consist of three levels cut through solid rock, the third level being now completely underwater. The catacombs have a six-pillared central shaft which opens off the vestibule. On the left is a [[triclinium]], a funeral banquet hall where friends and family gathered on stone couches covered with cushions, both at the time of burial and also on future commemorative visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/mediterranean-coast/alexandria/sights/historic/catacombs-kom-ash-suqqafa|title=Catacombs of Kom ash-Shuqqafa in Alexandria, Egypt|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A stone staircase descends to the second level, an area eerily alive with sculptures. In the lobby of the building two pillars are topped by the [[papyrus]], [[Lotus (genus)|lotus]], and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves of ancient Egypt and two falcons flanking a winged sun decorate the frieze. Figures of a man and a woman are carved into the wall. The man’s body has a stiff [[hieratic]] pose typical of Ancient Egyptian sculpture, with the head carved in the lifelike manner of the classic Hellenes. The woman’s figure is also rigidly posed but bears the Roman hairstyle.

There are three huge stone coffins with non-removable covers along the sides of the chamber. It’s assumed that bodies were inserted in them from behind, using a passageway which runs around the outside of the funeral chamber. There is a hallway with 91&quot; deep walls in the central tomb chamber, with carved recesses, each providing burial space for three mummies.

Visitors can reach the first level through a breach in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] wall, which was made at an unknown date. This leads to the Hall of Caracalla in which the bones of horses and humans were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa Travel and Tour|url=http://traveltourimmigration.blogspot.com/2011/10/catacombs-of-kom-el-shoqafa.html|publisher=Travel and Tour|accessdate=July 19, 2012|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temple]] of Hibis was once surrounded by the city of Hibis ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Hebet'', meaning &quot;the plough&quot;&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;), which nowadays lies under the crops.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; Construction of the temple started during the [[26th Dynasty]], most likely under [[Pharaoh]] [[Psamtik II]],&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; or possibly even earlier, during the [[25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=w236/&gt; Archaeological evidences suggest that an older temple, dating back to the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], was already present in the same place.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; Several decades after Psamtik II, during the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty|27th Dynasty]], the [[Achaemenid]] pharaoh [[Darius I]] took a particularly active part in its building, being credited of the decoration of the walls.&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;&lt;ref name=zc78&gt;{{cite book|last=Zivie-Coche|first=Christiane|chapter=Late Period Temples|title=UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology|editor-first=Willeke|editor-last=Wendrick|year=2008|publisher=UCLA|location=Los Angeles|url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz000s3mkp|pp=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, several other rulers made additions or decorations here, such as [[Hakor]] of the [[Twenty-ninth Dynasty|29th Dynasty]], notably [[Nectanebo I]] and [[Nectanebo II]] of the [[30th Dynasty]], possibly [[Ptolemy IV]] ([[Ptolemaic Dynasty]]), and at least one [[Roman emperor]].&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt;

A first excavation campaign, organized by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York, took place in 1909–11. A more recent one, led by Eugene Cruz-Uribe, began in 1985.&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Temple of hibis.png|thumb|300px|Plan of the Temple of Hibis]]
The temple bears a close resemblance – both architecturally and regarding inscribed texts – to [[Theban Necropolis|Theban temples]] of the New Kingdom and also of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] period,&lt;ref name=cu488/&gt; yet it differs from both because of some peculiarities, such as the rather bold style of the decorations.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt;&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;

A long hallway, lined with [[sphinx]]es, crosses a series of [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and arrives to the proper temple. This was originally surrounded by a lake, now long-gone.&lt;ref name=w236/&gt; The [[hypostyle hall]] has its walls shaped like huge papyrus rolls, bearing various decorations and several hynms dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] Amun, many of which are known since earlier times.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt; Among the decorations, notable is a depiction of [[Seth (god)|Seth]] defeating [[Apep]], a theme believed by some art historian to be a foreshadowing of [[Saint George and the Dragon]].&lt;ref name=w236/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The walls and the roof are dedicated to the Theban theology and to [[Osiris]] respectively, while the ''[[cella|naos]]'' is subdivided in nine [[Register (art)|registers]], fully decorated with a ''[[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]'' of Egyptian deity and royal figures, for a total of almost 700 figures. At the beginning of each register, the king is depicted while performing a ritual; the Egyptian ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomoi]]'' are also present, each one represented in an Osirian form. In stark contrast with the richness of these representations, the accompanying inscriptions are brief, when not absent at all.&lt;ref name=zc78/&gt;

The relatively good preservation of the Temple of Hibis may be attributed to its seclusion. However, since several decades the building is endangered by a rise of ground water which is damaging its foundations, and the [[Egyptian Antiquities Service]] was taking into consideration a complete dismantling and relocation of the whole temple.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, pp. 236–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabal El Haridi''' is an archaeological site in [[Egypt]] approximately 350 kilometers south of [[Cairo]] within [[Sakulta]], in [[Sohag Governorate]] in Upper Egypt.  The site is located south of Qaw El Kebir ([[Tjebu]]), in an area between the towns of [[El Nawawra]] and [[El Gelawiya]]. The site is very important historically because of the [[Copts|Coptic]] presence throughout the site. This is because this was the beginning of the use of isolated monasteries that brought the hermits together in a settled community. Significant unknown writings from the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] period were found and recorded. The extensive [[quarry]]ing throughout time suggests that Gabal El Haridi contained one of the more important sources of stone under the Ptolemies and [[Ramses III]].  The looting and destruction of the site has caused the site archaeologists great difficulty in determining specific details such as dates and owners of tombs. The details that have been obtained have allowed for a greater understanding of the changes in use of the site throughout its occupation for three thousand years.

==Region==
Gabal El Haridi is approximately 350 kilometers south of Cairo within Sagula, in Sohag province in Upper Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;/&gt; This region is mountainous with large vertical limestone cliffs. The stratum also consists of clay, flint and pebbles in the Ma’aza limestone plateau. The main feature of the site is a vast, curved limestone promontory near the east bank of the Nile River.  As the site continues south, the cliff moves closer to the Nile River. North of the site is a large desert entitled the Plain of Nauwarra. Near the bottom of the gebel, the modern cutting of the El Isawiya Canal bisects the region. Gabal El Haridi’s largest village, El Khazindariya lies south of the ‘Mountain of Ramessess’. An additional village, Nazlet El Haridi was discovered furthers south of the previously mentioned village. A wadi near Nazlet El Haridi contains the tomb of the Sheikh el-Haridi and his son Hassan from the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt;

==Survey and history==
The preliminary surveys of '''Gabal El Haridi''' revealed significant archaeological material from the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] to the late [[Roman Empire]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Routledge, Nov 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coptic period]]. The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, [[rock-cut tomb]]s used as [[necropolis]], and an enclosed [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] settlement were all found within the boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;/&gt;

The earliest mention of the site is by [[Richard Pococke]] in 1763.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;/&gt; The Napoleontic expedition (1798) mentions the site, and [[Robert Hay (Egyptologist)|Robert Hay]] conducted important epigraphic work 1832-3. [[John Gardiner Wilkinson]] followed in 1855, and recorded the old kingdom tombs. [[Nestor L'Hôte]] and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the 19th century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, [[Christian]] brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Masry&quot;&gt;El-Masry, Yahia. Recent Excavations at El Khazindariya in the 9th Nome of Upper Egypt. In The Horizon Studies in Egyptology. (pp.179 - 195)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Spiegelberg]] traveled to the site in 1913 and recorded inscriptions in the Ptolemaic quarry mentioning [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]]. In Porter and Moss the king is referred to as Ptolemy Neos Dionysos. The King appears before [[Min (god)|Min]], Harsiese, [[Isis]], a form of [[Horus]] (called Ka'zana) and the lion-headed [[Repyt]] (Tryphis).&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind. Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings, V Upper Egypt: Sites (Volume 5). Griffith Institute. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labib Habachi]] recorded a large inscription of [[Ramesses III]] which was found at Gabal El Haridi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bard&quot;/&gt;

==EES Excavations and Results==

===First survey (1991–92)===
The first systematic excavation survey began on the 14th of December 1991 and concluded on the 4th of January 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot;&gt;Kirby, Christopher. (1992). Preliminary Report of the First Season of Work at Gabal El Haridi, 1991–92. The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. 78 19–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egypt Exploration Society]] supported the British mission that conducted the three surveys.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Masry&quot; /&gt;
The first survey conducted focused on the quarries at El Khazindariya, the Ptolemaic Quarries, the tombs of the Sheikh El Haridi, and the mud-brick area near the slope of Abu El Nasr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt; Three large quarries were located at El Khazindariya. The significance of these quarries comes from the large rock inscription of [[Ramesses III]] and surface pottery. A rock inscription of Ramesses III, who was the second pharaoh during the twentieth dynasty, implies that quarrying was carried out under his rule in this particular site. The shapes of these quarries were irregularly fan shaped, including many faceted niches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt; The Ptolemaic Quarries are located at the top of Abu El Nasr. These quarries were dated to the Ptolemaic period from royal inscriptions found inside. The major significance of these quarries is the large representation of [[Ptah]] and [[Thoth]] on each side of the north entrance walls facing outwards. The Ptah figure has great importance because of the bulbous crown that was reminiscent of the white crown. In another quarry nearby an inscription of the goddess [[Hathor]] was recorded wearing the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The difference in the crowns worn by the deities indicates the varying time period occupations in the site. Hieroglyphic text was present above Horus and Hathor; unfortunately, it was mutilated, along with the cartouches that were completely destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt; The destruction of the hieroglyphs and the cartouches has caused the modern world to lose the knowledge of who was interned in the nearby tombs, and additional information about the events during that time period in Ancient Egypt history.

Tombs found at the site revealed that the site was being used during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Tomb 1 contains text stating that the owner held a temple official position. The style of the relief figure of a nobleman and the accompanied text allowed the archaeologists to date the tomb to the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt; Tomb 2 may have been re-used for occupation or reburial. This has been postulated because of the mud plaster on several of the quarried walls. The most unusual feature of Tomb 2 is the stars and yellow figure that were used to decorate the ceilings. The yellow figure in the center of the stars has not been positively identified. One idea is that is depicts a fish; if this is true, then it suggests that the ceiling might be astronomical. The date of this tomb is unknown, it could be from the Old, [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle]] or [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]; but because of its proximity to Tomb 1, an Old Kingdom date is favored. The third tomb contains a fragmentary representation of a human figure, painted directly onto the rock face. Tomb 4 and 5 both contain burial debris including human bone and textiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt;

===Second survey (1993)===
The second took place from the 6 to the 13 June 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot;&gt;Kirby, Christopher. (1994). Preliminary Report of the Second Survey Season at Gabal El Haridi, 1993. The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. 80 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second season at Gabal El Haridi focused more specifically on the mud-brick ruins first surveyed in 1991. The primary goal of the archaeologists was to record all of the extant walls and other features that could be measured using EES’s electronic distance metering theodolite. The archaeologists also created a complete a full contour survey of the mud-brick area for [[Topography|topographical]] context with the intent of revealing the mud-brick structures identity and purpose. They hoped that this plan would allow for a general idea of the architecture of the site. Another goal of this survey was to produce a broad, dateable typology of pottery wares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt;

The mud-brick area near the base of the slope of Abu El Nasr is composed of ruined mud-brick walls and occupational debris. This site was found to consist of two distinct areas of ancient debris. The first was at the northern edge of Abu El Nasr and contained shallow mounds that were discolored by decaying mud-brick. The second area was greatly affected by [[erosion]] and [[weathering]]. The remains of this section included building remains, many of which were scattered down the hillside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt; A long wall was found to run southeast to northwest up the side of the mountain in the site for approximately fifty meters. Smaller complexes such as secondary walls surrounded this wall; these secondary walls ran down to the [[canal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1992&quot; /&gt; An interesting characteristic in this area was the large rock-cut rooms with mud-brick structures constructed in front of them. One of these rooms was found to have a remarkable doorway with triangular stone projections mirrored on each side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt; The rock-cut rooms interconnected to room further in the walls. Each of these rooms was cut at differing levels in a semi-circular pattern. The chambers purpose is believed to be funerary; each chamber was a sufficient dimension to house a human body. The internal buildings architectural building techniques were revealed with the study of the natural topography. The inhabitants of the region during the time utilized and exploited the existing rock topography to create their elaborate structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt;

Just to the north of the rock-cut structures were large amounts of [[pottery]] [[sherds]]. The amount of these sherds indicates that the side had intensive occupation focused in the north-easternmost area of the site, with the possibility of it occurring over a long period of time. The analysis of the pottery suggests that the occupation occurred through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and Coptic periods. It was not possible to determine the place of pottery manufacturing, because no clear evidence of a [[kiln]] was discovered. Melted [[clay]] was found on the north side of the site, which may indicate an industrial area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt; During the pottery survey, a fragment of a molded pottery [[Oil lamp|lamp]] was recovered near the rock-cut tombs. The design elements of the lamp indicated to the archaeologists that it was from the third to fourth centuries, but has been more recently suggested that it is from the second century. These lamps are representative of the earliest objects that have been uncovered on the surface of these mud-brick structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt; According to Christopher Kirby the impression left to the archaeologists was that the site was a [[Home|domestic]] [[Human settlement|settlement]] with insular character. This was suggested because of the [[cemetery]] that was found within the [[enclosure]] wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt;

When the analysis of the pottery and the architecture and scale of the walls were combined, the archaeologists at the site suggested that some of the structure remains might be one of an office building or a possible fortified Coptic [[monastery]]. Evidence from the first season of work showed Coptic [[hermit]] use of the ancient quarries for occupation. Another structural component the supports the idea of a monastery is the un-walled settlement that was found north of the site. The pattern of un-walled and walled complexes also occurs at the [[Monastery of Saint Epiphanius]] in Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. The reason for the Coptic monks and hermits location choice is not known, but an idea is that they travelled and inhabited this region because of the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] life the sought. When the [[Coptic Church]] was reformed under [[Pachomius the Great]], the hermits throughout the regions were brought together into organized communities. These communities typically occurred within walled enclosures, giving the possibility that Gabal El Haridi was one of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1994&quot; /&gt;

===Third survey (1998)===
The third and final survey occurred from the 19 July to the 16 August 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1998&quot;&gt;Wilson, Penelope., Gallorini, Carla., Jeffreys, David., &amp; Johnson, W. Raymond. (1999). Fieldwork, 1998-9: Sais, Memphis, Gabal El Haridi, Tel El Amarna, Tel El Amarna Glass Project. The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. 85 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;
The third and final season at Gabal El Haridi purpose was to analyze the necropolis, the record the mud-brick structures outside the Ptolemaic Quarry E and to survey the northern side of the headland. The first section of the site the archaeological team focused on was the preservation of the painted Tomb 2. The conservation effort revealed that the painting has order and symmetry that was not visible previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1998&quot; /&gt; The necropolis showed sign of being illicitly dug because of the scattered contents on the slopes in front of the tomb. Tomb 30 was especially interesting because of its re-use patterns during the Coptic Period. The re-use is consistent with it being used as a Catholic church because of the Latin character that ran around the rim of the chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1998&quot; /&gt; Treasure hunters had vandalized the other tombs throughout the necropolis. The vandalism combined with the natural deterioration, many important pieces of information was lost, such as the owner’s of the tombs. The other significant tomb was Tomb 207. An inscribed image of the tomb owner was found on each side of the entrance. The figures clumsy proportions and the angular frame suggest that this tomb was created during the First Intermediate Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 1998&quot; /&gt; Fortunately, enough data was recovered to help with the understanding of when the site was occupied.

Each of the following seasons focused on specific sections of the site that were uncovered previously. Even though the site has been looted, weathered and eroded throughout time, the site archaeologists believed that it was still possible for a broad archaeological survey to produce meaningful data relating the date and nature of Gabal El Haridi.

'''Wadi al-Jarf''' ({{lang-ar|وادي الجرف}}) is the present name for an area on the [[Red Sea]] coast of Egypt, {{convert|119|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Suez]], that is the site of the oldest known artificial [[harbour]] in the world. It is located at the mouth of the Wadi Araba, a major communication corridor between the Nile Valley and the Red Sea, crossing the [[Eastern Desert]]. The site is also right across the [[Gulf of Suez]] from the small Sinai fortress of [[Tell Ras Budran]]. A somewhat similar ancient port is at [[Ain Sukhna]], a little north of Wadi al-Jarf.

The site was first discovered by [[J. G. Wilkinson]] in 1832. It was rediscovered by a French team in the 1950s, who named it '''Rod el-Khawaga''', but archeological work was quickly abandoned when the [[Suez Crisis]] broke out in 1956. A joint French–Egyptian team resumed excavation in 2011.

The harbor at the site dates to the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]], approximately 4,500 years ago. Also discovered at the site were more than 100 anchors, the first Old Kingdom anchors found in their original context, and numerous storage jars. The jars have been linked with those of another site across the Red Sea, indicating trade between the two sites. A large number of [[papyri]] fragments were found at Wadi al-Jarf, providing insight to life during the Fourth Dynasty. The papyri are the oldest ever found in Egypt.

==Discovery==
Ancient structures have been known to exist at Wadi al-Jarf since at least 1832 when [[J. G. Wilkinson]] noted their existence. He discovered a series of galleries cut into the stone which he believed to be Greek [[catacombs]].&lt;ref name=Discovery&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Ancient Port, Hieroglyphic Papyri Found|author=Rossella Lorenzi|work=Discovery News|date=12 April 2013|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-egypt/worlds-oldest-port-and-egyptian-papyrus-uncovered-130412.htm|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, a group of French amateurs in archeology began to explore some parts of the site, which they named Rod el-Khawaga, but were expelled during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Their notes were published in 2008, spurring interest to resume work.&lt;ref name=BritishMuseum&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ayn Sukhna and Wadi el-Jarf: Two newly discovered pharaonic harbours on the Suez Gulf|work=British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan|last=Tallet|first=Pierre|volume=18|year=2012|pages=147–68|ISSN=2049-5021|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Tallet.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic excavation resumed in 2011 by a joint Egyptian–French archeological team led by Pierre Tallet (University Paris IV-La Sorbonne) and Gregory Marouard (The Oriental Institute, Chicago). In April 2013, archaeologists announced the discovery of an ancient harbor and dozens of [[papyrus]] documents at the location. Those are the oldest papyrus ever found in Egypt (ca. 2560-2550 BC, end of the reign of Khufu).&lt;ref name=Huffington /&gt;

==Artifacts==

===Harbor===
The harbor complex consists of a ca. 150&amp;nbsp;m (492&amp;nbsp;ft) long [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] or jetty of stones that is still visible at low tide ({{coord|28.8888|N|32.6815|E|type:landmark_region:EG|display=inline}}), an ''alamat'' or navigational landmark made of heaped stones, a strange {{convert|60|x|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} building of unknown function that is divided into 13 long rooms, and a series of 25 to 30 storage galleries carved into limestone outcrops further inland. The building of unknown function is the largest pharaonic building discovered along the Red Sea coast to date. The storage galleries are between {{convert|16|and|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and are usually {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=Marouard&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marouard |first1=Gregory |last2=Tallet |first2=Pierre |year=2012 |title=Wadi al-Jarf - An early pharaonic harbour on the Red Sea coast |journal=Egyptian Archaeology |volume=40 |issue= |pages=40–43 |publisher= |doi= |url=https://www.academia.edu/1819574/Wadi_al-Jarf_-_An_early_pharaonic_harbour_on_the_Red_Sea_coast_-_Egyptian_Archaeology_40_2012_p._40-43 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the galleries lay several boat and sail fragments, some oars, and numerous pieces of ancient rope.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt;&lt;ref name=BritishMuseum /&gt; Twenty-five stone anchors were found under water, and 99 anchors were found in an apparent storage building.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt; The discovery of anchors in their original context is a first in Old Kingdom archeology.&lt;ref name=Marouard /&gt; Many of the anchors bear hieroglyphs, likely representing the boat's names from which they came.&lt;ref name=Global /&gt;

The port was the starting point for voyages from mainland Egypt to South Sinai mining operations.&lt;ref name=BritishMuseum /&gt; It is speculated that the harbor may have also been used to launch voyages to &quot;the mysterious [[Land of Punt]]&quot;, a known trading partner of Egypt.&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite news|title=Wadi El Jarf Site Reveals Oldest Harbor, Papyri Ever Found In Egypt|date=17 April 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/wadi-el-jarf-oldest--papyri_n_3094944.html|last=Davis|first=Carlo|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harbor dates to the reign of the Pharaoh [[Khufu]] (2589–2566 B.C.), whose name is inscribed on some of the heavy limestone blocks at the site.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt;&lt;ref name=Global&gt;{{cite news|title=Archeologists discover oldest Egyptian harbor ever found|first=Samantha|last=Stainburn|work=Global Post|date=18 April 2013|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/egypt/130418/archeologists-discover-oldest-egyptian-harbor-ever-fo|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means the harbor predates the second-oldest known port structure by more than 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=Huffington /&gt; There is some trace evidence of use during the early part of [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], after which the harbor was likely abandoned.&lt;ref name=Marouard /&gt;

===Storage jars and papyri===
Numerous stone food and water storage jars, textile and wood fragments, and a collection of hundreds of papyri fragments were also found at the site.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marouard /&gt; Many of the jars feature people's or boat's name in red ink, indicating their owners. The jars are characterized by a very particular [[marl]] composition which had previously been identified in Fourth Dynasty contexts at other sites, including across the [[Gulf of Suez]] at [[Tell Ras Budran]].&lt;ref name=Marouard /&gt;

Ten of the papyri are especially very well preserved.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt; The majority of these documents date to the year after the 13th cattle count of Khufu's reign and describe how the central administration sent food and supplies to Egyptian travelers.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt;&lt;ref name=Global /&gt; One document is of special interest: [[the diary of Merer]], an official involved in the building of the [[Great Pyramid of Khufu]]. Using the diary, researchers are able to reconstruct three months of his life, providing new insight into everyday lives of people of the Fourth Dynasty.&lt;ref name=Discovery /&gt;&lt;ref name=Global /&gt;&lt;ref name=MIFAO136 /&gt; The papyri are the oldest ever found in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Huffington /&gt;

===Residences===
{{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the northwest of the harbor three groups of buildings were found. The rectangular construction and organization of rooms into a cell-like pattern indicated the buildings served as dwelling places.&lt;ref name=Marouard /&gt;

'''Behbeit El Hagar''' is an archaeological site in [[Lower Egypt]]. It contains an [[ancient Egyptian temple]] for the goddess [[Isis]]. The site lies along the [[Damietta]] branch of the Nile, north of [[Sebennytos]] and 8 kilometers (5 mi) west of [[Mansoura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 2000&quot;&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2000). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 10, 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is known as the '''Iseion''' and was the first large temple to have been dedicated to Isis. In earlier shrines at the site, she may have been worshipped alongside her mythological husband, [[Osiris]], and son, [[Horus]]. It was begun by the [[pharaoh|kings]] of the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] (380–343 BC) and completed under [[Ptolemy III]] (r. 246–222 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iseion became one of Isis' major [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] centers. It paralleled the deity's most important temple located at [[Philae]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Unusually, the temple was built entirely of granite. It was demolished at some point, possibly in ancient times, by an earthquake or by the removal of its stone to serve as building material. Only scattered blocks remain there today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 2000&quot;/&gt;

The earliest cities in history appear in the [[ancient Near East]]. The area of the ancient Near East covers roughly that of the modern [[Middle East]]; its history begins in the 4th millennium BC and ends, depending on the interpretation of the term, either with the conquest by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC or that by [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC.

The largest '''cities of the [[Bronze Age]] [[Ancient Near East|Near East]]''' housed several tens of thousands. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]] with some 30,000 inhabitants was the largest city of the time by far. [[Ur]] in the [[Middle Bronze Age]] is estimated to have had some 65,000 inhabitants; [[Babylon]] in the [[Late Bronze Age]] similarly had a population of some 50,000–60,000, while [[Niniveh]] had some 20,000–30,000, reaching 100,000 only in the [[Iron Age]] (ca. 700 BC).

'''Wadi Tumilat''' ([[Old Egyptian]] '''Tjeku/Tscheku/Tju/Tschu''') is the {{convert|50|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} dry river valley ([[wadi]]) to the east of the [[Nile delta]]. In prehistoric times, it was a [[distributary]] of the Nile. It starts from the area of modern [[Ismaïlia]] and continues from there to the west.

In ancient times, this was a major communication artery for caravan trade between Egypt and points to the east. The [[Canal of the Pharaohs]] was built there. A little water still flows along the wadi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geocurrents.info/geonotes/egypts-storied-wadi-tumilat Egypt’s Storied Wadi Tumilat] GeoCurrents website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic name 'Wadi Tumilat' is believed to reflect the existence in the area, in ancient times, of an important temple of the god [[Atum]] (Old Egyptian ''pr-itm'', 'House of Atum', changed over time into 'Tumilat', as well as into '[[Pithom]]').&lt;ref&gt;[[James K. Hoffmeier]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SMZnDgFxiTUC&amp;pg=PA64 ''Ancient Israel in Sinai: The Evidence for the Authenticity of the Wilderness Tradition.''] Oxford University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0198035403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadi Tumilat has the ruins of several ancient settlements. The earliest site excavated is that of Kafr Hassan Dawood, which dates from the Predynastic to the Early Dynastic Period.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hassan and G. J. Tassie, [http://www.e-c-h-o.org/khd/index.html ''Kafr Hassan Dawood''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the [[New Kingdom]] period, there was a well fortified site at [[Tell el-Retabah]]. But then, in the [[Saite Dynasty]] period, the major settlement and fort were moved east to [[Tell el-Maskhuta]], only 12&amp;nbsp;km to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/78257745/104/Tell-el-Maskhuta-and-Tell-el-Herr ''An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt''.] Blackwell Pub., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Necho II]] (610–595 BC) initiated—but may have never completed—the ambitious project of cutting a navigable [[canal]] from the [[Pelusium|Pelusiac]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the [[Red Sea]]. [[Canal of the Pharaohs|Necho's Canal]] was the earliest precursor of the [[Suez Canal]], and it went through Wadi Tumilat.&lt;ref&gt;Redmount, Carol A. &quot;The Wadi Tumilat and the &quot;Canal of the Pharaohs&quot;&quot; ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 54, No. 2 (April , 1995), pp. 127-135&lt;/ref&gt; It was in connection with a new activity that Necho founded a new city of ''Per-Temu Tjeku'' which translates as 'The House of [[Atum]] of Tjeku' at Tell el-Maskhuta.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ian; and Nicholson, Paul. The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt. The British Museum Press, 1995. p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1820, Mohammad Ali, the Ottoman Governor of Egypt, brought 500 Syrians to the Wadi and equipped them with animals and labor to construct 1,000 [[sakia]]s for the cultivation of mulberry trees for silk production. The irrigation system was repaired by cleaning and deepening of existing canals. Labor was provided by forcing peasants to work.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, M., Kenneth (1980): The Origins of Private Ownership of Land in Egypt: A Reappraisal. Cambridge University Press, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Nov., 1980), pp.245-275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, E.R.J. (1969): Cotton and the Egyptian Economy, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Tell Shaqafiya in the Wadi is also associated with the Canal and its operation.

The site of [[Tell el Gebel]] is mostly of the Roman period.

In 1930, a team from the German Institute in Cairo conducted a survey of Wadi Tumilat. Later on, some [[Hyksos]] tombs were also discovered in the area at [[Tell es-Sahaba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC&amp;pg=PA1078#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt''], edited by Kathryn A.

===Wadi Tumilat Project===
Modern excavations at Tell el-Maskhuta were carried out by the [[University of Toronto]] 'Wadi Tumilat Project' under the direction of John Holladay. They worked over five seasons between 1978 and 1985.

As many as 35 sites of archaeological significance have been identified in the Wadi. The three large tells in the Wadi are Tell el-Maskhuta, Tell er-Retabah, and Tell Shaqafiya.

Tell er-Retabah has been investigated by the archaeologist Hans Goedicke of [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.stlcc.edu/mfuller/Retaba.html/ Hans Goedicke - excavations at Tell er-Retaba] St. Louis Community College&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several biblical references to the area of Wadi Tumilat. For example, the ancient [[Pithom]] is believed to be here.

The western end of the Wadi Tumilat is identified as part of the [[Land of Goshen]].

Wadi Tumilat—an arable strip of land serving as the ancient transit route between Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai—is also seen by scholars as the biblical 'Way of [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EFYp8I3icisC&amp;pg=PA113 ''Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention?'']  Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|0805446796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholar [[Edouard Naville]] identified the area of Wadi Tumilat as [[Sukkot (place)|Sukkot]] (Tjeku), the 8th Lower Egypt [[nome (Egypt)|nome]]. This location is also mentioned in the Bible.

'''Minshat Abu Omar''' (also written '''Minschat Abu Omar'''; Arab. '''Minshāt Abū `Umar''') is an important archaeological site in Northern [[Egypt]]. It lies around 93.21 miles north-east of [[Cairo]] in the [[Nile delta]]. Minshat Abu Omar contains several [[cemetery|cemeteries]] from [[Protodynastic Egypt|protodynastic dynasties]], as well as many burial sites that date back to the late [[Roman Era]].&lt;ref name=KKM/&gt;&lt;ref name=KKR/&gt;&lt;ref name=THW/&gt;

== Archaeological history ==
Organized excavations started in 1966, after some interesting artifacts appeared in several museums and were said to originate from that area. Originally, the area was examined to prove the correctness of the claims. After continuing findings, excavations ran from 1978 to 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;/&gt;

== The cemeteries ==
The cemeteries were excavated mostly at the southern corner of the area. 420 tombs are dating back to the late [[Naqada III]] period up to the beginning of the 1st dynasty. 2630 tombs date back to the late [[Roman period]]. The early tombs, especially, are of great interest to [[Egyptologist]]s, archaeologists and historians, because they come from different dynasties and show important developments in their architecture.&lt;ref name=KKM/&gt;&lt;ref name=KKR/&gt;

The protodynastic tombs were oval, 1.0 - 1.5m long and 1.5 - 2.0m deep. They contained simple pits, in which the deceased was laid down in a fetal pose, his head facing toward the west. Beside and around the deceased, several bowls and vases were placed; in some of the tombs, precious artifacts made of [[ivory]] and stone were found.&lt;ref name=KKM/&gt;&lt;ref name=KKR/&gt;

The early dynastic tombs changed quickly in architecture, now they had mud plastered inner walls and they were rectangular in shape. Their floors were covered and strengthened with reed mats, their ceilings made of reed and - in case of royal tombs - cedar wood. Royal tombs were now divided into two, four or six chambers and contained much more precious grave goods. Famous objects such as several [[cosmetic palette]]s, ivory bracelets with relief decoration and collars made of [[carnelian]]- and [[amethyst]] beads were found. Famous kings, whose name were found, are [[Scorpion II]], [[Narmer]] and [[Hor-Aha|Aha]].&lt;ref name=KKM/&gt;&lt;ref name=KKR/&gt;

The Roman period tombs are simple in their structure and design; they were oval or rectangular and contained coffins made of wood, ceramics and limestone. Children were buried in large amphorae. Some of the tombs contained coins and amulets.&lt;ref name=&quot;KKM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KKR&quot;/&gt;

== Evaluations ==
The excavated cemeteries and nearby settlements, their [[grave goods]] and the geographical position of that area (at the easternmost border of early dynastic Egypt), lead archaeologists and Eyptologists to the conclusion that Minshat Abu Omar was an important economic and strategic place. Findings, which were of early [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] origin, but found in several larger tombs at Minshat Abu Omar, prove that during the Naqada III period numerous items were already traded between Egypt and the [[levant]]ine states; the trade economy flourished greatly. Artifacts and weapons with the names of Narmer, Aha and Djet were found in [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and even in [[Lebanon]], which proves successful trading during the first dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;THW&quot;/&gt;

'''Hermopolis'''&lt;ref&gt;([[Ammianus Marcellinus]], II 16)&lt;/ref&gt; (also ''Hermopolis Magna'', {{lang-grc|Ἑρμοῦ πόλις μεγάλη}} ''Hermou polis megale'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]] ''s.v.''; [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] IV 5. § 60.
[[Antonine Itinerary|It. Anton.]] pp 154, seq.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-egy|Khemenu, Ḫmnw}}, {{lang-cop|ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛⲏ}}&lt;ref&gt;https://st-takla.org/books/pauline-todary/coptic-language/egyptian.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was a major city in antiquity, located  near the boundary between [[Lower Egypt|Lower]] and  [[Upper Egypt]]. 
[[File:Nectanebo II obelisk.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Black [[siltstone]] [[obelisk]] of King [[Nectanebo II]]. According to the vertical inscriptions he set up this obelisk at the doorway of the [[sanctuary]] of [[Thoth]], the Thrice-Great, Lord of Hermopolis. It is now on display in the [[British Museum]], [[London]].]]
A provincial capital since the [[Old Kingdom]] period, Hermopolis developed into a major city of [[Roman Egypt]], and an early [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christian]] center from the 3rd century.  It was abandoned after the [[Muslim invasion of Egypt|Muslim invasion]] but was restored as both a Latin Catholic (meanwhile suppressed) - and a Coptic Orthodox [[titular see]].

Its remains are located near the modern [[Egypt]]ian town of '''El Ashmunein''' ({{lang-ar|الأشمونين}}, from [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: '''{{Coptic|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛⲉⲓⲛ}}''' ''Shmounein'') near the city [[Mallawi]], in [[Al Minya governorate]].

== Etymology ==
''Khemenu'' (''{{lang|egy|Ḫmnw}}''), the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian name of the city,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw &amp; Paul Nicholson, ''The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, British Museum Press'', 1995. p.125&lt;/ref&gt; means &quot;eight-town&quot;, after the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], a group of eight deities who represented the world before creation. The name survived into [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as '''{{Coptic|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛⲉⲓⲛ}}''' (Shmounein), from which the modern name, El Ashmunein, is derived.
In [[Greek language|Greek]], the city was called Hermopolis, after [[Hermes]], whom the Greeks identified with [[Thoth]], because the city was the main cult centre of Thoth, the Pharaonic god of magic, healing and wisdom, and the patron of scribes. [[Thoth]] was associated in the same way with the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Eshmun]]. Inscriptions at the temple call the god &quot;The Lord of Eshmun&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.22:1:182.geography] {{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tomb of Djehutynakht 21.jpg|thumb|200px|Objects from the tomb of [[Djehutynakht (10A)|Djehutynakht]], a [[nomarch]] during the Middle Kingdom era of Egypt.]]
The city was the capital of the [[Hare nome]] (the fifteenth [[nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]]) in the [[Heptanomis]]. Hermopolis stood on the borders of Upper and [[Lower Egypt]], and, for many ages, the [[Thebaïd]] or upper country extended much further to the north than in more recent periods. As the border town, Hermopolis was a place of great resort and opulence, ranking second to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] alone. A little to south of the city was the castle of Hermopolis, at which point the river craft from the upper country paid toll ({{lang|grc|Ἑρμοπολιτάνη φυλακή}}, [[Strabo]] xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;813; Ptol. ''loc. cit.''; the [[Bahr Yussef]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). The grottos of [[Beni Hasan]], near [[Antinopolis]], upon the opposite bank of the Nile, were the common cemetery of the Hermopolitans, for, although the river divided the city from its necropolis, yet, from the wide curve of the western hills at this point, it was easier to ferry the dead over the water than to transport them by land to the hills.

Hermopolis became a significant city in the [[Roman province]] of [[Thebais Prima]] in the administrative [[diocese of Egypt]].

The principal pagan deities worshipped at Hermopolis were [[Typhon|Typhôn]] and [[Thoth]]. 
Typhon was represented by a [[hippopotamus]], on which sat a hawk fighting with a serpent. ([[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Is. et Osir'', p.&amp;nbsp;371, D.) Thoth, whom the [[Ancient Greeks]] associated with [[Hermes]] because they were both gods of magic and writing, was represented by the [[Ibis]].

== Ecclesiastical history ==
{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2017}}
{{Overly detailed|section|date=July 2017}}
A Christian tradition holds it to be the place where the [[Holy Family]] found refuge during its exile in Egypt.

Hermopolis Maior was a [[suffragan diocese]] of the provincial capital's Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Antinoe]], in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]]. Like most, it faded under Islam.

=== Residential bishops ===
The flowing incumbents were recorded:
* Conon (circa 250)
* Fasileus (in 325)
* Dios (circa 350)
* Plusianus (4th century)
* Andreas (in 431)
* Gennadius (circa 444 - after 449)
* Victor (circa 448/463)
* Ulpianus (6th century)
* Johannes I (6th century)
* Johannes II (6th-7th century)
* Isidorus (7th century)
* Eugenius (?)
* Paulus (?)

=== Catholic titular see ===
The city was a titular diocese in the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|id=07289a|title=Hermopolis Magna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still is (?) in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].

The diocese was nominally restored in the 18th century as Latin [[Titular bishopric]] of '''Hermopolis Maior''' (Latin; 1925-1929 renamed Hermopolis Magna) / '''Ermopoli Maggiore''' (Curiate Italian)

Its territory was reassigned in 1849 to the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Mina]], as a restoration of Hermopolis (as its Latin title attests).

In 1949 the titular see was suppressed, having had the following incumbents, all of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :
* Luigi Antonio Valdina Cremona (1729.03.23 – death 1758.10.24) (Italian) no actual prelature recorded 
* Dominik Józef Kiełczewski (1760.07.21 – death 1776.02.28) as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chełm]] (Poland) (1760.07.21 – retired 1775.07.14) and on emeritate
* [[Bishop-elect]]? Bernardo Maria Serio (1802.08.09 – death ?) as Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Archdiocese of Palermo]] (Sicily, Italy) (1802.08.09 – ?)
* Denis-Antoine-Luc de Frayssinous (French) (1822.04.19 – death 1841.12.12) no actual prelature recorded

== Remains ==
Hermopolis comparatively escaped the frequent wars which, in the decline both of the Pharaonic and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras, devastated the Heptanomis; but, on the other hand, its structures have undergone severe changes under its [[Muslim]] rulers, who have burned its stones for lime or carried them away for building materials. A surviving [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] of the 3rd century AD indicates that high-rise buildings with seven stories existed in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2719, in: Katja Lembke &amp; Cäcilia Fluck, Günter Vittmann, ''Ägyptens späte Blüte. Die Römer am Nil'', Mainz 2004, {{ISBN|3-8053-3276-9}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Arabic papyri in the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester, contains many documents referring to Hermopolis (''Ushmun''); they date from the 2nd to 4th centuries AH.&lt;ref&gt;Margoliouth, D. S. (1933) ''Catalogue of Arabic Papyri in the John Rylands Library, Manchester''. Manchester: the John Rylands Library&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structures ===
The Ibis-headed god Thoth was, with his accompanying emblems, the [[Ibis]] and the Cynocephalus monkey, the most conspicuous among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was &quot;The Lord of Eshmoon&quot;. This portico was a work of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic era]], but the erections of the [[Ptolemies]] at Hermopolis were on a scale of great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the centre of one pillar to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The intercolumnation of the centre pillars is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of [[Gournou]]. (Dénon, ''L'Egypte'', plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted that it is difficult to detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28½ feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the intercolumnation is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart.

=== Museum ===
Currently there is a small open-air museum in which stand two massive statues of [[Thoth]] as a baboon worshipping the sun, and a few carved blocks of masonry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13984">'''Deir el-Ballas''' is an archaeological site in [[Upper Egypt]]. It was the location of a royal [[palace]] and [[Administration (government)|administration]] center occupied by rulers of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]] in [[ancient Egypt]]'s late [[Second Intermediate Period]].

== Location ==

Deir el-Ballas was &quot;strategically located at a bend in the Nile&quot; on its western bank&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, approximately twenty kilometers south of [[Dendara]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arce.org/publications/books/u9|title=Deir el-Ballas Preliminary Report on the Deir el-Ballas Expedition, 1980-1986 {{!}} American Research Center in Egypt|website=www.arce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and just north of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (modern-day [[Luxor]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The complex was &quot;a short-lived royal city-palace built by Theban kings as a military base for imperial campaigns against the [[Hyksos]], a group of foreign rulers who had taken control of northern (Lower) Egypt during a period of national weakness at the end of the Middle Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Which of these kings built it in which dynasty is not yet known.

&quot;A collection of inscribed potsherds, or [[ostraca]], were recovered from Deir el-Ballas. These confirm that the forces for the attack on the [[Hyksos]] capital were marshalled here, and describe the large quantities of goods and personnel that were brought to the site, including cattle, men, possibly weapons, and, most interestingly, a roster of ships and their crews. The [[Kamose]] Stela....mentions the assembly of the Theban fleet at a place called Per-djed-ken, which may well be the original name for Deir el-Ballas; another text mentions a royal residence at Sedjefatawy that belonged to Ahmose, the Theban king credited with driving out the Hyksos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;With the success of the Thebans, the city-palace at Deir el-Ballas was no longer necessary, and was swiftly abandoned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the surrounding area continued to be used for a short time as a burial ground, as cemeteries were discovered &quot;dating to the late Second Intermediate Period and the early 18th Dynasty, during the second half of the 16th centuries BC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==

[[File:Northern Palace of Deir el-Ballas.jpg|thumb|A Rendering of the Northern Palace]]

Deir el-Ballas consisted of several facilities-- the North Palace, the South Palace, and &quot;clusters of habitation...located north and south of the
central [North] palace&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ballas-Report-for-Hussein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The latter included a workman's village,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt; an administrative quarter &quot;and a number of private houses, which ranged in size from small two-room huts to large 'villas'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ballas-Report-for-Hussein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Lacovara provided information on these at length in the September 2017 issue of Current World Archaeology:

&quot;The royal residence--North Palace – was built at the midpoint of a large semicircle of limestone cliffs that border the low desert, with clusters of residential buildings to the north and south of it...The full size of the settlement is unknown, as the eastern end of the site, which extends into agricultural land, remains uncovered. However, at least 45,000m2  of the North Palace and its enclosures have been recorded... The palace itself is made of unusually large mud bricks, about 54cm × 27cm × 18cm, and comprises a series of columned courts and a long entrance hall, grouped around an elevated central platform. This platform was constructed on casemate foundations: long mud-brick chambers filled in with rubble and capped by a brick pavement. Some of these casemates survive to a height of about 5m. They once supported the raised private apartments of the palace, which would have given it the appearance of a fortified 'Migdol’ tower.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Lacovara notes elsewhere that &quot;the palace was decorated with wall paintings of armed men carrying battle axes&lt;ref&gt;P. Lacovara, “Archaeological Survey of Deir el-Ballas,” ARCE Newsletter 113 (1980). pp. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;, and faience tiles, fragments of which were recovered by the Hearst Expedition.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Margaret Bunson, &quot;the palaces (pero or per-a'a) (of the [[Second Intermediate Period]]) always contained two gateways, two main halls, and two administrative sections to reflect the upper and lower regions of the nation. Flagstaffs were used at the gates, as they were placed before temples. The remains of the Seventeenth Dynasty (1640–1550 BCE) palace at Deir el-Ballas, on the western shore north of Thebes, indicate somewhat luxurious surroundings and innovative decoration, following the &quot;double&quot; scheme. In some instances the walls and floors were designed to portray pools of fish and vast tracts of flowering shrubs.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Margaret. &quot;art and architecture in ancient Egypt.&quot; Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2002. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?
ItemID=WE49&amp;iPin=EEGY0223&amp;SingleRecord=True (accessed February 11, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the workmen’s village, it was situated apart from the main settled area. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;A series of roughly built stone and mud-brick structures, consisting of one or more courts connected by short flights of stairs, were cut into the hillside. They closely resemble the layout of chapels found in the workmen’s village at Amarna.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, &quot;the southern extent of the settlement at Deir el-Ballas was marked by a large, rectangular mud-brick platform. Reisner [head of the Hearst expedition in 1900-1901] called this the ‘South Palace’, but it is clearly non-residential in character. Situated at the top of the hill, far from the rest of the settlement, it enjoyed commanding views of the Nile and surrounding countryside. The building has a wide terrace, fronting an elevated platform measuring about 40m wide and 150m long, with a broad flight of stairs leading to the top. Though the upper section of the platform, which has been all but destroyed by centuries of looting, probably supported reed structures or tents rather than a substantial construction. The design and location of the ‘South Palace’ suggest that, rather than a palace, it was an observation tower, keeping watch over the river and the southern approach to the settlement, and monitoring traffic entering the settlement. It was also an ideal post from which to watch the movement of the Theban fleet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Deir-el-Ballas-CWA-084-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excavation ==
[[Image:Block Djehuti Petrie.jpg|thumb|90px|Brick with [[cartouche]]s of pharaoh Djehuti, unearthed at Deir el-Ballas]]
Deir el-Ballas was excavated from 1900 to 1901 by a University of California team, sponsored by Phoebe A. Hearst and led by George Andrew Reisner &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arce.org/publications/books/u9|title=Deir el-Ballas Preliminary Report on the Deir el-Ballas Expedition, 1980-1986 {{!}} American Research Center in Egypt|website=www.arce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;These excavations uncovered a large royal palace, a settlement, and a series of cemeteries dating to the late Second Intermediate Period and the early Eighteenth Dynasty;&quot; however, expedition records neither proved adequate enough for understanding &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arce.org/publications/books/u9|title=Deir el-Ballas Preliminary Report on the Deir el-Ballas Expedition, 1980-1986 {{!}} American Research Center in Egypt|website=www.arce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt; nor were ever compiled for publication. (The Ancient Egyptian Heritage and Archaeology Fund, however, received a grant to accomplish this in the 2010s from the Shelby White and Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/project/deir-el-ballas-publication/&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 all of the items from the Hearst expedition had been documented save for the collection stored at the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, University of California; once this work is completed a draft manuscript will be composed and sent for final editing and publication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/project/deir-el-ballas-publication/&lt;/ref&gt;) 

&quot;In order to clarify the records of the expedition and enable publication of the site, four seasons of survey and clearance were undertaken in l980, 1983, 1984 and 1986 by Peter Lacovara under the sponsorship of the American Research Center and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Boston]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arce.org/publications/books/u9|title=Deir el-Ballas Preliminary Report on the Deir el-Ballas Expedition, 1980-1986 {{!}} American Research Center in Egypt|website=www.arce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings &quot;revealed a site far larger than the Hearst expedition records had indicated, including palace complexes, a group of large houses, and remains of a previously unrecorded ancient settlement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arce.org/publications/books/u9|title=Deir el-Ballas Preliminary Report on the Deir el-Ballas Expedition, 1980-1986 {{!}} American Research Center in Egypt|website=www.arce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In addition to the large number of houses and other domestic structures, there appears to have been a group of memorial chapels similar to those recently excavated by The Egypt Exploration Society at Tell el-Amarna, and possibly an administrative quarter, also corresponding to Tell el-Amarna. At the conclusion of the survey seasons, a preliminary report was published under the auspices of the American Research Center in Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some significant items discovered in this area include a brick inscribed with the name of the [[pharaoh]] [[Djehuti]] from the [[Second Intermediate Period]]&lt;ref&gt;Christina Geisen, Zur zeitlichen Einordnung des Königs Djehuti an das Ende der 13. Dynastie, Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur, Bd. 32, (2004), pp. 149-157&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hearst papyrus]], a [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]-era medical text discovered in the area by an [[Egypt]]ian peasant around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210014002/http://tebtunis.berkeley.edu/collection/medical.html|title=The Hearst Medical Papyrus|date=2003-12-10|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Lacovara, &quot;In more recent years, the growth of the modern village and the construction of a number of roads along the desert edge, along with looting that occurred during the revolution in 2011 has threatened to destroy a significant part of the site.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/deir-el-ballas-full-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

For two weeks in January 2017, Lacovara led an expedition &quot;consist[ing] of a theodolite survey, photography and planning to assess the condition of the site, the perimeter of the antiquities area and possible ways to protect and conserve the site.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/project/deir-el-ballas-fieldwork/&lt;/ref&gt; The team returned January 2018 seeking to repair a wall at the South Palace, fill in casemates at the North Palace, clear the sites of trash, and place signs and fencing around the dig sites to deter further damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientegyptarchaeologyfund.com/project/deir-el-ballas-fieldwork/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sphinx from Nebesheh 3.jpg|thumb|Royal sphinx from Nebesheh; black granite; [[12th Dynasty]]. [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]]]
'''Tell Nebesha''' or '''Nebesheh''' (also known as 'Faraon' or 'Farun') is an archaeological site in Egypt, and the location of the ancient city of '''Imet'''. It is found around 10km south of [[Tanis]] in the Eastern Nile Delta. This was the ancient capital of the 19th [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]]. By the [[Assyria|Assyrian period]], it was succeeded by Tanis.

==Archaeology==
The site consists of three areas: the temple site, the town, and the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltasurvey.ees.ac.uk/farun187.html Farun-Nebesheh site survey] www.deltasurvey.ees.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple at the site, dedicated to the goddess [[Wadjet]], the cobra goddess of Lower Egypt, may have been constructed during the Ramesside Period. Yet the evidence of inscriptions discovered at the site &quot;clearly indicates that occupation begun in the [[18th Dynasty]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;athena.u-pec&quot;&gt;Vincent Razanajao, [http://athena.u-pec.fr/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=upec&amp;docId=aleph_upec_xml000570497&amp;fromSitemap=1&amp;afterPDS=true D'Imet à Tell Farâoun : recherches sur la géographie, les cultes et l'histoire d'une localité de Basse-Égypte orientale.] (English synopsis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadjet was worshipped in the area as the 'Lady of Imet'. Later she was joined by [[Min (god)|Min]] and [[Horus]] to form a triad of deities. This was based on an Osiriac model identified elsewhere in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;athena.u-pec&quot; /&gt;

The enclosure contained two temples. A smaller one has been dated by foundation deposits naming King [[Ahmose II]] (Amasis) of [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]]. It seems to have been dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] Min. The bigger temple was dedicated to Wadjet.

Re-used monuments from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] were also found. They may have been moved here from another location.

==Excavations by Petrie==
In 1886, while working for the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]], [[Flinders Petrie]] first excavated there. Among the remains of an ancient temple, Petrie found a royal [[sphinx]], now located at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. The sculpture is now believed to date to the time of [[Amenemhat III]] ([[12th Dynasty]]) or later.&lt;ref&gt;Rita E. Freed, ''Defending Connoisseurship: A Thrice Re-inscribed Sphinx of Dynasty XII'', in Donald P. Hansen, Erica Ehrenberg, eds. [http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=6lDgYxV0DN8C&amp;pg=PA77 ''Leaving No Stones Unturned: Essays on the Ancient Near East and Egypt in Honor of Donald P. Hansen.''] Eisenbrauns, 2002. p. 77 {{ISBN|1575060558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrie concluded that the temple was built during the 12th Dynasty, and then reused in the [[19th Dynasty]] under [[Ramesses II]].

In the course of Petrie's excavations,

{{quotation|In one of the earlier tombs no fewer than two hundred uninscribed funerary statuettes in green-glazed pottery were found; and in another some thirty thousand beads of glass, silver, and lapis lazuli. Bronze spear-heads, amulets, scarabs, etc., were also turned up in considerable numbers.|Amelia Edwards, [http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/edwards/pharaohs/pharaohs-1.html ''Pharaohs Fellahs and Explorers.''] New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1891.}}

Petrie also found the remains of a colossal seated statue of Rameses II, a Middle Kingdom granite altar, and remains of two Middle Kingdom statue-thrones carved from red sandstone.

More recently, the Egyptian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] excavated there. Middle Kingdom and later burials were identified.
Some [[Saite]] tombs were found in the 1985/6 seasons.

[[Image:Silsileh.jpg|thumb|right|Rock temples cut directly in the rocks at the [[Gebel el-Silsila|Silsileh]] quarrying site, near [[Aswan]]]]
The '''stone quarries of ancient Egypt''' once produced quality stone for the construction of decorative monuments such as [[sculpture]]s and [[obelisk]]s. These quarries are now recognised [[Archaeology|archaeological]] sites. Eighty percent of the ancient quarry sites are in the [[Nile|Nile valley]]; some of them have disappeared under the waters of [[Lake Nasser]] and some others were lost due to modern [[mining]] activity.

Some of the sites are well identified and the chemical composition of their stones is also well known, allowing the geographical origin of most of the monuments to be traced using [[Petrography|petrographic]] techniques, including [[neutron activation analysis]].
 
In June 2006 the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA)]] of [[Egypt]] established a new department for conservation of ancient quarries and mines in Egypt. The new department was designed to work in close cooperation with the regional SCA offices, and special training programmes for ''Inspectors of Antiquities'' will be carried out to enable the regional authorities to tackle inventory, documentation, risk assessment and management of the ancient quarries and mines. 

This article details some of the most important ancient quarry sites in Egypt.

== The quarries of Aswan ==
The quarries of Aswan are located along the [[Nile]] in the city of [[Aswan]]. There are a number of well-known sites: [[Shellal]], consisting of northern and southern quarries within an area of about {{convert|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} on the west bank, and the islands of [[Elephantine]] and [[Seheil]]. One of the known directors of the Aswan sites was Hori during the reign of [[Ramses III]]. In the present days, the quarry area is to become an open-air museum.&lt;ref name=aawo-fog&gt;{{cite web|last=El-Aref|first=Nevine|title=Fish, ostriches and granite|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/656/hr1.htm|work=Al-Ahram Weekly Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gebel el-Silsila]] or Gebel Silsileh is {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Aswan]] along the banks of the [[Nile]]. It was a very well known quarrying area throughout all of ancient Egypt due to the quality of the building stone quarried there.  The site is a rich archaeological area, with temples cut directly in the hills. Examples include the rock temple of [[Horemheb]] on the west bank. Many of the monuments here bear inscriptions of [[Hatshepsut]], [[Amenhotep II]], [[Ramesses II]], [[Merenptah]], and [[Ramesses III]]. The quarries and the stone temples here are visible from boats on the [[Nile]].

'''Myos Hormos''' was a [[Red Sea]] port constructed by the [[Ptolemies]] around the 3rd century BC. Following excavations carried out recently by David Peacock and [[Lucy Blue]] of the University of Southampton, it is thought to have been located on the present-day site of Quseir al-Quadim (old Quseir), eight kilometres north of the modern town of [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Myos Hormos, after the Ptolemies, was with [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice]] (further south on the [[Red Sea]] coast) one of the two main ports in [[Roman Egypt]] for trade with [[India]], [[Africa]] and probably [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nabataea.net/isearoute.html Roman sea routes in the Indian Ocean&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of its main destinations were the [[Indus|Indus delta]], [[Muziris]] and the [[Kathiawar]] peninsula in [[India]]. The coastal trade from Myos Hormos and Berenice along the coast of the [[Indian Ocean]] is described in the anonymous 1st century AD handbook [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]].

According to [[Strabo]] (II.5.12), by the time of [[Augustus]], up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India:

{{quote|&quot;At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Ethiopia]], and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos to India, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise.&quot;|Strabo II.5.12. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html]}}

The port of Myos Hormos was connected to the Nile valley and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] by a Roman road, built in the 1st century.

After the 4th century the port was abandoned, because of the [[Roman Empire]] crisis and the end of the trade between [[Rome]] and India.

Only in the 17th century the port started to get again some importance, mainly because of holy travel from [[Cairo]] to [[Mecca]]. The city of old Qusair is the actual Myos Hormos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mar-rosso.it/index.php?cdmr=1&amp;id=136&amp;categoria=12 Articles and photos of Myos Hormos and actual Old Qusair (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ain Sokhna''' ({{lang-ar|العين السخنة}} ''{{transl|arz|El ʿĒn El Sokhna}}''  {{IPA-arz|elˈʕeːn esˈsoxnæ}}, &quot;the Hot Spring&quot;) is a town in the [[Suez Governorate]], lying on the western shore of the [[Red Sea]]'s [[Gulf of Suez]]. It is situated 55&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Suez]] and approximately 120&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Cairo]].

==History==
Recent archaeological excavations have shown that there was an ancient Egyptian port and settlement in this area. The site was first brought to attention in 1999 by Professor Mahmud Abd El Raziq.&lt;ref&gt;Abd el-Raziq M. 1999. ''New inscriptions at El-Ein el-Sukhna''. '''Memnonia''' 10: 125 –31&lt;/ref&gt; French and Egyptian archaeologists have been investigating this area since that time.

As early as the Old Kingdom, seafaring expeditions on the Red Sea were organized from this port. Similar material was also found at the [[Wadi Maghareh]], where many Old Kingdom inscriptions are found.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Tallet, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Tallet.pdf ''Ayn Sukhna and Wadi el-Jarf: Two newly discovered pharaonic harbours on the Suez Gulf.'' (PDF file)] British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan 18 (2012): 147–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh), as the [[climate of Egypt|rest of Egypt]].

'''Letopolis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Λητοῦς Πόλις) was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian city, the capital of the second [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]].

The site and its deity are mentioned in texts from as far back as the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181 BC), and a temple to the god probably stood there very early in Egyptian history. The only known monuments at the site, however, date to the reigns of pharaohs from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (664–332 BC): [[Necho II]], [[Psamtik II]], [[Hakor]], and [[Nectanebo I]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">'''Mazghuna''' (also known as ''Al Mazghunah'' or ''Al-Muzghumah''), 5&amp;nbsp;km to the south of [[Dahshur]], is the site of several mudbrick [[pyramid]]s dating from the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]]. The area was explored by [[Ernest Mackay]] in 1910, and was excavated by [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1911. [[Amenemhet IV]] and [[Sobekneferu]] have been suggested as the owners of 2 unfinished pyramids at Mazghuna but there is no conclusive evidence of this. The [[Southern Mazghuna pyramid|southern pyramid]] is about 3 miles from [[Sneferu]]'s [[bent pyramid]]. The base was 52.5 meters square but it was never finished. The outer burial chamber contains an inner monolithic burial vault made out of quartzite like the one for Amenemhet III at Hawara.  There was a large granite plug ready to slide over the top however it was never used since no one was ever buried there.

There was [[Northern Mazghuna pyramid|a second pyramid planned at north Mazghuna]] even larger than this one but the superstructure was never begun. There was a U shaped passage leading to the burial chamber which contains another monolithic burial vault. There was scarcely 2&amp;nbsp;cm (less than 1&amp;nbsp;inch) clearance between the vault and the chamber. There was a 42-ton quartzite slab waiting to be slid over the burial chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark The Complete Pyramids, London: Thames and Hudson (1997)p.184-5 {{ISBN|0-500-05084-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
The [[Amelia Peabody series|Amelia Peabody]] mystery ''[[The Mummy Case]]'' (by [[Elizabeth Peters]]) was set in Mazghuna.

'''Luxor Temple''' is a large [[Ancient Egyptian temple]] complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the [[Egyptian language]] it is known as ''ipet resyt'', &quot;the southern sanctuary&quot;. In Luxor there are several great temples on the east and west banks.  Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers and tourists include the [[Mortuary Temple of Seti I|Temple of Seti I]] at [[Kurna|Gurnah]], the [[Temple of Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el Bahri]], the Temple of [[Ramesses II]] (a.k.a. [[Ramesseum]]), and the Temple of [[Ramesses III]] at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]]; and the two primary cults temples on the east bank are known as the [[Karnak]] and Luxor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science&quot;&gt;Science, &quot;Excavation of the Temple of Luxor,&quot; Science, 6, no. 6 (1885): 370.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death.  Instead Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the kings of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of [[Alexander the Great]] who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo.)

To the rear of the temple are chapels built by [[Amenhotep III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by [[Tutankhamun]] and Ramesses II. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area.

==Construction==
[[File:LuxorTemple,OriginalObelisks.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original two obelisks, as seen in 1832. The one on the right is now in Paris, known as the [[Luxor Obelisk]].]]
Luxor temple was built with sandstone from the [[Gebel el-Silsila]] area, which is  located in South-Western Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd&quot;&gt;Bernd Fitzner, Kurt Heinrichs, and Dennis La Bouchardiere, &quot;Weathering damage on Pharaonic sandstone monuments in Luxor-Egypt,&quot; Building and Environment, 38 (2003): 1089.&lt;/ref&gt; This sandstone from the  Gebel el-Silsila region is referred to as Nubian Sandstone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd&quot;/&gt; This sandstone was used for the construction for monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd&quot;/&gt;

Like other Egyptian structures a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;Alexander Badawy, &quot;Illusionism in Egyptian Architecture,&quot; Studies in the Ancient Oriental Civilization, 35 (1969): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis Jackal was really Anubis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt; At the Luxor temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt; With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;

==Excavation==
From medieval times the Muslim population of [[Luxor]] had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science&quot;/&gt; Due to the Luxor’s past city population building on top of and around the Luxor temple, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to 15 metres (48- 50 ft) in height.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science&quot;/&gt; The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor [[Gaston Maspero]] after 1884 after he had been given the order to commence operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science&quot;/&gt; The excavations were carried out sporadically until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the Modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had taken over the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies.

==Festivals==
It has been determined that the Luxor temple holds great significance to the [[Opet Festival]]. The Luxor Temple was dedicated to the [[Theban Triad]] of the cult of the Royal Ka, [[Amun]], [[Mut]], and [[Khonsu]] and was built during the [[New Kingdom]], the focus of the annual [[Opet Festival]], in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby [[Karnak Temple]] (''ipet-isut'') to stay there for a while, with his consort Mut, in a celebration of fertility – hence its name. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanny&quot;&gt;Lanny Bell, &quot;Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka,&quot; Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 44, no. 4 (1985): 251.&lt;/ref&gt; They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanny&quot;/&gt; Examples of the cult, of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka.

==Shrine stations==
Six [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]] shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the [[Karnak Temple|Karnak]] and Luxor Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;&gt;Charles Nims, &quot;Places about Thebes,&quot; Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 14, no. 2 (1955): 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The avenue which went in a straight line between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was recently{{when|date=January 2012}} lined with human-headed sphinxes of Nekhtanebo I,21, in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;/&gt; Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;/&gt; Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;/&gt; The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;/&gt; Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles&quot;/&gt;

==Defacement==
{{main article|Ding Jinhao engraving scandal}}
In 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved graffiti that read &quot;Ding Jinhao was here&quot; ({{zh|s=丁锦昊到此一游}}) in [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The engraving has since been partially cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/travel/china-egypt/|title=Netizen outrage after Chinese tourist defaces Egyptian temple|author=Hiufu Wong, CNN|date=27 May 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memphis''' ({{lang-ar|مَنْف}} ''{{transl|ar|Manf}}''&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-arz|mænf|pron}}; {{lang-cop|ⲙⲉⲙϥⲓ}}; {{lang-el|Μέμφις}}) was the ancient capital of [[Aneb-Hetch]], the first [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]]. Its ruins are located near the town of Mit Rahina, 20&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Giza]].

According to legend related by [[Manetho]], the city was founded by the [[pharaoh]] [[Menes]]. [[List of Egyptian capitals|Capital]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Old Kingdom]], it remained an important city throughout ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean history]].&lt;ref&gt;Bard, ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (2002). ''Private Life in New Kingdom Egypt''. Princeton University Press, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ian (2003). ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford University Press, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; It occupied a strategic position at the mouth of the [[Nile delta]], and was home to feverish activity. Its principal port, ''Peru-nefer'', harboured a high density of workshops, factories, and warehouses that distributed food and merchandise throughout the ancient kingdom. During its golden age, Memphis thrived as a regional centre for commerce, trade, and religion.

Memphis was believed to be under the protection of the god [[Ptah]], the patron of craftsmen. Its great [[Egyptian temple|temple]], ''Hut-ka-Ptah'' (meaning &quot;Enclosure of the [[Egyptian soul|ka]] of Ptah&quot;), was one of the most prominent structures in the city. The name of this temple, rendered in Greek as ''Aί-γυ-πτoς (Ai-gy-ptos)'' by the historian Manetho, is believed to be the etymological origin of the modern English name ''Egypt''.

The history of Memphis is closely linked to [[History of ancient Egypt|that of the country]] itself. Its eventual downfall is believed to be due to the loss of its [[economic]] significance in late antiquity, following the rise of coastal [[Alexandria]]. Its religious significance also diminished after the abandonment of the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient religion]] following the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The ruins of the former capital today offer fragmented evidence of its past. They have been preserved, along with the [[Giza pyramid complex|pyramid complex at Giza]], as a [[World Heritage Site]] since 1979. The site is open to the public as an [[open-air museum]].

==Toponymy==
{{Hiero | Memphis (mn nfr) | &lt;hiero&gt;mn:n nfr f:r O24 niwt&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=left | era=default}}

Memphis has had several names during its history of almost four millennia. Its [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] name was '''[[Aneb-Hetch|Inbu-Hedj]]''' (translated as &quot;the white walls&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.com/Memphis-City-White-Walls-Dimick-Univ/1280894368/bd M. T. Dimick] retrieved 14:19GMT 1.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/submit/name/memphis ''Etymology website''-www.behindthename.com] retrieved 14:22GMT 1.10.11&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Society: Egypt's Nile Valley Supplement Map'', produced by the Cartographic Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its size, the city also came to be known by various other names that were actually the names of neighbourhoods or districts that enjoyed considerable prominence at one time or another. For example, according to a text of the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hieratic Papyrus 1116A'', of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg; cf Scharff, ''Der historische Abschnitt der Lehre für König Merikarê'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; it was known as '''Djed-Sut''' (&quot;everlasting places&quot;), which is the name of the [[pyramid of Teti]].&lt;ref&gt;Montet, ''Géographie de l'Égypte ancienne'', (Vol I), p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was also at one point referred to as '''Ankh-Tawy''' (meaning &quot;Life of the Two Lands&quot;), stressing the strategic position of the city between [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]]. This name appears to date from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055–1640 BCE), and is frequently found in ancient Egyptian texts.&lt;ref&gt;Najovits, Simson R. ''Egypt, trunk of the tree: a modern survey of an ancient land'' (Vol. 1–2), Algora Publishing, p171.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars maintain that this name was actually that of the western district of the city that lay between the great Temple of Ptah and the necropolis at [[Saqqara]], an area that contained a sacred tree.&lt;ref&gt;Montet, ''Géographie de l'Égypte ancienne'', (Vol I), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550 BCE), the city became known as '''Men-nefer''' (meaning &quot;enduring and beautiful&quot;), which became &quot;'''Menfe'''&quot; ({{lang|cop|ⲙⲉⲙϥⲓ}}) in [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. The name &quot;'''Memphis'''&quot; ({{lang|grc|Μέμφις}}) is the [[Greek language|Greek]] adaptation of this name, which was originally the name of the [[Mortuary complex of Pepi I|pyramid of Pepi I]],{{#tag:ref|&lt;hiero&gt;&lt;- p p i i -&gt; Y5:N35-F35-O24&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Ppj-mn-nfr'' = Pepi-men-nefer (&quot;Pepi is perfection&quot;, or &quot;Pepi is beauty&quot;).|group=Fnt|name=hieropepi}} located west of the city.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Bridget (2001). ''Decoding Egyptian Hieroglyphs: How to Read the Secret Language of the Pharaohs''. Chronicle Books , p.130&lt;/ref&gt; However, Greek poet [[Hesiod]] at his ''[[Theogony]]'' refers that Memphis was a daughter of river god [[Nilus (mythology)|Nilus]] and the wife of [[Epaphus]] (the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Io (mythology)|Io]]), who founded the city and named it after his wife's name.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Β 1,4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bible, Memphis is called ''Moph'' or ''Noph''.

===Location===
The city of Memphis is {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Cairo]], on the west bank of the [[Nile]]. The modern cities and towns of Mit Rahina, [[Dahshur]], [[Abusir]], [[Abu Gorab]], and [[Zawyet el'Aryan]], south of Cairo, all lie within the administrative borders of historical Memphis ({{coord|29|50|58.8|N|31|15|15.4|E|type:landmark}}). The city was also the place that marked the boundary between Upper and Lower Egypt. (The 22nd nome of Upper Egypt and 1st nome of Lower Egypt).

===Population===
The island of the city is today uninhabited. The closest settlement is the town of Mit Rahina. Estimates of historical population size differ widely between sources. According to [[Tertius Chandler]], Memphis had some 30,000 inhabitants and was by far the largest settlement worldwide from the time of its foundation until around 2250 BCE and from 1557 to 1400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Tertius ( thertgreg1987). ''Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth''.&lt;/ref&gt; K. A. Bard is more cautious and estimates the city's population to have amounted to about 6,000 inhabitants during the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Egyptian - Nefertem - Walters 541972.jpg|right|thumb|125px|This ritualistic object depicts the [[Nefertem|god Nefertem]], who was mainly worshipped in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21678
 |title= Nefertem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]

Memphis became the capital of Ancient Egypt for over eight consecutive [[List of Ancient Egyptian dynasties|dynasties]] during the Old Kingdom. The city reached a peak of prestige under the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]] as a centre for the worship of [[Ptah]], the god of creation and artworks. The alabaster [[sphinx]] that guards the Temple of Ptah serves as a memorial of the city's former power and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Society: Egypt's Nile Valley Supplement Map''. (Produced by the Cartographic Division)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David (1995). ''National Geographic: Egypt's Old Kingdom'', Vol. 187, Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Memphis [[Triple deities|triad]], consisting of the creator god Ptah, his consort [[Sekhmet]], and their son [[Nefertem]], formed the main focus of worship in the city.

Memphis declined briefly after the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] with the rise of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the New Kingdom, and was revived under the [[History of Persian Egypt|Persians]] before falling firmly into second place following the foundation of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. Under the [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman Empire]], Alexandria remained the most important Egyptian city. Memphis remained the second city of Egypt until the establishment of [[Fustat]] (or Fostat) in 641 CE. It was then largely abandoned and became a source of stone for the surrounding settlements. It was still an imposing set of ruins in the 12th century but soon became a little more than an expanse of low ruins and scattered stone.

[[File:Ramesses-Ptah-Sekhmet.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rameses II flanked by Ptah and Sekhmet.]]

===Legendary history===
The legend recorded by [[Manetho]] was that [[Menes]], the first pharaoh to unite the [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Two Lands]], established his capital on the banks of the [[Nile]] by diverting the river with dikes. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who tells a similar story, relates that during his visit to the city, the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], at that point the [[suzerainty|suzerains]] of the country, paid particular attention to the condition of these dams so that the city was saved from the [[Flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herod99&quot;&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' (Vol II), § 99&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been theorised that Menes was possibly a mythical king, similar to [[Romulus]] of Rome. Some scholars suggest that Egypt most likely became unified through mutual need, developing cultural ties and trading partnerships, although it is undisputed that the first capital of united Egypt was the city of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Manley, Bill (1997). ''The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Egypt''. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptologists have also identified the legendary Menes with the historical [[Narmer]], who is represented in the [[Palette of Narmer]] conquering the Nile delta in Lower Egypt and establishing himself as pharaoh. This palette has been dated to ca. 31st century BC, and would thus correlate with the story of Egypt's unification by Menes. However, in 2012 an inscription depicting the visit of the predynastic king [[Iry-Hor]] to Memphis was discovered in the Sinai.&lt;ref name=&quot;talle&quot;/&gt; Since Iry-Hor predates Narmer by two generations, the latter cannot have been the founder of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;talle&quot;/&gt;

===Old Kingdom===
Little is known about the city of the [[Old Kingdom]]. It was the state capital of the godlike pharaohs, who reigned from Memphis from the date of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st dynasty]]. During the earliest years of the reign of Menes, according to Manetho, the seat of power was further to the south, at [[Thinis]].

According to Manetho, ancient sources suggest the &quot;white walls&quot; (Ineb-hedj) were founded by Menes. Referred to in some texts as the &quot;Fortress of the White Wall&quot;, it is likely that the king established himself here to better control this new union between the two rival kingdoms. The complex of [[Pyramid of Djoser|Djoser]] of the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]], located in the ancient necropolis at [[Saqqara]], would then be the royal funerary chamber, housing all the elements necessary to royalty: temples, shrines, ceremonial courts, palaces and barracks.

The [[golden age]] began with the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]], which seems to have furthered the primary role of Memphis as a royal residence where rulers received the [[Pschent|double crown]], the divine manifestation of the unification of the Two Lands. Coronations and jubilees such as the [[Sed festival]] were celebrated in the temple of Ptah. The earliest signs of such ceremonies were found in the chambers of Djoser.

It was also during this period that developed the clergy of the temple of Ptah. The importance of the shrine is attested in this period with payments of food and other goods necessary for the funerary rites of royal and noble dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, ''Ancient Records of Egypt'', p. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; This shrine is also cited in the annals preserved on the [[Palermo Stone]], and beginning from the reign of [[Menkaura]], we know the names of the [[High Priest of Ptah|high priests]] of Memphis that seem to work in pairs at least until the reign of [[Teti]].

The architecture of this period was similar to that seen at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]], royal necropolis of the Fourth dynasty, where recent excavations have revealed that the essential focus of the kingdom at that time centred on the construction of the royal tomb. A strong suggestion of this notion is the etymology of the name of the city itself, which matched that of the [[pyramid of Pepi I]] of the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]]. Memphis was then the heir to a long artistic and architectural practice, constantly encouraged by the monuments of preceding reigns.

[[File:GD-EG-Memphis009.JPG|thumb|200px|Sculpture from the Middle Kingdom restored in the name of Rameses II.]]

All these [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] were surrounded by camps inhabited by craftsmen and labourers, dedicated exclusively to the construction of royal tombs. Spread over several kilometres stretching in all directions, Memphis formed a true [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], with temples connected by sacred [[temenos]], and ports connected by roadways and canals.&lt;ref&gt;Goyon, ''Les ports des Pyramides et le Grand Canal de Memphis'', p. 137–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The perimeter of the city thus gradually extended into a vast urban sprawl. Its centre remained around the temple complex of Ptah.

===Middle Kingdom===
In the beginning of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the capital and court of the pharaoh had moved to Thebes in the south, leaving Memphis for a time in the shade. Although the seat of political power had been shifted, however, Memphis remained perhaps the most important commercial and artistic centre, as evidenced by the discovery of handicrafts districts and cemeteries, located west of the temple of Ptah.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hitta, ''Excavations at Memphis of Kom el-Fakhri'', p. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also found were vestiges attesting to the architectural focus of this time. A large granite offering table on behalf of [[Amenemhat I]] mentioned the erection by the king of a shrine to the god Ptah, master of Truth.&lt;ref&gt;Mariette, ''Monuments divers Collected in Egypt and in Nubia'', p. 9 and plate 34A.&lt;/ref&gt; Other blocks registered in the name of [[Amenemhat II]] were found to be used as foundations for large monoliths preceding the pylons of Rameses II. These kings were also known to have ordered mining expeditions, raids or military campaigns beyond the borders, erecting monuments or statues to the consecration of deities, evinced by a panel recording official acts of the royal court during this time. In the ruins of the Temple of Ptah, a block in the name of [[Senusret II]] bears an inscription indicating an architectural commission as a gift to the gods of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Mariette, ''Monuments divers Collected in Egypt and in Nubia'', § Temple of Ptah, excavations 1871, 1872 and 1875, p. 7 and plate 27A.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many statues found at the site, later restored by the New Kingdom pharaohs, are attributed to pharaohs of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]]. Examples include the two stone giants that have been recovered amidst the temple ruins, which were later restored under the name of Rameses II.&lt;ref&gt;Brugsch, ''Collection of Egyptian monuments'', Part I, p. 4 and Plate II. This statue is now on display at the Egyptian Museum in Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, according to the tradition recorded by Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' (Vol II), § 101.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Bibliotheca historica'', (Vol I), Ch. 2, § 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amenemhet III]] built the northern gate of the Temple of Ptah. Remains attributed to this pharaoh were indeed found during the excavations in this area conducted by [[Flinders Petrie]], who confirmed the connection. It is also worth noting that, during this time, [[mastaba]]s of the high priests of Ptah were constructed near the royal pyramids at Saqqara, showing that the royalty and the clergy of Memphis at that time were closely linked. The [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|13th dynasty]] continued this trend, and some pharaohs of this line were buried at Saqqara, attesting that Memphis retained its place at the heart of the monarchy.

With the invasion of the [[Hyksos]], and their rise to power ca. 1650 BC, the city of Memphis came under siege. Following its capture, many monuments and statues of the ancient capital and were dismantled, looted or damaged by the Hyksos kings, who later carried them to adorn their new capital at [[Avaris]].{{#tag:ref|Most of these relics would be subsequently recovered by Rameses II in order to decorate his new capital at Pi-Rameses. They were later moved again during the Third Intermediate Period to Tanis, and many have been found scattered among the ruins of the country's various ancient capitals.|group=Fnt|name=hyksos}} Evidence of royal propaganda has been uncovered and attributed to the Theban kings of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|17th dynasty]], who initiated the reconquest of the kingdom half a century later.

===New Kingdom===
The [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] thus opened with the victory over the invaders by the Thebans. Although the reigns of [[Amenhotep II]] (r. 1427–1401/1397 BC) and [[Thutmose IV]] (r. 1401/1397–1391/1388 BC) saw considerable royal focus in Memphis, power remained for the most part in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrol, ''Amenhotep III le magnifique'', Part II, Ch. 1, p. 210–214.&lt;/ref&gt; With the long period of peace that followed, prosperity again took hold of the city, which benefited from her strategic position. Strengthening trade ties with other empires meant that the port of ''Peru-nefer'' (literally means &quot;Bon Voyage&quot;) became the gateway to the kingdom for neighbouring regions, including [[Byblos]] and the [[Levant]].

In the [[New Kingdom]], Memphis became a centre for the education of royal princes and the sons of the nobility. Amenhotep II, born and raised in Memphis, was made the ''setem''—the high priest over Lower Egypt—during the reign of his father. His son, Thutmose IV received his famed and recorded [[Dream Stele|dream]] whilst residing as a young prince in Memphis. During his exploration of the site, [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] identified a series of blocks and broken colonnades in the name of Thutmose IV to the east of the Temple of Ptah. They had to belong to a royal building, most likely a ceremonial palace.

The founding of the temple of [[Astarte]] (Mespotamian/Assyrian goddess of fertility and war; Babylonian = Ishtar), which Herodotus mistakes as being dedicated to the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]], may also be dated to the 18th dynasty, specifically the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] (r. 1388/86–1351/1349 BC). The greatest work of this pharaoh in Memphis, however, was a temple called &quot;Nebmaatra united with Ptah&quot;, which is cited by many sources from the period of his reign, including artefacts listing the works of [[Amenhotep (Huy)|Huy]], the High Steward of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Memphis and Maydum III'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of this temple has not been precisely determined, but a number of its brown quartzite blocks were found to have been reused by Ramesses II (r. 1279–1213 BC) for the construction of the small temple of Ptah. This leads some Egyptologists to suggest that the latter temple had been built over the site of the first.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrol, ''Amenhotep III le magnifique'', Part II, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to inscriptions found in Memphis, [[Akhenaten]] (r. 1353/51–1336/34 BC; formerly Amenhotep IV) founded a temple of [[Aten]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Mariette, ''Monuments divers collected in Egypt and in Nubia'', p. 7 &amp; 10, and plates 27 (fig. E) &amp; 35 (fig. E1, E2, E3).&lt;/ref&gt; The burial chamber of one of the priests of this cult has been uncovered at Saqqara.&lt;ref&gt;Löhr, ''Aḫanjāti in Memphis'', p. 139–187.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Tutankhamun]] (r. 1332–1323 BC; formerly Tutankhaten) relocated the royal court from Akhenaten's capital [[Amarna|Akhetaten]] (&quot;Horizon of the Aten&quot;) to Memphis before the end of the second year of his reign. Whilst in Memphis, Tutankhamun initiated a period of restoration of the temples and traditions following the monotheistic era of [[Atenism]], which was regarded as [[heresy]].

The tombs of important officials from his reign, such as [[Horemheb]] and [[Maya (Egyptian)|Maya]], are situated in Saqqara, although Horemheb was eventually buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]] after reigning as pharaoh himself (r. 1319–1292 BC). He had been Commander of the Army under Tutankhamun and Ay. Maya was Overseer of the Treasury during the reigns of Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb. Ay had been Tutankhamun's chief minister, and succeeded him as pharaoh (r. 1323–1319 BC). To consolidate his power he married Tutankhamun's widow Ankhesenamun, the third of the six daughters of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. Her fate is unknown. Horemheb did likewise when he married Nefertiti's sister Mutnodjemet.

There is evidence that, under [[Ramesses II]], the city developed new importance in the political sphere through its proximity to the new capital [[Pi-Ramesses]]. The pharaoh devoted many monuments in Memphis and adorned them with colossal symbols of glory. [[Merneptah]] (r. 1213–1203 BC), his successor, constructed a palace and developed the southeast wall of the temple of Ptah. For the early part of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], Memphis received the privileges of royal attention, and it is this dynasty that is most evident among the ruins of the city today.

[[File:Grand pretre Ptah Sheshonq.jpg|thumb|150px|Relief representing the [[High Priest of Ptah]], Shoshenq.]]

With the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st]] and [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd dynasties]], we see a continuation of the religious development initiated by Ramesses. Memphis does not seem to suffer a decline during the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]], which saw great changes in the geopolitics of the country. Instead it is likely that the pharaohs worked to develop the Memphite cult in their new capital of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], to the northeast. In light of some remains found at the site, it is known that a temple of Ptah was based there. [[Siamun]] is cited as having built a temple dedicated to [[Amun]], the remains of which were found by Flinders Petrie in the early 20th century, in the south of the temple of Ptah complex.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Memphis I'', Ch. VI, § 38, p. 12; plates 30 &amp; 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to inscriptions describing his architectural work, [[Sheshonk I]] (r. 943–922 BC), founder of the 22nd dynasty, constructed a forecourt and pylon of the temple of Ptah, a monument which he called the &quot;Castle of Millions of Years of Sheshonk, Beloved of Amun&quot;. The funerary cult surrounding this monument, well known in the New Kingdom, was still functioning several generations after its establishment at the temple, leading some scholars to suggest that it may have contained the royal burial chamber of the pharaoh himself.&lt;ref&gt;Sagrillo, ''Mummy of Shoshenq I Re-discovered?'', p. 95–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheshonk also ordered the building of a new shrine for the god [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], especially devoted to funeral ceremonies in which the bull was led to his death to be ritually [[mummification|mummified]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Memphis I'', § 38, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maystre, ''The High Priests of Ptah of Memphis'', Ch. XVI, § 166, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

A necropolis for the high priests of Memphis dating precisely from the 22nd dynasty has been found west of the forum. It included a chapel dedicated to Ptah by a prince [[Shoshenq D|Shoshenq]], son of [[Osorkon II]] (r. 872–837 BC), whose tomb was found in Saqqara in 1939 by Pierre Montet. The chapel is currently visible in the gardens of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, behind a trio of colossi of Ramesses II, which are also from Memphis.

===Late Period===
During the Third Intermediate Period and the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], Memphis is often the scene of liberation struggles of the local dynasties against an occupying force, such as the Kushites, Assyrians and Persians.

The triumphant campaign of [[Piye|Piankhi]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]], saw the establishment of the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]], whose seat of power was in [[Napata]]. Piankhi's conquest of Egypt was recorded on the [[Victory Stele of Piye at Gebel Barkal|Victory Stele]] at the Temple of Amun in [[Jebel Barkal|Gebel Barkal]]. Following the capture of Memphis, he restored the temples and cults neglected during the [[Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt|reign of the Libyans]]. His successors are known for building for chapels in the southwest corner of the temple of Ptah.&lt;ref&gt;Meeks, ''Hommage à Serge Sauneron I'', p. 221–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memphis was at the heart of the turmoil produced by the great [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] threat. Under [[Taharqa]], the city formed the frontier base of the resistance, which soon crumbled as the Kushite king was driven back into [[Nubia]]. The Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]], supported by some of the native Egyptian princes, captured Memphis in 671 BCE. His forces sacked and raided the city, slaughtered villagers and erected piles of their heads. Esarhaddon returned to his capital [[Nineveh]] with rich booty, and erected a [[Victory stele of Esarhaddon|victory stele]] showing the son of Taharqa in chains. Almost as soon as the king left, Egypt rebelled against Assyrian rule.

[[File:Palais Apries Memphis.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ruins of the palace of Apries, in Memphis.]]

In Assyria, [[Ashurbanipal]] succeeded his father and resumed the offensive against Egypt. In a massive invasion in 664 BCE, the city of Memphis was again sacked and looted, and the king [[Tantamani]] was pursued into Nubia and defeated, putting a definitive end to the Kushite reign over Egypt. Power then returned to the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Saite pharaohs]], who, fearful of an invasion from the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], reconstructed and even fortified structures in the city, as is attested by the palace built by [[Apries]].

Egypt and Memphis were taken for [[Persia]] by king [[Cambysis]] in 525 BC after the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|Battle of Pelusium]]. Under the [[History of Persian Egypt|Persians]], structures in the city were preserved and strengthened, and Memphis was made the administrative headquarters of the newly conquered [[satrap]]y. A Persian garrison was permanently installed within the city, probably in the great north wall, near the domineering palace of Apries. The excavations by Flinders Petrie revealed that this sector included armouries. For almost a century and a half, the city remained the capital of the [[Persia]]n satrapy of Egypt (&quot;Mudraya&quot;/&quot;Musraya&quot;), officially becoming one of the epicentres of commerce in the vast territory conquered by the Achaemenid monarchy.

The steles dedicated to Apis in the Serapeum at Saqqara, commissioned by the reigning monarch, represent a key element in understanding the events of this period. As in the Late Period, the catacombs in which the remains of the sacred bulls were buried gradually grew in size, and later took on a monumental appearance that confirms the growth of the cult's hypostases throughout the country, and particularly in Memphis and its necropolis. Thus, a monument dedicated by [[Cambyses II]] seems to refute the testimony of Herodotus, who lends the conquerors a criminal attitude of disrespect against the sacred traditions.

The nationalist awakening came with the rise to power, however briefly, of [[Amyrtaeus]] in 404 BCE, who ended the Persian occupation. He was defeated and executed at Memphis in October 399 BCE by [[Nepherites I]], founder of the [[Twenty-ninth dynasty of Egypt|29th dynasty]]. The execution was recorded in an Aramaic papyrus document (Papyrus Brooklyn 13). Nepherites moved the capital to [[Mendes]], in the eastern delta, and Memphis lost its status in the political sphere. It retained, however, its religious, commercial, and strategic importance, and was instrumental in resisting Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt.

Under [[Nectanebo I]], a major rebuilding program was initiated for temples across the country. In Memphis, a powerful new wall was rebuilt for the Temple of Ptah, and developments were made to temples and chapels inside the complex. [[Nectanebo II]] meanwhile, while continuing the work of his predecessor, began building large sanctuaries, especially in the necropolis of Saqqara, adorning them with pylons, statues and paved roads lined with rows of sphinxes. Despite his efforts to prevent the recovery of the country by the Persians, he succumbed to a massive invasion in 343 BCE, and was defeated at [[Pelusium]]. Nectanebo II retreated south to Memphis, to which the emperor [[Artaxerxes III]] laid siege, forcing the pharaoh to flee to Upper Egypt, and eventually to Nubia.

A brief liberation of the city under the rebel-king [[Khabash|Khababash]] (338 to 335 BCE) is evinced by an Apis bull sarcophagus bearing his name, which was discovered at Saqqara dating from his second year. The armies of [[Darius III]] eventually regained control of the city.

Memphis under the Late Period saw recurring invasions followed by successive liberations. Several times besieged, it was the scene of several of the bloodiest battles in the history of the country. Despite the support of their Greek allies in undermining the hegemony of the Achaemenids, the country nevertheless fell into the hands of the conquerors, and Memphis was never again to become the nation's capital. In 332 BCE came the Greeks, who took control of the country from the Persians, and Egypt would never see a new native ruler ascend the pharaoh's throne until the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]].

===Ptolemaic Period===
[[File:Alexander visits the Apis bull at the temple in Memphis by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|180px|right|Alexander at the Temple of Apis in Memphis, by [[Andre Castaigne]] (1898–1899).]]

In 332 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] was crowned pharaoh in the Temple of Ptah, ushering in the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic period]]. The city retained a significant status, especially religious, throughout the period following the takeover by one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I of Egypt|Ptolemy]]. On the death of Alexander in Babylon (323 BCE), Ptolemy took great pains in acquiring his body and bringing it to Memphis. Claiming that the king himself had officially expressed a desire to be buried in Egypt, he then carried the body of Alexander to the heart of the temple of Ptah, and had him embalmed by the priests. By custom, kings in [[Macedon]] asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]] later transferred the [[sarcophagus]] to Alexandria, where a royal tomb was constructed for its burial. The exact location of the tomb has been lost since then. According to [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], the seer [[Aristander]] foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest &quot;would be happy and unvanquishable forever&quot;.

Thus began the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], during which began the city's gradual decline. It was Ptolemy I who first introduced the cult of [[Serapis]] in Egypt, establishing his cult in Saqqara. From this period date many developments of the Saqqara Serapeum, including the building of the Chamber of Poets, as well as the ''dromos'' adorning the temple, and many elements of Greek-inspired architecture. The cult's reputation extended beyond the borders of the country, but was later eclipsed by the great [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Alexandrian Serapeum]], built in Ptolemy's honour by his successors.

The [[Ptolemaic Decrees|Decrees of Memphis]] were issued in 216 and 196 BCE, by [[Ptolemy IV]] and [[Ptolemy V]] respectively. Delegates from the principal clergies of the kingdom gathered in [[synod]], under the patronage of the High Priest of Ptah and in the presence of the pharaoh, to establish the religious policy of the country for years to come, also dictating fees and taxes, creating new foundations, and paying tribute to the Ptolemaic rulers. These decrees were engraved on [[stele|stelae]] in three scripts to be read and understood by all: [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], and [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]. The most famous of these stelae is the [[Rosetta Stone]], which allowed the deciphering of ancient Egyptian script in the 19th century.

There were other stelae, funerary this time, discovered on the site that have forwarded knowledge of the genealogy of the higher clergy of Memphis, a dynasty of high priests of Ptah. The lineage retained strong ties with the royal family in Alexandria, to the extent that marriages occurred between certain high priests and Ptolemaic princesses, strengthening even further the commitment between the two families.

===Decline and abandonment===
With the arrival of the [[History of Roman Egypt|Romans]], Memphis, like Thebes, lost its place permanently in favour of [[Alexandria]], which opened onto the empire. The rise of the cult of [[Serapis]], a syncretic deity most suited to the mentality of the new rulers of Egypt, and the emergence of [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] taking root deep into the country, spelled the complete ruin of the ancient cults of Memphis.

Gradually, the city dropped out of existence during the [[Byzantine Egypt#Byzantine Egypt|Byzantine]] and [[Copt]]ic periods. The city then became a quarry to build new settlements nearby, including a [[Fustat|new capital]] founded by the [[Arab]]s who [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|took possession]] in the 7th century. The foundations of [[Fustat]] and later Cairo, both built further north, were laid with stones of dismantled temples and ancient necropoleis of Memphis. In the 13th century, the Arab chronicler [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-ul-Latif]], upon visiting the site, describes and gives testimony to the grandeur of the ruins.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Enormous as are the extent and antiquity of this city, in spite of the frequent change of governments whose yoke it has borne, and the great pains more than one nation has been at to destroy it, to sweep its last trace from the face of the earth, to carry away the stones and materials of which it was constructed, to mutilate the statues which adorned it; in spite, finally, of all that more than four thousand years have done in addition to man, these ruins still offer to the eye of the beholder a mass of marvels which bewilder the senses and which the most skillful pens must fail to describe. The more deeply we contemplate this city the more our admiration rises, and every fresh glance at the ruins is a fresh source of delight ... The ruins of Memphis hold a half-day's journey in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne &amp; Isambert, ''Itinéraire descriptif, historique et archéologique de l'Orient'', p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, ''Histoire ancienne des peuples de l'Orient'', Ch. I, § Origine des Égyptiens.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the remains today are nothing compared to what was witnessed by the Arab historian, his testimony has inspired the work of many archaeologists. The first surveys and excavations of the 19th century, and the extensive work of [[Flinders Petrie]], have been able to show a little of the ancient capital's former glory. Memphis and its necropolis, which include funerary rock tombs, mastabas, temples and pyramids, were inscribed on the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] of UNESCO in 1979.

==Remains==
During the time of the New Kingdom, and especially under the reign of the rulers of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], Memphis flourished in power and size, rivalling Thebes both politically and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecturally]]. An indicator of this development can be found in a chapel of [[Seti I]] dedicated to the worship of Ptah. After over a century of excavations on the site, archaeologists have gradually been able to confirm the layout and expansion of the ancient city.

===Great Temple of Ptah===
[[File:Memphis-temple-Ptah.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's depiction of the western forecourt of the Great Temple of Ptah at Memphis.]]

The ''Hout-ka-Ptah'',{{#tag:ref|&lt;hiero&gt;Q3:X1-V28-O6-X1:O1-D28-O49&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''ḥw.t-k3-Ptḥ'' = Hout-ka-Ptah|group=Fnt|name=hierogtop}} dedicated to the worship of the creator god [[Ptah]], was the largest and most important temple in ancient Memphis. It was one of the most prominent structures in the city, occupying a large precinct within the city's centre. Enriched by centuries of veneration, the temple was one of the three foremost places of worship in Ancient Egypt, the others being the great temples of [[Ra]] in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and of [[Amun]] in Thebes.

Much of what is known about the ancient temple today comes from the writings of Herodotus, who visited the site at the time of the first Persian invasion, long after the fall of the New Kingdom. Herodotus claimed that the temple had been founded by [[Menes]] himself, and that the core building of the complex was restricted to priests and kings.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' (Vol II), § 99.&lt;/ref&gt; His account, however, gives no physical description of the complex. Archaeological work undertaken in the last century has gradually unearthed the temple's ruins, revealing a huge walled compound accessible by several monumental gates located along the southern, western and eastern walls.

The remains of the great temple and its premises are displayed as an open-air museum near the great [[#Statues of Rameses II|colossus]] of Rameses II, which originally marked the southern axis of the temple. Also in this sector is a large [[sphinx]] monolith, discovered in the 19th century. It dates from the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], most likely having been carved during the reign of either [[Amenhotep II]] or [[Thutmose IV]]. It is one of the finest examples of this kind statuary still present on its original site.

The outdoor museum houses numerous other statues, colossi, sphinxes, and architectural elements. However, the majority of the finds have been sold to major museums around the world. For the most part, these can be found on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.

The specific appearance of the temple is unclear at present, and only that of the main access to the perimeter are known. Recent developments include the discovery of giant statues which adorned the gates or towers. Those that have been found date from the reign of Ramsses II. This pharaoh also built at least three shrines within the temple compound, where worship is associated with those deities to whom they were dedicated.

===Temple of Ptah of Rameses II===
This small temple, adjoining the southwest corner of the larger Temple of Ptah, was dedicated to the deified Rameses II, along with the three state gods: Horus, Ptah and Amun. It is known in full as the Temple of Ptah of Rameses, Beloved of Amun, God, Ruler of Heliopolis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes, ''Mit Rahineh'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its ruins were discovered in 1942, by archaeologist Ahmed Badawy, and were excavated in 1955 by Rudolf Anthes. The excavations uncovered a religious building complete with a tower, a courtyard for ritual offerings, a portico with columns followed by a pillared hall and a tripartite sanctuary, all enclosed in walls built of mud bricks. Its most recent exterior has been dated from the New Kingdom era.

The temple opened to the east towards a path paved with other religious buildings. The archaeological explorations that took place here reveal that the southern part of the city indeed contain a large number of religious buildings with a particular devotion to the god Ptah, the principal god of Memphis.

===Temple of Ptah and Sekhmet of Rameses II===
Located further east, and near to the great colossus of Rameses, this small temple is attributed to the 19th dynasty, and seems to have been dedicated to Ptah and his divine consort [[Sekhmet]], as well as deified Rameses II. Its ruins are not as well preserved as others nearby, as its limestone foundations appear to have been quarried after the abandonment of the city in late antiquity.
[[File:MerenptahOfferingtoPtah.jpg|thumb|180px|Column depicting Merenptah making an offering to Ptah.]]

Two giant statues, dating from the Middle Kingdom, originally adorned the building's facade, which opened to the west. They were moved inside the Museum of Memphis, and depicted the pharaoh standing in the attitude of the march, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt, [[Hedjet]].

===Temple of Ptah of Merneptah===
In the southeast of the Great Temple complex, the pharaoh [[Merneptah]], of the 19th dynasty, founded a new shrine in honour of the chief god of the city, Ptah. This temple was discovered in the early 20th century by Flinders Petrie, who identified a depiction of the Greek god [[Proteus]] cited by Herodotus.

The site was excavated during the First World War by Clarence Stanley Fisher. Excavations began in the anterior part, which is formed by a large courtyard of about 15 sq metres, opening on the south by a large door with reliefs supplying the names of the pharaoh and the epithets of Ptah. Only this part of the temple has been unearthed; the remainder of the chamber has yet to be explored a little further north. During the excavations, archaeologists unearthed the first traces of an edifice built of mud brick, which quickly proved to be a large ceremonial palace built alongside the temple proper. Some of the key elements of the stone temple were donated by Egypt to the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|museum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which financed the expedition, while the other remained at the [[Egyptian Museum|Museum in Cairo]].

The temple remained in use throughout the rest of the New Kingdom, as evidenced by enrolment surges during the reigns of later pharaohs. Thereafter, however, it was gradually abandoned and converted for other uses by civilians. Gradually buried by the activity of the city, the stratigraphic study of the site shows that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] it was already in ruins and is soon covered by new buildings.

[[File:Temple d'Hathor pano.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The ruins of the temple of Hathor of Memphis.]]

===Temple of Hathor===
This small temple of Hathor was unearthed south of the great wall of the Hout-Ka-Ptah by Abdullah al-Sayed Mahmud in the 1970s and also dates from the time of Rameses II.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Mahmud, ''A new temple for Hathor at Memphis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to the goddess [[Hathor]], Lady of the Sycamore, it presents an architecture similar to the small temple-shrines known especially to [[Karnak]]. From its proportions, it does not seem to be a major shrine of the goddess, but is currently the only building dedicated to her discovered in the city's ruins.

It is believed that this shrine was primarily used for processional purposes during major religious festivals. A larger temple dedicated to Hathor, indeed one of the foremost shrines of the goddess in the country, is thought to have existed elsewhere in the city, but to date has not been discovered. A depression, similar to that found near the great temple of Ptah, could indicate its location. Archaeologists believe that it could house the remains of an enclosure and a large monument, a theory attested by ancient sources.

===Other temples===
A temple dedicated to [[Mithras]], dated from the [[Roman Egypt|Roman period]], has been uncovered in the grounds north of Memphis. The temple of [[Astarte]], described by Herodotus, was located in the area reserved to the [[Phoenicians]] during the time when the Greek author visited the city. The temple of the goddess [[Neith]] was said to have been located to the north of the temple of Ptah. Neither of the latter two has been discovered to date.

Memphis is believed to have housed a number of other temples dedicated to gods who accompanied Ptah. Some of these sanctuaries are attested by ancient hieroglyphs, but have not yet been found among the ruins of the city. Surveys and excavations are still continuing at nearby Mit Rahina, and will likely add to the knowledge of the planning of the ancient religious city.

====Temple of Sekhmet====
A temple dedicated to the goddess [[Sekhmet]], consort of Ptah, has not yet been found but is currently certified by Egyptian sources. Archaeologists are still searching for remains.

It may be located within the precinct of the Hout-ka-Ptah, as would seem to suggest several discoveries made among the ruins of the complex in the late 19th century, including a block of stone evoking the &quot;great door&quot; with the epithet of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Brugsch, ''Collection of Egyptian monuments'', p. 6 and plate IV, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and a column bearing an inscription on behalf of Rameses II declaring him &quot;beloved of Sekhmet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brugsch, ''Collection of Egyptian monuments'', p. 8 and plate IV, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been demonstrated through the [[Papyrus Harris I|Great Harris Papyrus]], which states that a statue of the goddess was made alongside those of Ptah and their son, the god [[Nefertem]], during the reign of [[Rameses III]], and that it was commissioned for the gods of Memphis at the heart of the great temple.&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, ''Ancient Records of Egypt'', § 320 p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grandet, ''Le papyrus Harris I'', § 47,6 p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Louvres-antiquites-egyptiennes-p1020068.jpg|thumb|200px|A statue of the sacred bull, Apis, found at the Serapeum of Saqqara.]]

====Temple of Apis====
The Temple of Apis in Memphis was the main temple dedicated to the worship of the bull [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], considered to be a living manifestation of Ptah. It is detailed in the works of classical historians such as Herodotus, Diodorus, and [[Strabo]], but its location has yet to be discovered amidst the ruins of the ancient capital.

According to Herodotus, who described the temple's courtyard as a [[peristyle]] of columns with giant statues, it was built during the reign of [[Psammetichus I]].

The Greek historian [[Strabo]] visited the site with the conquering Roman troops, following the victory against [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]. He details that the temple consisted of two chambers, one for the bull and the other for his mother, and all was built near the temple of Ptah. At the temple, Apis was used as an [[oracle]], his movements being interpreted as [[prophecy|prophecies]]. His breath was believed to cure disease, and his presence to bless those around with virility. He was given a window in the temple through which he could be seen, and on certain holidays was led through the streets of the city, bedecked with jewellery and flowers.

In 1941, the archaeologist Ahmed Badawy discovered the first remains in Memphis which depicted the god Apis. The site, located within the grounds of the great temple of Ptah, was revealed to be a mortuary chamber designed exclusively for the [[embalming]] of the sacred bull. A [[stele]] found at Saqqara shows that [[Nectanebo II]] had ordered the restoration of this building, and elements dated from the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|30th dynasty]] have been unearthed in the northern part of the chamber, confirming the time of reconstruction in this part of the temple. It is likely that the mortuary was part of the larger temple of Apis cited by ancient sources. This sacred part of the temple would be the only part that has survived, and would confirm the words of Strabo and Diodorus, both of whom stated that the temple was located near the temple of Ptah.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The temple of Apis in Memphis'', p. 145–147.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siamun’s royal cartouche on a lintel.jpg|thumb|200px|Ankhefenmut kneels before the royal cartouche of Siamun, on a lintel from the Temple of Amun in Memphis.]]

The majority of known Apis statues come from the burial chambers known as [[Serapeum]], located to the northwest at Saqqara. The most ancient burials found at this site date back to the reign of [[Amenhotep III]].

====Temple of Amun====
During the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]], a shrine of the great god [[Amun]] was built by [[Siamun]] to the south of the temple of Ptah. This temple (or temples) was most likely dedicated to the [[Theban Triad]], consisting of Amun, his consort [[Mut]], and their son [[Khonsu]]. It was the Upper Egyptian counterpart of the Memphis Triad (Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertem).

====Temple of Aten====
A temple dedicated to [[Aten]] in Memphis is attested by hieroglyphs found within the tombs of Memphite dignitaries of the end of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], uncovered at Saqqara. Among them, that of [[Tutankhamun]], who began his career under the reign of [[Akhenaten]] as a &quot;steward of the temple of Aten in Memphis&quot;.

Since the early excavations at Memphis in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, artefacts have been uncovered in different parts of the city that indicate the presence of a building dedicated to the worship of the [[Sun (hieroglyph)|sun disc]]. The location of such a building is lost, and various hypotheses have been made on this subject based on the place of discovery of the remains of the [[Amarna]] period features.

===Statues of Rameses II===
[[File:Flickr - IDS.photos - Cairo sculptures, Egypt. (1).jpg|thumb|200px|left|The colossus of Rameses II in the open-air museum.]]

The ruins of ancient Memphis have yielded a large number of sculptures representing Pharaoh [[Rameses II]].

Within the museum in Memphis is a giant statue of the pharaoh carved of monumental [[limestone]], about 10 metres in length. It was discovered in 1820 near the southern gate of the temple of Ptah by Italian archaeologist [[Giovanni Battista Caviglia|Giovanni Caviglia]]. Because the base and feet of the sculpture are broken off from the rest of the body, it is currently displayed lying on its back. Some of the colours are still partially preserved, but the beauty of this statue lies in its flawless detail of the complex and subtle forms of human anatomy. The pharaoh wears the white crown of Upper Egypt, [[Hedjet]].

Caviglia offered to send the statue to Grand Duke of Tuscany, [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II]], through the mediation of [[Ippolito Rosellini]]. Rosellini advised the sovereign of the terrible expenses involved with transportation, and considered as necessary the cutting of the colossus into pieces. The [[Wāli]] and self-declared [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], offered to donate it to the [[British Museum]], but the museum declined the offer because of the difficult task of shipping the huge statue to London. It therefore remained in the archaeological area of Memphis in the museum built to protect it.

The colossus was one of a pair that historically adorned the eastern entrance to the temple of Ptah. [[Statue of Ramesses II (Mit Rahina)|The other]], found in the same year also by Caviglia, was restored in the 1950s to its full standing height of 11 metres. It was first displayed in the Bab Al-Hadid square in Cairo, which was subsequently renamed Ramses Square. Deemed an unsuitable location, it was moved in 2006 to a temporary location in [[Giza]], where it is currently undergoing restoration. It is due to be exhibited at the entrance of the [[Grand Egyptian Museum]], scheduled to open in 2018. A replica of the statues stands in [[Cairo]]'s [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|suburb of Heliopolis]].

===Saqqara, the Necropolis===
{{Main|Saqqara}}
[[File:Pyramid of Djoser.jpg|thumb|200px|The famed stepped [[Pyramid of Djoser]] at Saqqara, the Memphis necropolis.]]

Because of its antiquity and its large population, Memphis had several [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] spread along the valley, including the most famous, [[Saqqara]]. In addition, the urban area itself consisted of cemeteries that were constructed to the west of the great temple. The sanctity of these places inevitably attracted the devout and the faithful, who sought either to make an offering to [[Osiris]], or to bury another.

The part of town called ''Ankh-tawy'' was already included in the Middle Kingdom necropolis. Expansions of the western sector of the temple of Ptah were ordered by the pharaohs of the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd dynasty]], seeking to revive the past glory of the Ramesside age. Within this part of the site was founded a necropolis of the high priests.

According to sources, the site also included a chapel or an oratory to the goddess [[Bastet]], which seems consistent with the presence of monuments of rulers of the dynasty following the cult of [[Bubastis]]. Also in this area were the [[mortuary temple]]s devoted by various New Kingdom pharaohs, whose function is parallelled by Egyptologists to that played by the [[Temples of a Million years]] of the Theban pharaohs.

===Royal palaces===
Memphis was the seat of power for the pharaohs of over eight [[List of ancient Egyptian dynasties|dynasties]]. According to Manetho, the first royal palace was founded by [[Hor-Aha]], the successor of [[Narmer]], the founder of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st dynasty]]. He built a fortress in Memphis of white walls. Egyptian sources themselves tell of the palaces of the Old Kingdom rulers, some of which were built underneath major royal pyramids. They were immense in size, and were embellished with parks and lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Lalouette, ''Textes sacrés et textes profanes de l'Ancienne Égypte'' (Vol II), p. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the palaces described below, other sources indicate the existence of a palace founded in the city by [[Thutmose I]], which was still operating under the reign of [[Tuthmosis IV]].
[[File:Memphis200402.JPG|thumb|190px|left|The ruins of the palace of Apries, overlooking Memphis.]]

Merneptah, according to official texts of his reign, ordered the building of a large walled enclosure housing a new temple and adjoining palace.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' (Vol II), § 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The later pharaoh, [[Apries]], had a palatial complex constructed on a promontory overlooking the city. It was part of a series of structures built within the temple precinct in the Late Period, and contained a royal palace, a fortress, barracks and armouries. [[Flinders Petrie]] excavated the area and found considerable signs of military activity.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Palace of Apries (Memphis II)'', § II, p. 5–7 &amp; plates III to IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other buildings===
The centrally located palaces and temples were surrounded by different districts of the city, in which were many craftsmen's workshops, arsenals, and dockyards. Also were residential neighbourhoods, some of which were inhabited primarily by foreigners—first [[Hittites]] and [[Phoenicians]], later [[Persian people|Persians]], and finally [[Greek people|Greek]]. The city was indeed located at the crossroads of trade routes and thus attracted goods imported from diverse regions of the Mediterranean.

Ancient texts confirm that citywide development took place regularly. Furthermore, there is evidence that the [[Nile]] has shifted over the centuries to the east, leaving new lands to occupy in the eastern part of the old capital.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, D.G.; Smith, H.S (1988). ''The eastward shift of the Nile's course through history at Memphis'', p. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This area of the city was dominated by the large eastern gate of the temple of Ptah.

==Historical accounts and exploration==
The site of Memphis has been famous since ancient times, and is cited in many ancient sources, including both Egyptian and foreign. Diplomatic records found on different sites have detailed the correspondence between the city and the various contemporary empires in the Mediterranean, Near East, and Africa. These include for example the [[Amarna letters]], which detail trade conducted between Memphis and the sovereigns of [[Babylon]] and the various city-states of [[History of ancient Lebanon|Lebanon]]. The proclamations of the later Assyrian kings cite Memphis among its list of conquests.

===Sources from antiquity===
Beginning with the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, the city was detailed more and more intensely in the words of ancient historians, especially with the development of trade ties with Greece. The descriptions of the city by travellers who followed the traders in the discovery of Egypt have proved instrumental in reconstructing an image of the ancient capital's glorious past. Among the main classical authors are:
* [[Herodotus]], Greek historian, who visited and described the monuments of the city during the first [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Achaemenid]] rule in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' (Vol II), paragraphs 99, 101, 108, 110, 112, 121, 136, 153 and 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diodorus Siculus]], Greek historian, who visited the site in the 1st century BCE, providing later information about the city during the reign of the Ptolemies.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, ''Bibliotheca historica'' (Vol I), Ch. I, paragraphs 12, 15 and 24; Ch. II, paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 20 and 32.f&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Strabo]], the [[Hellenistic]] geographer, who visited during the Roman conquest in the late 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geographica'', Book XVII, chapters 31 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, the city is often cited by other Latin or Greek authors, in rare cases providing an overall description of the city or detailing its cults, as do [[Suetonius]]&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Part XI: Life of Titus.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Roman History'', Book XXII, § XIV.&lt;/ref&gt; who pay particular attention to the city's worship of Apis. The city was plunged into oblivion during the Christian period that followed, and few sources are available to attest to the city's activities during its final stages.

It was not until the conquest of the country by the Arabs that a description of the city reappears, by which time it was already in ruins. Among the major sources from this time:
* [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-al-Latif]], a famous geographer of Baghdad, which in the 13th century gives a description of the ruins of the site during his trip to Egypt.
* [[Al-Maqrizi]], Egyptian historian in the 14th century, who visited the site and describes it in detail.

===Early exploration===
[[Image:MemphisJamesRennell01.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Memphis, Egypt in 1799.|[[James Rennell]]'s map of Memphis and [[Cairo]] in 1799, showing the changes in the course of the [[Nile]] river.]]
In 1652, [[Jean de Thévenot]], during his trip to Egypt, identified the location of the site and its ruins, confirming the accounts of the old Arab authors for Europe. His description is brief, but represents the first step towards the exploration that will emerge after the development of archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Thévenot, ''Relation d’un voyage fait au Levant'', Book II, Ch. IV, p. 403; and Ch. VI, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; The starting point of archaeological exploration in Memphis was [[Napoléon Bonaparte]]'s great [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|foray into Egypt]] in 1798. Research and surveys of the site confirmed the identification of Thévenot, and the first studies of its remains are carried out by scientists accompanying French soldiers. The results of the first scientific studies were published in the monumental ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', a map of the region, the first to give the location of Memphis with precision.

===Nineteenth century===
The early French expeditions paved the way for explorations of a deeper scope that would follow from the 19th century until today, conducted by leading explorers, Egyptologists and major archaeological institutions. Here is a partial list:
* The first excavations of the site were made by Caviglia and Sloane in 1820. They discovered the great colossus of Rameses II lying, currently on display in the museum.
* [[Jean-François Champollion]], in his trip to Egypt from 1828 to 1830 through Memphis, described the giant discovered by Caviglia and Sloane, made a few digs at the site and decrypted many of the epigraphic remains. He promised to return with more resources and more time to study, but his sudden death in 1832 meant he did not achieve this ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Champollion-Figeac, ''l'Égypte Ancienne'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karl Richard Lepsius]], during the Prussian expedition of 1842, made a quick survey of the ruins and created a first detailed map that would serve as the basis for all future explorations and excavations.&lt;ref&gt;Lepsius, ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien'', booklets of 14 February, 19 February, 19 March and 18 May 1843, p. 202–204; and plates 9 and 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[British Egypt|British era]] in Egypt, the development of agricultural technology along with the systematic cultivation of the Nile floodplains led to a considerable amount of accidental archaeological discoveries. Much of what was found would fall into the hands of major European collectors travelling the country on behalf of the great museums of [[List of museums in London|London]], [[List of museums in Paris|Paris]], [[List of museums and galleries in Berlin|Berlin]], and [[Museo Egizio|Turin]]. It was during one of these land cultivations that peasants discovered, accidentally in 1847 near the village of Mit Rahina, elements of a Roman temple of [[Mithras]]. It was probably at this location where eleven statues were found. A review of ''Les Statues Ptolémaïques du Sarapieion de Memphis'' noted they were probably build in the 3rd Century with limestone and stucco, some standing others sitting. Rowe and Rees 1956 suggested that the theme was similar to Plato's Academy mosaic. Statues were attributed to, [[Pindar]] (seated, identified per a graffiti), a inscription at the back of his chair reads Dionysi, [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], Orphic, aux oiseaux, Hesiode, [[Homer]] seated in the center (head was recovered), [[Protagoras]], [[Thales]], [[Heraclite]], [[Plato|Platon]] (per inscription), and [[Aristote]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RoweRees1956&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1914&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF|authors=Alan Rowe and B.

Lauer and Ch. Picard|year=1957|doi=10.2307/500375|journal=Archaeological Institute of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1852 to 1854, Joseph Hekekyan, then working for the Egyptian government, conducted geological surveys on the site, and on these occasions made a number of discoveries, such as those at Kom el-Khanzir (northeast of the great temple of Ptah). These stones decorated with reliefs from the Amarna period, originally from the ancient temple of Aten in Memphis, had almost certainly been reused in the foundations of another ruined monument. He also discovered the great [[Statue of Ramesses II (Mit Rahina)|colossus of Rameses II]] in pink granite.

This spate of archaeological discoveries gave birth to the constant risk of seeing all these cultural riches finally leave Egyptian soil. [[Auguste-Édouard Mariette]], who visited Saqqara in 1850, became aware of the need to create an institution in Egypt responsible for the exploration and conservation of the country's archaeological treasures. He established the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Egyptian Antiquities Organisation]] (EAO) in 1859, and organised excavations at Memphis which revealed the first evidence of the great temple of Ptah, and uncovered the royal statues of the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Mariette, ''Monuments divers collected in Egypt and in Nubia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest published papyri [[Greek Magical Papyri]], may have originated from the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Dieter Betz|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|year=1992|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
The major excavations of the British Egyptologist Sir [[Flinders Petrie|William Matthew Flinders Petrie]], conducted from 1907 to 1912, uncovered the majority of the ruins as seen today. Major discoveries on the site during these excavations included the pillared hall of the temple of Ptah, the pylon of Rameses II, the great alabaster sphinx, and the great wall north of the palace of Apries. He also discovered the remains of the Temple of Amun of Siamon, and the Temple of Ptah of Merneptah.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''Memphis I'' and ''Memphis II''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work was interrupted during the First World War, and would later be taken up by other archaeologists, gradually uncovering some of the forgotten monuments of the ancient capital.

A timeline listing the main findings:
* 1914 to 1921: the excavations of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] of the Temple of Ptah of Merneptah, which yield the discovery of the adjoining palace.
* 1942: the EAO survey, led by Egyptologist Ahmed Badawy, discovers the small Temple of Ptah of Rameses, and the chapel of the tomb of prince Shoshenq of the 22nd dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Badawy, ''Grab des Kronprinzen Scheschonk, Sohnes Osorkon's II, und Hohenpriesters von Memphis'', p. 153–177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1950: Egyptologist [[Labib Habachi]] discovers the chapel of Seti I, on behalf of the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation. The Egyptian government decides to transfer the pink granite colossus of Rameses II to Cairo. It is placed before the city's main train station, in a square subsequently named ''Midân Rameses''.
* 1954: the chance discovery by roadworkers of a necropolis of the Middle Kingdom at Kom el-Fakhri.&lt;ref&gt;El-Hitta, ''Excavations at Memphis of Kom el-Fakhri''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1955 to 1957: Rudolph Anthes, on behalf of the University of Philadelphia, searches and clears the small Temple of Ptah of Rameses, and the embalming chapel of Apis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthes, works from 1956, 1957 and 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: the accidental discovery of a chapel of the small Temple of Hathor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* 1970 to 1984: excavations conducted by the EAO clear the small temple of Hathor; directed by Abdullah el-Sayed Mahmud, Huleil Ghali and Karim Abu Shanab.
* 1980: excavations of the embalming chamber of Apis, and further studies by the [[American Research Center in Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The temple of Apis in Memphis''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1982: Egyptologist Jaromir Málek studies and records the findings of the small temple of Ptah of Rameses.&lt;ref&gt;Málek, ''A Temple with a Noble Pylon'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970, and 1984 to 1990: excavations by the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] in London. Further excavations of the pillared hall and pylon of Rameses II; the discovery of granite blocks bearing the annals of the reign of [[Amenemhat II]]; excavations of the tombs of high priests of Ptah; research and major explorations at the necropolis near Saqqara.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, ''The survey of Memphis'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003: renewed excavations of the small temple of Hathor by the EAO (now the Supreme Council of Antiquities).
* 2003 to 2004: Excavations by a combined Russian-Belgian mission in the great wall north of Memphis.

'''Harageh''' (also '''el-Harageh''' or '''Haraga''') is a modern village in Egypt at the entrance to the river oasis of the [[Fayum]], close to [[El-Lahun]]. In archaeology Harageh is mainly known for a series of cemeteries dating to several periods of Egyptian history. [[Reginald Engelbach]] excavated these cemeteries in 1913. The cemeteries belong to the [[Naqada]]-Period, to the [[First Intermediate Period]], to the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and to the [[New Kingdom]]; a few Coptic stelae were discovered here as well. Especially the burials of the late Middle Kingdom belonged to wealthy people. Perhaps the people of [[El-Lahun]] were buried here. Engelbach found stelae including the only one known to be dedicated to the god [[Hedjhotep]], inscribed coffins, canopic boxes and jars, and many statues.

'''Tahpanhes''' (also transliterated '''Tahapanes''' or '''Tehaphnehes'''; known by the Ancient Greeks as the ([[Pelusium|Pelusian]]) '''Daphnae''' ({{lang-grc|Δάφναι αἱ Πηλούσιαι}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus|title=Histories|chapter=II.30,107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Taphnas''' ({{lang|grc|Ταφνας}}) in the [[Septuagint]], now '''Tell Defenneh''') was a city in [[Ancient Egypt]]. It was located on [[Lake Manzala]] on the Tanitic branch of the [[Nile]], about 26&amp;nbsp;km (16 miles) from [[Pelusium]]. The site is now situated on the [[Suez Canal]].

==History==
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Jews from [[Jerusalem]] fled to this place after the death of [[Gedaliah]] and settled there for a time ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|2:16|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|43:7,8,9|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|44:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|46:14|HE}}; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|30:18|HE}}). Its Hebrew name is {{lang-he|תַּחְפַּנְחֵס}} (''Taḥpanḥēs'').

A platform of [[brickwork]], which has been tentatively described as the pavement at the entry of [[Pharaoh]]'s palace, has been discovered at this place. &quot;Here,&quot; says the discoverer, [[William Flinders Petrie]], &quot;the ceremony described by Jeremiah {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|43:8-10|HE}}; 'brick-kiln' (i.e. pavement of brick) took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] spread his royal pavilion&quot;.{{sfn|Petrie|1888}}

[[Psammetichus I|King Psammetichus]] (664–610 BC) established a garrison of foreign mercenaries at Daphnae, mostly [[Caria]]ns and [[Ionia]]n Greeks ([[Herodotus]] ii. 154).

After Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 BC, the Jewish refugees, including [[Jeremiah]], came to Tahpanhes (Jeremiah Chapters 43-44).

When [[Naucratis]] was given the monopoly of Greek traffic by [[Amasis II]] (570–526 BC), the Greeks were removed from Daphnae and its prosperity never returned; in Herodotus' time the deserted remains of the docks and buildings were visible.

The site was discovered by [[Flinders Petrie|Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie]] in 1886; it was then known by natives as Qasr Bint al-Yahudi, the &quot;Castle of the Jew's Daughter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gcoCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22castle+of+the+jew%27s+daughter%22&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=%22castle%20of%20the%20jew%27s%20daughter%22&amp;f=false Volume 14], ''[[The Antiquary (magazine)|The Antiquary]]'', 1886&lt;/ref&gt; There is a massive fort and enclosure; the chief discovery was a large number of fragments of pottery, which are of great importance for the chronology of vase-painting, since they must belong to the time between Psammetichus and Amasis, i.e. the end of the 7th or the beginning of the 6th century BC. They show the characteristics of Ionian art, but their shapes and other details testify to their local manufacture.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Daphnae |volume=7 |page=825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Luxor'' comes from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ʾuqṣur}}'' ({{lang|ar|الأقصر}}), ''lit.'' &quot;the palaces&quot;, from the collective plural of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qaṣr}}'' ({{lang|ar|قصر}}),&lt;ref&gt;Verner, Miroslav (2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Khh0BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=luxor+plural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lm9A7c1qat&amp;sig=aNfkF-6RJGuE1cWkAv9AySDpbSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKjWt6DMAhWBMyYKHTn4AlYQ6AEINzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=plural&amp;f=false Temple of the World: Sanctuaries, Cults, and Mysteries of Ancient Egypt] Cairo: American University in Cairo Press. p. 232. {{ISBN|9789774165634}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be a loanword from the [[Latin]] ''castrum'' &quot;fortified camp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, Irfan (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pfwAG3-rpzcC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=qasr+castrum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Imoo1ofWaf&amp;sig=EDhOsgv0v-Ji5IVJtaJeHbrjLHU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4-HpoKDMAhWFKCYKHbTpDXUQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=qasr%20castrum&amp;f=false Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century] Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection. {{ISBN|9780884022848}}. page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luxor Temple]]]]

Luxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the great capital of (Upper) Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the glorious city of Amun, later to become the god [[Amun-Ra]]. The city was regarded in the Ancient Egyptian texts as ''w3s.t'' (approximate pronunciation: &quot;Waset&quot;), which meant &lt;!--&quot;the foremost&quot; or // commented this out, since I never heard this etymology -- word is not even close to &quot;xnti&quot; meaning &quot;foremost&quot;, and I looked it up in dictionary, the only word close to ws.t is ws, meaning sceptre --&gt; &quot;city of the sceptre&quot; and also as ''t3 ip3t'' (conventionally pronounced as &quot;ta ipet&quot; and meaning &quot;the shrine&quot;) and then, in a later period, the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] called it Thebai and the Romans after them Thebae. Thebes was also known as &quot;the city of the 100 gates&quot;, sometimes being called &quot;southern Heliopolis&quot; ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of [[Iunu]] or [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as ''niw.t,'' which simply means &quot;city&quot;, and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and Heliopolis); it was also called ''niw.t rst,'' &quot;southern city&quot;, as the southernmost of them. 

The importance of the city started as early as the [[11th Dynasty]], when the town grew into a thriving city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/egypt/luxor-history.htm|title=History of Luxor (Thebes)|publisher=Sacred Destinations|accessdate=December 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013003321/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/egypt/luxor-history.htm|archivedate=October 13, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montuhotep II]] who united Egypt after the troubles of the first intermediate period brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], in today's northern [[Sudan]], and to the lands of [[Canaan]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria]] saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the [[Hyksos]] from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the [[18th Dynasty]] to the [[20th Dynasty]], the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.

The city attracted peoples such as the [[Babylonians]], the [[Mitanni]], the [[Hittites of Anatolia]] (modern-day Turkey), the [[Canaanites]] of Ugarit, the [[Phoenicians]] of [[Byblos]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the [[Minoans]] from the island of [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ankhesenamun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally [[Alexandria]].

However, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amon rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amon-Ra. His great temple, at [[Karnak]] just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.

Later, the city was attacked by [[Assyria]]n emperor [[Assurbanipal]] who installed the [[Libya]]n prince on the throne, [[Psamtik I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, [[Alexander the Great]] did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt; Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks in the [[Roman Empire]] who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of [[Hatshepsut]], now called [[Deir el-Bahri]] (&quot;the northern monastery&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacred&quot;/&gt;

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Luxor has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] BWh) like the rest of Egypt. [[Aswan]] and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any other city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above {{convert|40|°C|0}} during summer (June, July, August)  During the coldest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above {{convert|71.6|F|0|order=flip}} while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|5|°C|0}}.

The climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the [[Sahara]], with less than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than Aswan but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.

The climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close of the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.

In addition, Luxor, [[Minya, Egypt#Climate|Minya]], [[Sohag#Climate|Sohag]], [[Qena#Climate|Qena]] and [[Asyut#Climate|Asyut]] have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]], with almost {{convert|16|C-change}} difference.

The hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991 which was {{convert|50|°C}} and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989  which was {{convert|-1|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voodoo Skies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/luxor | title=Luxor, Egypt | accessdate =21 June 2013 | publisher =Voodoo Skies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coptic Catholic Eparchy ==
{{prose|date=March 2017}}
The Coptic Catholic ([[Alexandrian Rite]]) minority established on November 26, 1895 an Eparchy ([[Eastern Catholic]] Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt]]. Its episcopal see is a St. George [[cathedral]] in Luxor.
 
In turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947 to establish the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Assiut|Eparchy of Assiut]] and again on 1981.09.13: Lost territory to establish [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Sohag|Sohag]].

== Economy ==

[[File:Luxor Souq R01.jpg|thumb|Luxor [[souq]]]]

The economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent upon tourism. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly [[sugarcane]],There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry used in eating and many other uses.

The local economy was hit by the [[Luxor massacre]] in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks|Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm Shock in Sharm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924125054/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm |date=2013-09-24 }} 23 July, Serene Assir, Al-Ahram Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Solidly ahead of oil, Suez Canal revenues, and remittances, tourism is Egypt's main hard currency earner at $6.5 billion per year.&quot; (in 2005) [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/741/eg1.htm ... concerns over tourism's future ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924131816/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/741/eg1.htm |date=2013-09-24 }} accessed 27 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets.

To make up for shortfalls of income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.

== Tourism development ==

[[File:Winter Palace Luxor front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sofitel Winter Palace Hotel|Winter Palace Hotel]]]]

A controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into a vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre.  The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the {{convert|2.7|km|1|abbr=off}} long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and took its final form under [[Nectanebo I]] in 400 BCE.  Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated which was covered by silt, homes, mosques and churches.  Excavation started around 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGrath |first=Cam |url=http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/16/10131 |title=Mideast: Sphinx Avenue Paved With Bitter Memories — Global Issues |publisher=Globalissues.org |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGrath |first=Cam |url=http://elagazat.com/ar/iberotel-luxor-hotel |title=Mideast: Sphinx Avenue Paved With Bitter Memories — Global Issues |publisher=Globalissues.org |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 hot air balloon crash===
{{main|2013 Luxor hot air balloon crash}}
Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013 near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt and likely to push the tourism industry deeper into recession. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals and nine tourists from Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;(Times of India, Indore, MP, India edition Wed, Feb. 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
===Transport===
Luxor is served by [[Luxor International Airport]].
[[File:Luxor International.JPG|thumb|Luxor International Airport]]
A bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank.
Traditionally, however, river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor. The single fare (June 2008) is 1 L.E. - one Egyptian Pound - per passenger for foreigners. Egyptian nationals pay ¼ of that, 25 piasters. This ferry is mainly used by the locals although a number of foreigners do use it.
[[File:Luxor Station.jpg|thumb|left|Luxor railway station]]
Transport to sites on the west bank are serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 25 piasters, although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day providing a quicker, but more expensive (5 L.E.), crossing to the other side.

The city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called &quot;calèches,&quot; for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful, and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.

For domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around {{convert|400|m|yd}} from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and [[Aswan]] to the south.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">'''Sedment''' is the name of a village in Egypt. In [[Egyptology]] it is mainly known for a series of cemeteries excavated near this village. The cemeteries were the target of several expeditions, the most substantial one under [[Flinders Petrie]] and [[Guy Brunton]]. Their work was published in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Flinders Petrie/Guy Brunton: ''Sedment I + II''. London 1924&lt;/ref&gt; They found several hundred burials dating from around 3000 BC to the [[New Kingdom]]. Especially many burials were found dating to the [[First Intermediate Period]] and New Kingdom. The First Intermediate Period burials contained several inscribed coffins, but also many burials with wooden models. The New Kingdom burials were found much looted, but some reliefs found demonstrate that several tombs were adorned with a relief–decorated chapel above ground. The largest tomb was that of the [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] [[Prehotep II (Vizier)|Prehotep]] who was in office under king [[Ramses II]].

The '''Giza pyramid complex''' ({{lang-ar|أهرامات الجيزة}}, {{IPA-arz|ʔɑhɾɑˈmɑːt elˈɡiːzæ|IPA}}, &quot;[[pyramid]]s of Giza&quot;) is an [[archaeological site]] on the [[Giza Plateau]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. 

This complex of ancient monuments includes the three [[pyramid]] complexes known as the '''Great Pyramids''', the massive [[sculpture]] known as the [[Great Sphinx]], several cemeteries, a workers' village and an industrial complex. It is located in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]], approximately 9&amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the [[Nile|Nile river]] at the old town of [[Giza]], and about 13&amp;nbsp;km (8&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Cairo city centre. 

The pyramids, which have historically been common as emblems of [[ancient Egypt in the Western imagination]],&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medieval visitors, like the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] in 1436, viewed them however as &quot;the Granaries of Joseph&quot; (Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch5 Andanças e viajes]'').&lt;/ref&gt; were popularised in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] times, when the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] was listed by [[Antipater of Sidon]] as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]]. It is by far the oldest of the ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.

The Pyramids of Giza consist of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or [[Khufu]] and constructed c. 2560–2540 BC), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Chephren) a few hundred meters to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or&amp;nbsp;Mykerinos) a few hundred meters farther south-west. The [[Great Sphinx]] lies on the east side of the complex. Current consensus among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of [[Khafre]]. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as &quot;queens&quot; pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;&gt;Verner, Miroslav.

One of these ships has been restored and is on display.
Khufu's pyramid still has a limited collection of casing stones at its base. These casing stones were made of fine white limestone quarried from the nearby range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

===Khafre's pyramid complex===
{{main| Pyramid of Khafre| Great Sphinx of Giza }}
Khafre’s pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, the Sphinx temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple and the king’s pyramid. The valley temple yielded several statues of Khafre. Several were found in a well in the floor of the temple by Mariette in 1860. Others were found during successive excavations by Sieglin (1909–10), Junker, Reisner, and Hassan. Khafre’s complex contained five boat-pits and a subsidiary pyramid with a [[serdab]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19–26}}
Khafre's pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre's pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

===Menkaure's pyramid complex===
{{main|Pyramid of Menkaure}}
Menkaure’s pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king’s pyramid. The valley temple once contained several statues of [[Menkaure]]. During the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th dynasty]], a smaller ante-temple was added on to the valley temple. The mortuary temple also yielded several statues of [[Menkaure]]. The king’s pyramid has three subsidiary or queen’s pyramids.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|26–35}}
Of the four major monuments, only Menkaure's pyramid is seen today without any of its original polished [[limestone]] casing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

===Sphinx===

===Tomb of Queen Khentkaus I===
{{main|Khentkaus I}}
[[Khentkaus I]] was buried in Giza. Her tomb is known as LG 100 and G 8400 and is located in the Central Field, near the valley temple of [[Menkaure]]. The pyramid complex of Queen Khentkaus includes: her pyramid, a boat pit, a valley temple and a pyramid town.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|288–289}}

==Construction==
{{Main|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}

Most construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. The disagreements center on the method by which the stones were conveyed and placed and how possible the method was.

In building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time. They would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock—not sand—which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.

For the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the [[Nile]]. These exterior blocks had to be carefully cut, transported by river barge to Giza, and dragged up ramps to the construction site. Only a few exterior blocks remain in place at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. During the Middle Ages (5th century to 15th century), people may have taken the rest away for building projects in the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

To ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded as time has passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

===Purpose===
The pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased [[Pharaoh]]s who ruled over [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt; A portion of the Pharaoh's spirit called his ''ka'' was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the &quot;former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead.&quot;. It's theorized the pyramid not only served as a tomb for the Pharaoh, but also as a storage pit for various items he would need in the afterlife. &quot;The people of Ancient Egypt believed that death on Earth was the start of a journey to the next world. The embalmed body of the King was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturefocus.com/egypt_pyramids.htm |title=Egypt pyramids |author= |work= |publisher=culturefocus.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102205240/http://culturefocus.com/egypt_pyramids.htm |archivedate=2 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers' village==
[[File:S10.08 Gizeh, image 9936.jpg|thumbnail|One face of the [[Pyramid of Khafre]] in Giza, showing a nearby archaeological site]]
The work of quarrying, moving, setting, and sculpting the huge amount of stone used to build the pyramids might have been accomplished by several thousand skilled workers, unskilled laborers and supporting workers. Bakers, carpenters, water carriers, and others were also needed for the project. Along with the methods utilized to construct the pyramids, there is also wide speculation regarding the exact number of workers needed for a building project of this magnitude. When Greek historian [[Herodotus]] visited Giza in 450&amp;nbsp;BC, he was told by Egyptian priests that &quot;the Great Pyramid had taken 400,000 men 20 years to build, working in three-month shifts 100,000 men at a time.&quot; Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verner&quot;/&gt;

The Giza pyramid complex is surrounded by a large stone wall, outside which [[Mark Lehner]] and his team discovered a town where the pyramid workers were housed. The village is located to the southeast of the [[Khafre]] and [[Menkaure]] complexes. Among the discoveries at the workers' village are communal sleeping quarters, bakeries, breweries, and kitchens (with evidence showing that bread, beef, and fish were staples of the diet), a hospital and a cemetery (where some of the skeletons were found with signs of trauma associated with accidents on a building site).&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;I. E. S. Edwards ''The Pyramids of Egypt'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The workers' town appears to date from the middle [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] (2520–2472&amp;nbsp;BC), after the accepted time of Khufu and completion of the Great Pyramid. According to Lehner and the AERA team;
: &quot;The development of this urban complex must have been quite rapid. All of the construction probably happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure, builders of the Second and Third Giza Pyramids&quot;.
Without carbon dating, using only pottery shards, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to date the site, the team further concludes;
: &quot;The picture that emerges is that of a planned settlement, some of the world's earliest urban planning, securely dated to the reigns of two Giza pyramid builders: Khafre (2520–2494&amp;nbsp;BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472&amp;nbsp;BC)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/projects/lost-city/|title=Egyptian Pyramids - Lost City of the Pyramid Builders - AERA - Ancient Egypt Research Associates|work=aeraweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeraweb.org/lost-city-project/dating-the-lost-city/|title=Dating the Lost City of the Pyramids - Mark Lehner &amp; AERA - Ancient Egypt Research Associates|work=aeraweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cemeteries==
[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|thumb|300px|Giza pyramid complex (map)]]
[[File:Giza-pyramids.JPG|thumb|300px|Giza pyramid complex seen from above]]
As the pyramids were constructed, the [[mastaba]]s for lesser royals were constructed around them. Near the pyramid of Khufu, the main cemetery is G 7000 which lies in the East Field located to the east of the main pyramid and next to the Queen’s pyramids. These cemeteries around the pyramids were arranged along streets and avenues.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Dr. Mark, &quot;''The Complete Pyramids''&quot;, [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1997. {{ISBN|0-500-05084-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cemetery G 7000 was one of the earliest and contained tombs of wives, sons and daughters of these [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] rulers. On the other side of the pyramid in the West Field, the royals sons [[Wepemnofret]] and [[Hemiunu]] were buried in Cemetery G 1200 and Cemetery G 4000 respectively. These cemeteries were further expanded during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th]] and [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;

===West Field===
{{main| Giza West Field}}
The West Field is located to the west of [[Khufu]]’s pyramid. It is divided into smaller areas such as the cemeteries referred to as the Abu Bakr Excavations (1949–50, 1950–1,1952 and 1953), and several cemeteries named based on the [[mastaba]] numbers such as Cemetery G 1000, Cemetery G 1100, etc. The West Field contains Cemetery G1000 – Cemetery G1600, and Cemetery G 1900. Further cemeteries in this field are: Cemeteries G 2000, G 2200, G 2500, G 3000, G 4000, and G 6000. Three other cemeteries are named after their excavators: Junker Cemetery West, Junker Cemetery East and Steindorff Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|100–122}}

===Tombs of the pyramid builders===
In 1990, tombs belonging to the pyramid workers were discovered alongside the pyramids with an additional burial site found nearby in 2009. Although not mummified, they had been buried in mud-brick tombs with beer and bread to support them in the afterlife. The tombs' proximity to the pyramids and the manner of burial supports the theory that they were paid laborers who took great pride in their work and were not slaves, as was previously thought. The commonly held belief of slaves building the pyramids was likely to have been popularized by Hollywood films based on the original archaeological and anthropological opinion that they could not have been built without forced labor. Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid. Most of the workers appear to have come from poor families. Farms supplied the laborers with 21 cattle and 23 sheep daily. Specialists such as architects, masons, metalworkers and carpenters, were permanently employed by the king to fill positions that required the most skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/pyramids.html#tombs |title=Who Built the Pyramids? |author= |work=Explore the pyramids |publisher= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/07/who-built-the-pyramids |title=Who built the pyramids? |author= |date = July 2003|work= |publisher=Harvard Alumni Magazine |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt: New find shows slaves didn't build pyramids |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=11 January 2010 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100111/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_egypt_antiquities |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114054218/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100111/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_egypt_antiquities |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://guardians.net/hawass/buildtomb.htm The Discovery of the Tombs of the Pyramid Builders at Giza] by Zahi Hawass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/events/cemetery-pyramid-builders The Cemetery of the Pyramid Builders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915172639/http://www.drhawass.com/events/cemetery-pyramid-builders |date=15 September 2010 }} by Zahi Hawass&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Kingdom==
During the [[New Kingdom]], Giza was still an active site. A brick-built chapel was constructed near the Sphinx during the early [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], probably by King [[Thutmose I]]. [[Amenhotep II]] built a temple dedicated to Hauron-Haremakhet near the Sphinx. Pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] visited the pyramids and the Sphinx as a prince and in a dream was told that clearing the sand from the Sphinx would be rewarded with kingship. This event is recorded in the Dream stela. During the early years of his reign, Thutmose IV together with his wife Queen Nefertari had stelae erected at Giza. Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] had a structure built, which is now referred to as the king's resthouse.
During the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], [[Seti I]] added to the temple of Hauron-Haremakhet, and his son [[Ramesses II]] erected a stela in the chapel before the Sphinx and usurped the resthouse of Tutankhamun.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|39–47}}

==Late Period==
During the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]], the Temple of Isis Mistress-of-the-Pyramids was reconstructed. During the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]], a stela made in this time mentions Khufu and his Queen [[Henutsen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">The '''Wadi el-Hudi''' is a [[wadi]] in Southern [[Egypt]], in the Eastern Desert. Here were ancient quarries for [[amethyst]]. The Wadi el-Hudi is important in archaeology for its high number of rock inscriptions and stelae, mainly dating to the Middle Kingdom, as amethyst was especially popular in this period. The Wadi el-Hudi ends in the Nile valley a few kilometers north of [[Aswan]] and is coming there from the South-East. The ancient amethyst quarries are about 20 kilometres south-east from Aswan.&lt;ref&gt;Ashraf I. Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi: The amethyst mining Inscriptions I, Text'', Warminster 1980, {{ISBN|0-85668-162-8}}, p. 1, map 1, on p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest datable inscriptions in the Wadi el-Hudi belong to king [[Mentuhotep IV]] who reigned around 2000 BC. in the 11th Dynasty. These are five texts dated to the first year of the king and clearly report the aim of the expedition as bringing amethyst.&lt;ref&gt;Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi'', pp. 4-15&lt;/ref&gt; Further inscriptions date to the 12th Dynasty under king [[Senusret I]]. One of them mentions the vizier [[Intefiqer]], another one the high steward Hor.&lt;ref&gt;Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi'', pp. 16-36, 84-92&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th Dynasty kings [[Amenemhat II]], [[Senusret III]] and [[Amenemhat III]] are also attested with expeditions and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi'', pp. 37-43, 93-97&lt;/ref&gt; The last 12th Dynasty king sending an expedition to the Wadi was [[Amenemhat IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi'', pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there are several texts providing evidence for an expedition under the 13th Dynasty king [[Sobekhotep IV]]. His expedition is dated to the sixth year of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Sadek: ''Wadi el-Hudi'', pp. 46-52&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hathor]], who is called ''lady of amethyst'', appears often in the inscriptions.

Further mining activities, including gold mining,  are known from other periods of Egypptian history, up to the Roman Period.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw: ''Late Roman Amethyst and  old Mining at Wadi el-Hudi'', in: Thomas Schneider and Kasia Szpakowska (eds.) ''Egyptian Stories A British Egyptological Tribute to Alan B. Lloyd on the Occasion of His Retirement'', Alter Orient und Altes Testament 347, 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-934628-94-6}}, 141-150&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological and epigraphic work at Wadi el-Hudi was continued in 2014 by the Wadi el-Hudi Expedition.  The project is directed by Dr. Kate Liszka with Princeton University and California State University, San Bernardino.

'''Aniba''' was a village in [[Nubia]], about 230 km south of [[Aswan]]. The place is today flooded by the [[Lake Nasser]]. In ancient times it was an important town and called '''''Miam'''''. The region around the town was one of the most fertile in [[Lower Nubia]].&lt;ref&gt;Torgny Säve-Söderbergh: ''Aniba'', in: [[Wolfgang Helck]], Eberhard Otto (editors), ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie'', I. Wiesbaden 1975, {{ISBN|3447016701}}, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest remains at Aniba date around 3000 BC and belong to the [[A-Group Culture]]. A few cemeteries belonging to them were found. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (about 2000 to 1700 BC) the region was ruled by Egyptians and in the [[Twelfth Dynasty]] there was built a fortress with a small town. At the beginning of the [[New Kingdom]] (about 1550 BC) the town was extended and was about 200 x 400 m big, with a wall and gates. During the New Kingdom the town grew and had several suburbs. Within the town proper stood the temple for ''[[Horus]] of Miam''. When excavated it was only badly preserved but might be a foundation of the Middle Kingdom. North of the town there still stood a Nubian village belonging to the [[C-Group Culture]]. Around the town were huge cemeteries, some of them belonging to Nubians, but other tombs were erected in purely Egyptian style. It is not known for sure whether the people buried here were Nubians that adopted Egyptian culture or whether these were Egyptians. One rather simple tomb belonged to the ''[[viceroy of Kush]]'' [[Pinehesy]], an important person also known from other sources. There is even a decorated rock cut tomb belonging to the ''deputy of Lower Nubia'' Penenut. The latter office had most likely its headquarter in Aniba.&lt;ref&gt;Torgny Säve-Söderbergh: ''Aniba'', in: [[Wolfgang Helck]], Eberhard Otto (editors), ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie'', I. Wiesbaden 1975, {{ISBN|3447016701}}, p. 272-278&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thebes''' ({{lang-grc|Θῆβαι}}, ''Thēbai''), known to the [[ancient Egypt]]ians as '''Waset''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[list of ancient Egyptian sites|city]] located east of the [[Nile]] about {{convert|800|km|sp=us}} south of the [[Mediterranean]]. Its ruins lie within the modern [[Egypt]]ian [[list of Egyptian cities|city]] of [[Luxor]]. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt mainly during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. It was close to [[Nubia]] and the [[Eastern Desert]], with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a [[Theban Triad|cult center]] and the most venerated city of ancient Egypt during its heyday. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of [[Karnak]] and [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] stand and the city proper was situated; and the western bank, where a [[Theban Necropolis|necropolis]] of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found.

The [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]s originally knew Thebes as '''Wo'se''' or '''Wase'''.  A ''[[was (sceptre)|was]]'' was the [[scepter]] of the [[pharaoh]]s, a long staff with an animal's head and a forked base. From the end of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], Thebes was known in Egyptian as {{nowrap|'''Niwt-'Imn'''}}, the &quot;City of Amun&quot;. [[Amun]] was the chief of the [[Theban Triad]] of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]] whose other members were [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]]. This name of Thebes appears in the [[Bible]] as the {{nowrap|&quot;Nōʼ ʼĀmôn&quot;}} ({{lang|he|נא אמון}}) of the [[Book of Nahum]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nahum 3:8]].&lt;/ref&gt; and also as the &quot;No&quot; ({{lang|he|נא}}) mentioned in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 30:14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 46:25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huddlestun, John R. “Nahum, Nineveh, and the Nile: The Description of Thebes in Nahum 3:8–9.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 62, no. 2, 2003, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thebes is the [[latinization of names|Latinized]] form of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Thebai'', the [[Hellenization|hellenized]] form of the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] {{nowrap|''Ta-pe''}}, from earlier ''Ta Opet''. This was the local name not for the city itself but for the [[Karnak]] temple complex on the northern east bank of the city. As early as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', IV.406 and IX.383.&lt;/ref&gt; the Greeks distinguished the Egyptian Thebes as {{nowrap|'''Thebes of the Hundred Gates'''}} ({{lang|grc|Θῆβαι ἑκατόμπυλοι}}, ''Thēbai hekatómpyloi'') or '''Hundred-Gated Thebes''', as opposed to the &quot;[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes of the Seven Gates]]&quot; ({{lang|grc|Θῆβαι ἑπτάπυλοι}}, ''Thēbai heptapyloi'') in [[Boeotia]], [[Greece]].{{refn|group=n|[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] records that owing to its &quot;connection&quot; with the Egyptian city, the Boeotian Thebes also had an idol and temple of [[Amun]] from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'', IX.16 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', Amun was rendered as [[Zeus Ammon]]. The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis, &quot;City of Zeus&quot;. To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name, it was known as the {{nowrap|'''Great Diospolis'''}} ({{lang|grc|Διόσπολις Μεγάλη}}, ''Dióspolis Megálē''; {{lang-la|Diospolis Magna}}). The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]], when the country came to be ruled by the [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

==Characteristics==
===Geography===
Thebes was located along the banks of the [[Nile River|Nile]] River in the middle part of [[Upper Egypt]] about 800&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. It was built largely on the [[alluvial plains]] of the [[Nile Valley]] which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence, the city was laid in a northeast-southwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of 93&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (36 sq mi) which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred 420-meter (1,378-foot) [[al-Qurn]]. In the east lies the mountainous [[Eastern Desert]] with its [[wadi]]s draining into the valley. Significant of these wadis is [[Wadi Hammamat]] near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the [[Red Sea]] coast.

In the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]], Thebes was found to have neighboring towns such as [[Gebelein|Per-Hathor]], [[Medamud|Madu]], [[El-Tod|Djerty]], [[Hermonthis|Iuny]], [[Sumenu|Sumenu and Imiotru]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, T. (2013). &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt&quot;. Erenow. Retrieved 2016-02-25, from http://www.erenow.com/ancient/theriseandfallofancientegypt/8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
[[File:Thebes historical population.png|thumb|left|Population of Thebes from 2000-900 BC]]
According to [[George Modelski]], Thebes had about 40,000 inhabitants in 2000 BC (compared to 60,000 in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the largest city of the world at the time). By 1800 BC, the population of Memphis was down to about 30,000, making Thebes the largest city in Egypt at the time.&lt;ref&gt;George Modelski, &quot;[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html Cities of the Ancient World: An Inventory (−3500 to −1200)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232105/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html |date=2014-05-19 }}&quot;; see also [[list of largest cities throughout history]].&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] estimated that by 1500 BC, Thebes may have grown to be the largest city in the world, with a population of about 75,000, a position which it held until about 900 BC, when it was surpassed by [[Nimrud]] (among others).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Morris, &quot;[http://www.ianmorris.org/docs/social-development.pdf Social Development]&quot;; see also [[list of largest cities throughout history]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
The archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height.  The Greek poet [[Homer]] extolled the wealth of Thebes in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Book 9 (c. 8th Century BC): &quot;... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Culture===
More than sixty annual festivals were celebrated in Thebes. The major festivals among these according to the Edfu Geographical Text were: the [[Opet Festival|Beautiful Feast of Opet]], the Khoiak (Festival), Festival of I [[Shemu]], and Festival of II Shemu. Another popular festivity was the halloween-like [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==History==
===Old Kingdom===
[[File:SFEC AEH -ThebesNecropolis-2010-FULL-Overview-039.jpg|thumb|The Theban Necropolis]]
Thebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/egyptkarnak.htm Karnak (Thebes), Egypt]. Ancient-wisdom.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the fourth [[Upper Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]. At this time it was still a small trading post while [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] served as the royal residence of [[Old Kingdom]] pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than the portions of the Karnak temple complex, which may date from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]] of the [[5th Dynasty]] has been found in Karnak. Another statue which was dedicated by the [[12th Dynasty]] king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th]] to [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th]] Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area which dated to the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/thebes.htm Egypt: Thebes, A Feature Tour Egypt Story]. http://www.touregypt.net/.

===First Intermediate Period===
By 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth]] Dynasties) consolidated [[Lower Egypt]] and northern parts of [[Upper Egypt]] from their capital in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. A rival line (the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]]) based at Thebes ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the [[iry-pat|prince]] of Thebes, [[Intef the Elder]]. His probable grandson [[Intef I]] was the first of the family to claim in life a partial [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.

===Middle Kingdom===
[[File:Intef I.jpg|thumbnail|thumbnail|140px|left|[[Serekh]] of Intef I inscribed posthumously for him by Mentuhotep II]]
Finally by c. 2050 BC, [[Intef III]]'s son [[Mentuhotep II]] (meaning &quot;Montu is satisfied&quot;), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the ''[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]''. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]], which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than 20 years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of [[Mentuhotep IV]], in mysterious circumstances.

During the [[12th Dynasty]], [[Amenemhat I]] moved the seat of power North to [[Itjtawy]]. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god [[Amun]] was increasingly becoming prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of [[Senusret I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom a town of considerable size. Excavations around the Karnak temple show that the Middle Kingdom town had the layout with a grid pattern. The city was at least one kilometer long and 50 hectares in area. Remains of two palatial buildings were also detected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry J. Kemp]]: ''Ancient Egypt, Anatomy of a Civilization'', Second Edition, New York 2006, {{ISBN|9780415235501}}, pp. 225-229&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the later part of the 12th Dynasty, a group of [[Canaan]]ite people began settling in the eastern Nile Delta. They eventually founded the [[Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt|14th Dynasty]] at [[Avaris]] in c. 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC. By doing so, the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region, subtracting these territories from the influence of the [[13th Dynasty]] that had meanwhile succeeded the 12th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilkinson |first= Toby |authorlink= Toby Wilkinson |date=2011 |title= The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&amp;id=P07rgiJjsk4C&amp;q=nehesy#v=snippet&amp;q=nehesy&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher= Random House |page=560 |isbn=9780747599494 }}, pp. 183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Intermediate Period===
[[File:Beni Hassan (Lepsius, BH 3) 03.jpg|thumbnail|right|Depiction of Asiatic (left) and Egyptian people (right). The Asiatic leader is labeled as &quot;Ruler of foreign lands&quot;, Ibsha.]]
A second wave of [[Asian people|Asiatics]] called [[Hyksos]] (from ''Heqa-khasut'', &quot;rulers of foreign lands&quot; as Egyptians called their leaders) immigrated into Egypt and overran the Canaanite center of power at Avaris, starting the [[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]] there. The Hyksos kings gained the upper hand over Lower Egypt early into the [[Second Intermediate Period]] (1657-1549 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (2011), pp. 188 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hyksos took Memphis during or shortly after [[Merneferre Ay]]'s reign (c. 1700 BC), the rulers of the 13th Dynasty fled south to Thebes, which was restored as capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;bentor&quot;&gt;Daphna Ben Tor: ''Sequences and chronology of Second Intermediate Period royal-name scarabs, based on excavated series from Egypt and the Levant'', in: ''The Second Intermediate Period (Thirteenth-Seventeenth Dynasties), Current Research, Future Prospects'' edited by Marcel Maree, Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 192, 2010, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Theban princes (now known as the [[Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt|16th Dynasty]]) firmly stood over their immediate region as the Hyksos advanced from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] southwards to Middle Egypt. The Thebans resisted the Hyksos' further advance by forming an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able sail upstream past Thebes and some [[Cataracts of the Nile|Nile cataracts]] to trade with the [[Nubians]] and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] ([[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]]) insulted [[Seqenenre Tao]] ([[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]]) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son [[Kamose]] took charge of the campaign. After Kamose's death, his brother [[Ahmose I]] continued till he captured [[Avaris]], the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and the Levant and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bunson, &quot;[http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/142072/Bunson_-_Encyclopedia_of_ancient_Egypt.pdf Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom and height of Thebes===
[[File:Statues of Memnon at Thebes during the flood-David Roberts.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[Colossi of Memnon|Statues of Memnon]] at Thebes during the flood'' by David Roberts]]
[[Ahmose I]] founded a new age for a unified Egypt with Thebes as its capital. The city remained as capital during most of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ([[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). It also became the center for a newly established professional [[civil service]], where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. ''Egypt's Golden Empire: The Age of the New Kingdom'', pp. 18–19. Headline Book Publishing Ltd., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At the city the favored few of

[[File:Temple of amun karnak.jpg|thumbnail|right|Overhead illustration of the [[Karnak]] temple]]
With Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. For instance, [[Amenhotep III]], poured much of his vast wealth from foreign tribute into the temples of [[Amun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;Dorman, P.

Retrieved 2016-02-06, from http://www.ancient.eu/Thebes_(Egypt)/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thutmose I]] (reigned 1506-1493 BC) began the first great expansion of the [[Karnak]] temple. After this, colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom.

Queen [[Hatshepsut]] (reigned 1479-1458 BC) made the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks, primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes' Red Sea port of [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]], [[Eilat|Elat]] and the land of [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. Her successor [[Thutmose III]] brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far as [[Mittani]]. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his son [[Amenhotep III]]'s reign (1388–1350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|mortuary temple]] and the equally massive [[Malkata]] palace-city which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.

For a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III's son [[Akhenaten]] (1351–1334 BC), Thebes fell on evil times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of [[Amarna]] (Akhetaten), midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death, his son [[Tutankhamun]] made a return to Memphis,&lt;ref&gt;J. van Dijk: ''''The Amarna Period and the later New Kingdom'', in: I. Shaw: ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-815034-2}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; but renewed interest in building projects at Thebes which produced even more glorious temples and shrines.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:John Frederick Lewis - The Ramesseum at Thebes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|''The Ramesseum at Thebes'' by John Frederick Lewis]]
With the [[19th Dynasty]] the seat of government moved to the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of [[Seti I]] (1290–1279 BC) and [[Ramesses II]] (1279–1213 BC), who still resided for part of every year in Thebes.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city such as statues and obelisks, the third enclosure wall of [[Karnak]] temple, additions to the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple, and the [[Ramesseum]], his grand [[mortuary temple]]. The constructions were bankrolled by the large [[Granary|granaries]] (built around the Ramesseum) which concentrated the taxes collected from Upper Egypt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, T.

Under Ramesses' long 66-year reign, Egypt and Thebes reached an overwhelming state of prosperity which equaled or even surpassed the earlier peak under Amenhotep III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/treaty.htm Egypt: Ramses the Great, The Pharaoh Who Made Peace with his Enemies And the First Peace Treaty in History]. http://www.touregypt.net/.

The city continued to be well kept in the early [[20th Dynasty]]. The [[Papyrus Harris I|Great Harris Papyrus]] states that [[Ramesses III]] (reigned 1187–56) donated 86,486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the [[Sea Peoples]] and [[Meshwesh]] Libyans. However, the whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, exemplified in the events at Thebes' village of [[Deir el-Medina]]. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Consequently, an unsuccessful harem revolt led to the deaths of many, including Theban officials and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatdreams.com/thebes/ramiii.htm RAMESSES III: THE LAST GREAT PHARAOH]. http://www.greatdreams.com/. Retrieved on 2016-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the later Ramessids, Thebes began to decline; the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of [[Ramesses IX]] (1129–1111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in [[Deir el-Bahri]] and in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]]. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

===Third Intermediate Period===
Control of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priests of Amun]], so that during the [[Third Intermediate Period]], the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the [[21st Dynasty|21st]] and [[22nd Dynasty]] kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God’s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Karnak Taharkasäule 01.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A column of [[Taharqa]] restored to full height]]
By around 750 BC, the [[Kushites]] (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], the former colony of Egypt became an empire in itself. In 721 BC, King [[Shabaka]] of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of [[Osorkon IV]] ([[22nd Dynasty]]), [[Peftjauawybast]] ([[23rd Dynasty]]) [[Bakenranef]] ([[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]]) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In [[Karnak]] he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the [[Pschent]] (the double crown of Egypt). [[Taharqa]] accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.

===Late Period===
In 667 BC, attacked by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]'s army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) [[Tantamani]] seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed for these dates and statements|date=July 2016}} The Assyrians pursued him and took Thebes, whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health.&quot;{{citation needed|reason=where is this quote from?  It needs a citation.|date=July 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed [[Psamtik I]] (664-610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, [[Nitocris I]], as heiress to God's Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian [[Cambyses II]] invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a [[satrapy]] to the greater [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Graeco-Roman Period===
[[File:Temple of Deir el-Medina 18.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Relief in [[Hathor]] temple, Deir el-Medina (built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Dynasty]])]]
The good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by [[Alexander the Great]]. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the [[Opet Festival]]. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, [[Hugronaphor]] (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, [[Ankhmakis]], held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, [[Ptolemy V]], in need of the support of the priesthood, forgave them.

Half a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain [[Harsiesi]] to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/the_destruction_of_thebes.htm The fall of Thebes to the Assyrians and its decline thereafter]. http://www.reshafim.org.il/.

During the Roman occupation (30 BC-349 AD), the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of ''[[Thebais]]'', which later split into ''Thebais Superior'', centered at the city, and ''Thebais Inferior'', centered at [[Ptolemais Hermiou]]. A [[Roman legion]] was headquartered in Luxor temple at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;Dorman, P. (2015). &quot;Luxor&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 2016-02-27, from http://www.britannica.com/place/Luxor&lt;/ref&gt; Building did not come to an abrupt stop, but the city continued to decline. In the first century AD, [[Strabo]] described Thebes as having been relegated to a mere village.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

* '''[[Precinct of Amun-Re|Great Temple of Amun]] at Karnak''' (Ancient Egyptian ''Ta-opet''). Still the second largest religious building ever built, it is the main house of worship for [[Amun]], Thebes' patron deity, and the residence of the powerful [[High Priest of Amun|Amun priesthood]]. What differentiated it from the many temples of Egypt is the length of time it was built over (more than 2,000 years, starting in the Middle Kingdom). The main features of this temple are its ten large [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]s, the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]], a sacred lake, sub-temples, numerous shrines and multiple [[obelisk]]s. It was the most important temple for a majority of Ancient Egyptian [[History of Ancient Egypt|history]].
* '''[[Luxor Temple]]''' (''Ipet resyt''). Unlike the other temples in Thebes, it is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death. Instead, it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the [[pharaoh]]s of Egypt were crowned. It is a centerpiece of the &quot;Opet Festival&quot;, where the sacred [[barque]] of the [[Theban Triad]] travels from Karnak to Luxor temple highlighting the godly significance of the pharaoh's re-coronation .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9457">'''Kom el-Hisn''' ({{lang-ar|كوم الحصن}} ''{{transl|ar|Kawm el-Ḥiṣn}}'') is an [[Egypt]]ian [[Nile Delta]] settlement dating back to the [[Old Kingdom]] with parts dating to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. Its location in the 3rd [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]], or &quot;Estate of the Cattle&quot;, focus on the goddess [[Hathor]], as well as  faunal and textual evidence suggests it played a role in transporting cattle between regions. Whether or not it was a self-sufficient town or built solely to support the temple is currently unknown. 
The site’s main findings include the Tomb of Khesuwer, a large necropolis, and a temple dedicated to Sekhmet-Hathor. Inscriptions designating Hathor as the &quot;Mistress of Imu&quot;, among other similar inscriptions, and the location of Kom el-Hisn have given evidence to the site being the former nome capital '''Yamu''', or '''Imu'''. Much of the information on this site from previous excavations is lost or remains unpublished.

==Excavation history==
[[File:Egyptian - Relief with Hathor and King Necho II - Walters 22135.jpg|thumb|Relief with Hathor and pharaoh [[Necho II]], from Kom el-Hisn. [[Walters Art Museum]]]]
The site was initially uncovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] during his excavation at [[Naukratis]] in 1881. It was then surveyed by [[Francis Llewellyn Griffith]] from 1885 to 1887. This survey captured the remains of a mudbrick temple, enclosure wall, and four statues of [[Ramesses II]]. Two of these statues had inscriptions dedicating them to Sekhmet-Hathor, &quot;Mistress of Imu&quot;. The temple and enclosure wall have since been destroyed. Currently, two of the statues of Ramesses II are still at the site. One has been moved to the [[Cairo Museum]].

Another survey in 1902, this time by [[Georges Émile Jules Daressy|Georges Daressy]], found more artifacts related to Ramesses II with &quot;two broken colossi of [[Amenemhat III|Amenemhet III]] usurped by Ramsses II, an inscribed stone of Ramesside date, and four blocks from a chapel of Shoshenq II which had been usurped by Ramsses II&quot;.{{sfn|Kirby|Orel|Smith|1998|p=25}}&lt;br&gt;
In 1910 the Tomb of Khesuwer, a priest of Hathor, was found and excavated by C. Edgar. Within, a stone head of a [[12th Dynasty]] Pharaoh was found wearing the [[white crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. A damaged statue group of Amenemhat III was also found, possibly related to the broken colossi found earlier. This tomb cements the presence of a cult of Hathor at the site as well its possible religious function.

In the early 1940s, mudbrick tombs were uncovered after a heavy rainfall. El-Amir, Farad, and Hamada excavated what turned out to be a large necropolis from 1943 to 1949. There was a count of over one thousand graves ranging from lower to upper class burials. The most common were simple sand-pit burials. Among these, blades were found in a portion of the tombs labeled the “warrior group”, but most burials contained no or little grave goods.  The 1946 and 1948 excavations yielded a large number of &quot;pot-burials&quot; containing the remains of children. Among these, family tombs or mass graves were also found containing mostly children. They were identified the length of necklaces found with the remains.&lt;br&gt;
The exact number of graves is unknown. The majority date to the [[First Intermediate Period]] and Middle Kingdom. This excavation was not fully published and excluded a number of possible [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] graves.{{sfn|Orel|2000|p=39}} No maps or field notes from this excavation survive and much of what survives has remained unpublished.

A study of fauna and flora remains from residential deposits was completed in 1988. Considering the Nile Delta's historical association with cattle production, the small amount of cattle bones found suggests the site still had some affiliation with cattle production and the overall Estate, but not including butchering or raising cattle.{{sfn|Redding|1992|p=101}} A majority of their food appears to come from pigs, with remains indicating consumption of pigs outnumbering that of sheep and goats. This number suggests the site was not heavily involved in grain production. Cow bones found on the north end of the site suggests an animal necropolis, giving further evidence to the relation between the presence of the Hathor cult and involvement in the cattle production of the Nile Delta. This has not been excavated.

A series of excavations in 1984, 1986, and 1988 found remains of domestic architecture and materials, including an enclosure wall that had bordered much of the site. From these excavations came artifacts like bread molds and bowls that could be used for food storage, but the lack of basic items and the means to produce them suggests Kom el-Hisn was a religious settlement or ran under a governmental authority. During Robert J. Wenke’s excavation in 1988, he uncovered broken sealings and ceramics dating to the [[5th Dynasty|5th]] and [[6th Dynasty|6th]] dynasties. The site appears to have been a settlement occupied at least to the Middle Kingdom. Though the lack of basic domestic goods gives evidence to Kom el-Hisn being occupied by the Hathor cult and a small support staff for those priests.{{sfn|Cagle|2001|p=314}} This is again supported by Wenke’s excavation in 1988, where stone tools were found but leftovers from their manufacture were rare.{{sfn|Wenke|1988|p=28}} So far, no manufacturing workshops or evidence of such has been found, but Wenke stresses that it is still possible they existed but were removed from the main site.{{sfn|Wenke|1988|p=27}}

===Tomb of Khesuwer===
One of the first major findings at the site was the [[12th Dynasty]] limestone tomb of Khesuwer (&quot;Khesu the Elder&quot;). The remains were discovered on the south-west corner of Kom el-Hisn. It is the only tomb at the site containing inscriptions, which date to the Middle Kingdom. With these inscriptions and the basalt head found during the excavation, Edgar dates the tomb to the reign of Amenemhat III. Four [[foundation deposit]]s were found beneath the remains of two mudbrick walls found surrounding the tomb. Each contained a limestone plaque with an inscription containing his name that matched the one found inside the tomb. By the time of the tomb's discovery, the coffin and offering left behind had turned to dust. These deposits were placed as part of a ritual during the temple's construction so finding them beneath his tomb suggests of re-use of parts of the temple to build Khesuwer's tomb.&lt;br&gt;
One scene depicts Khesuwer and four rows of priestesses, who are clapping and playing instruments, giving evidence to his title as &quot;Overseer&quot; of the priestess' of Hathor.{{sfn|Sakr|2005|p=355}} It is assumed his office was that of the temple found at Kom el-Hisn.

==Yamu==
Yamu or Imu was a capital of the 3rd Nome of Lower Egypt. It is found in texts as early as the 5th Dynasty but the current location of the town is unknown. Due to the discovery of the inscription on the statues found at Kom el-Hisn, this site is thought to have been the location of Yamu.

Unpublished notes from Petrie's visit to the site in 1884 describe an offering table to the goddess [[Sekhmet]], with an inscription that reads &quot;the king gives an offering [to] the mistress of Yamu, Sekhmet&quot;.{{sfn|Cagle|2001|p=407}} He also reported other inscriptions detailing the &quot;mistress of Yamu&quot;, but is not specific about where he found them or if they refer to Kom el-Hisn. Though it is a strong theory that Yamu and Kom el-Hisn are the same, there is no concrete evidence to prove this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">'''Saft el-Hinna''' (also '''Saft el-Hinneh''', '''Saft el-Henna''', '''Saft el-Henneh''') is a village and an [[archaeological site]] in [[Egypt]]. It is located in the modern [[Al Sharqia Governorate]], in the  [[Nile Delta]], about 7 km southeast of [[Zagazig]].{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|p=125}}

The modern village of Saft el-Hinna lies on the [[ancient Egyptian]] town of '''Per-Sopdu''' or '''Pi-Sopt''', meaning &quot;House of Sopdu&quot;, which was the capital of the 20th [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] of [[Lower Egypt]] and one of the most important cult centers during the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]]. As the ancient name implies, the town was consecrated to [[Sopdu]], god of the eastern borders of Egypt.{{sfn|Shaw|Nicholson|1995|p=276}}{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|p=125}}

During the late [[Third Intermediate Period]], Per-Sopdu – called ''Pishaptu'' or ''Pisapti'', in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], by the [[Neo-Assyrian]] invaders – was the seat of one of the four ''Great chiefdom of the [[Meshwesh]]'', along with [[Mendes]], [[Sebennytos]] and [[Busiris (Lower Egypt)|Busiris]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=Table 22}}

==Excavations==
[[File:Naos Decades Grand Palais 08122006 05.jpg|thumb|220px|The reassembled “Naos of the Decades”, originally placed in the temple at Saft el-Hinna]]
In December 1884 Swiss [[Egyptologist]] [[Édouard Naville]] was performing a survey in the [[Wadi Tumilat]] on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]]. He went to Saft el-Hinna, a village of ''[[henna|hinna]]'' farmers, and here he found traces of the ancient city under the modern settlement. He believed to having found the ancient city of [[Phacusa]] in the Biblical [[Land of Goshen]], although it is nowadays assumed that Phacusa lies under the modern town of [[Faqous|Faqus]]. Even though the archaeological site was threatened by urban development and the expansion of crops, Naville managed to discover several monuments of pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]] of the [[30th Dynasty]], the perimeter walls of a temple, and other attestations dating to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman Egypt|Roman period]]s. Unfortunately, he never published a comprehensive excavation report.{{sfn|Naville|1887|pp=1–13}}{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|p=129}}&lt;br&gt;
Among the findings dated to Nectanebo I, Naville found a ''[[Naos (hieroglyph)|naos]]'' dedicated to Sodpu. It was later discovered that the ''naos'' was one of four, meant to be accommodated within the temple whose walls were found by Naville under Saft el-Hinna; the other three ''naoi'' were discovered as well, though in other places of the Delta and not ''[[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]]'': one dedicated to [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]], parts of which were found at [[Abukir]], and which is commonly called “Naos of the Decades”, one dedicated to [[Tefnut]], and a poorly preserved one which was discovered at [[Arish]]. All but the last one (due to its poor conservation) are surely attributable to Nectanebo I.{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|pp=127–9}}

In 1906 [[Flinders Petrie]] went to Saft el-Hinna to conduct an excavation aimed to discover evidence of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] presence in ancient Egypt. He soon found that the conditions of the site were even worse than the time of Naville. So he decided to dig in two undisturbed, neighboring areas, Kafr Sheikh Zikr and Suwa, which turn out to be two ancient ''[[Necropolis|necropoleis]]'' of Per-Sopdu. However, like Naville before him, Petrie never published a comprehensive report of these excavations.{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|p=130}}

Saft el-Hinna was later involved in two surface surveys, the ''[[Wadi Tumilat#Wadi Tumilat Project|Wadi Tumilat Project]]'' begun in 1977, and the ''[[Liverpool University]] Delta Survey'' (1983-85), the latter led by Steven Snape, who remarked that of the ruins described by Naville a century earlier, almost nothing is left.{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|p=131}}

By combining archaeological and [[Philology|phylological]] evidences, it is now known that the sacred area of Per-Sopdu was divided into two parts called ''Hut-nebes'' and ''Iat-nebes'', which were connected by a ''dromos''.{{sfn|Tiribilli|2012|pp=135–6}}

At '''[[Helwan]]''' south of modern [[Cairo]] was excavated a large [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cemetery with more than 10.000 burials. The cemetery was in use from the [[Naqada Period]] around 3200 BC to the Fourth Dynasty and again at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom and then up to the Roman Period and beyond. The burial ground was discovered and excavated by [[Zaki Saad]] in 1942 to 1954. Further excavations started in 1997 by an Australian expedition.&lt;ref&gt;E. Christiana Köhler, Jana Jones: ''Helwan II, The Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom Funerary Relief Slabs'', Studien zur Archäologie und Geschichte Altägyptens, Band 25, Rahden 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-86757-971-1}}, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations of Zaki Saad were never fully published, only several preliminary reports appeared. Helwan was most likely the cemetery of Memphis in the first Dynasties. The tombs range from small pits to bigger elaborated [[mastaba]]s. Regarding the underground parts of these tombs, two types are attested. There are on one side pits with the burial at the bottom and there are on the other side underground chambers, reached via a pit or via a staircase. The majority of burials are for one deceased. There are some examples of multiple burials. The deceased were mostly place in reed mats or coffins of different materials. Most of the bodies were found in a contracted position. Most tombs were built of mud bricks. Roofs are often made of timber. Some walls in the underground chambers were covered with plaster. In several tombs stones were found, used for roofing the tomb chamber, for blocking the entrance and in rare cases for paving walls. Some of the more elaborate tombs had several underground chambers. These chambers were often reached via a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;E. Christiana Köhler: ''The Helwan Cemetery'', in: ''Archeo-Nil'', 18 (2008), pp. 114-122&lt;/ref&gt; The people buried here belonged to all levels of society, albeit the highest officials were buried at [[Saqqara]]. Over 40 stelae were found belonging to the upper levels of society.  They are an important source for early writing in Egypt. A certain [[Meriiti]] bears many titles on his stela and dates moast likely to the First Dynasty. A few stelae also belong to members of the royal family, such as the ''king's daughter'' [[Satkhnum]], the ''king's daughter'' [[Khenmetptah]] and the ''king's son'' [[Nisuheqet]]. The stela date from about the middle of the First Dynasty to the early Fourth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;E.

'''Bir Kiseiba''' is a [[Neolithic]] archaeological site in Egypt, dating from approximately 11,000 - 5,000 BP, that lies approximately 250km west of the Nile in [[Lower Nubia]]. Excavated by [[Fred Wendorf]], Romauld Schild, and Angela Close, Bir Kiseiba, along with [[Nabta Playa]], has some of the earliest evidence for food production, permanent settlement, and more diverse technologies as compared to sites from the [[Late Pleistocene]]. Wendorf and associates argue that cattle and pottery were here as early as any other place in Africa, although this assertion has been challenged.

== Archaeology ==
Most of the studies in the Bir Kiseiba region relate to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] when there was a wet period from about 11-10,000 BP until 5000 BP. There were two digging seasons at Bir Kiseiba, one in 1979 and the second in 1980. A total of 13 localities were excavated, scattered among four [[Dry lake|playas]] in the Bir Kiseiba region.

Occupations from throughout the Early Holocene were studied; however, the most emphasis was put on earlier sites occupied before 6500 BP due to limited resources, the locations of many later sites along the margins of the basins, previous studies had already been done at the later sites, and only the earlier sites could provide data related to the appearance of cattle to the [[Sahara]]. The earliest known settlements in the area have been radiocarbon dated to between 9800 and 8900 BP.  Artifacts from these settlements yielded the remains of cattle and also sherds of pottery with designs distantly related to the Early Khartoum styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cattle-keepers of the Eastern Sahara: The neolithic of Bir Kiseiba|last=Wendorf, Fred, Romauld Schild, and Angela E. Close, eds.|first=|publisher=Department of Anthropology and Institute for the Study of Earth and Man|year=1984|isbn=|location=Southern Methodist University|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faunal Remains''' 

Many faunal remains were found at each site and include turtles, lizards, frogs, birds, desert hedgehogs, hares, lesser gerbils, striped ground squirrels, elephants, dorcas gazelle, and large bovids that Wendorf and colleagues believed to be domestic cattle. 

The [[Bovidae|bovid]] remains were of particular interest. Taking into account the context in which these remains were found, the remains could be from wild cattle (''[[Bos primigenius]]''), [[Cattle|domestic cattle]] (''B.primigenius'' f. taurus), [[African buffalo]] (''[[African buffalo|Syncerus caffer]]''), or a giant buffalo species belonging to the genus ''[[Pelorovis]]''. Unfortunately the specimens at Bir Kiseiba were not well preserved enough for comparative analysis. However, by referring to the size of the found remains, it is unlikely that the material comes from giant buffalo. The measurements do suggest that these animals were at least as large as wild cattle, but there is not enough information of the sexual dimorphism in size of these animals. Overall the size range of the bovid remains includes large domestic cattle and smaller wild cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

'''Pottery'''

During the Late Neolithic period (ca. 5100-4700 BC), smooth ceramic ware appeared at Bir Kiseiba, some of which was black-topped, similar to the characteristic ware of the early Predynastic period in the Nile Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|last=Bard|first=Kathryn|publisher=Blackwell Pub|year=2007|isbn=|location=Malden, MA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 300 ceramic [[Sherd|sherds]] were found at the sites at Bir Kiseiba. There were no whole or reconstructable vessels found at any site.The surface colors of the sherds ranged from reds, to dark reds, to yellow-reds, yellow-browns, dark browns, and gray-browns. The core colors varied from reds, red-browns, dark browns, and very dark gray-browns. The colors of the ceramics suggest that they were fired in [[oxidizing]] atmospheres. Most of the vessels seem to have been constructed using a coiling technique and many were decorated with various motifs, the most common being the Woven Mat motif. The [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblages]] found at Bir Kiseiba are very similar to the Middle Neolithic assemblages found at Nabta Playa, and both fall within the Khartoum Horizon Style of ceramics.

There were 3 different techniques used to decorate the ceramics: impression, incision, and punctation. Impression was the most common, being used to produce several motifs. The most common motif consists of continuous impressions made with a square or rectangular-toothed comb, or possibly the serrated edge of a shell. This results in a motif that looks similar to basketry and is fittingly called Woven Mat.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  

'''Settlements'''  

There are not enough data to make definitive statements about the early settlements that may have existed in the Bir Kiseiba region; however, Wendorf and colleagues do make some observations.  

The earliest Holocene settlement sites are currently thought to be temporary camps only occupied in the time after the region's summer rains but before the periods of aridity. This is when there would be enough vegetation available for grazing populations, such as cattle and gazelles. The consistency of cattle bones points toward these small sites being temporary herding camps, where small groups of people would let their cattle graze and possibly hunt the other grazing animals found in the area, such as gazelles and hares.   

== Controversy ==
Twenty two cattle bones were found in the [[Nabta Playa]] - Bir Kiseiba area. Excavators argue that these bones are from [[domesticated cattle]], basing their claims on the reconstruction of the ecology showing conditions that were too poor to support large animals without human intervention, forming the basis of the Wendorf-Schild Model. Others have countered that an environment capable of sustaining gazelles and hares would have enough vegetation to support large animals like rhino and elephant, thus being able to support wild cattle as well. There is also no known ecological zone that contains only hares and gazelle, which suggests that faunal records of the area are fragmentary and incomplete.

Measurements of the bones from [[Nabta Playa]] and Bir Kiseiba morphologically have fallen within the range of [[aurochs]].

Mitochondrial DNA has also done little to support the Wendorf-Schild Model beyond showing that the wild ''[[Bos primigenius]]'' could be the primary source for early domesticated cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brass|first=Michael|date=2013-07-01|title=Revisiting a hoary chestnut: the nature of early cattle domestication in North-East Africa|journal=Sahara (Segrate, Italy)|volume=24|pages=65–70|issn=1120-5679|pmc=3783853|pmid=24077927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cave of the Beasts''' (also named ''Foggini-Mestikawi Cave'' or ''Foggini Cave'' or ''Cave Wadi Sura II'') is a huge natural rock shelter in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] of [[Geography of Egypt|Egypt]] featuring [[Neolithic]] [[rock paintings]], more than 7,000 years old, with about 5,000 figures.

== Geographical location ==
The shelter is located in the Wadi Sura at the south-western foot of the [[Gilf Kabir|Gilf Kebir]] Mountains in the remote south-western corner of [[Egypt|Egypt’s]] [[New Valley Governorate]] near the border of [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]]. The area, abandoned in the present day, is one of the most [[arid]] locations of the [[Sahara]].

== Discovery ==
The shelter was discovered in 2002 by archaeologists Massimo and Jacopo Foggini and Ahmed Mestikawi. In 2010 scientists of the [[University of Cologne]] carried out an in-depth study of the shelter and called it Wadi Sura II to distinguish it from the [[Cave of Swimmers]] (Wadi Sura I) located some {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} further east.

== Age and paleo-climatology ==
The rock paintings were created more than 7000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;J.-L. Le Quellec, P. + P. Flers: ''Du Sahara au Nil: ...'' Paris 2005, S. VI.&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the [[Neolithic age]]. At that time the Sahara’s climate was humid. In the [[Holocene]] period there was a lake at the foot of the shelter. At the end of the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] 6000 years ago, the climate pattern changed to arid&lt;ref&gt;According to Linstädter/Kröpelin 2004 first the monsoon rainfalls withdrew to south and subsequently Mediterranean rainfalls disappeared leading to gradual [[desertification]] of the area.&lt;/ref&gt; and the area was depopulated.

== Description ==
The shelter is {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and almost {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and contains over 5,000 well-preserved figures painted with red, yellow, white and black pigments. Hundreds of hand and foot [[stencil]] are over-painted with groups of human creatures and [[therianthropy|therianthropic]] and [[acephaly|acephalic]] [[mythological creatures]]. Whereas the symbolism of the [[hand stencils]] can be found in many [[cave painting]]s all over the world, the beasts are unique. The shelter is upwardly topped off by [[rock engraving]]s.

In February 2016 a report in the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' concluded that what had been considered to be human hand stencils &quot;differ significantly in size, proportions and morphology from human hands&quot;  and were more likely made by a reptile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honoré|first1=Emmanuelle|last2=Rakza|first2=Thameur|last3=Senut|first3=Brigitte|last4=Deruelle|first4=Philippe|last5=Pouydebat|first5=Emmanuelle|title=First identification of non-human stencil hands at Wadi Sūra II (Egypt): A morphometric study for new insights into rock art symbolism|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|date=April 2016|volume=6|pages=242–247|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the beasts were intentionally disfigured in prehistoric times. Always surrounded by human creatures, the beasts catch the eye due to their body size and shape: Long tailed, bull-like body, frequently three footed with human-like legs. Even headless they appear either to spit or to swallow human creatures.

&lt;gallery class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Image:Bestias4.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Hand stencils over-painted with groups human beings&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Bestias2.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Dancing human beings over-painted with yellow pigmented creatures&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Bestias6.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Rock engravings of gazelles on top of the shelter&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some of the beasts seem to be wrapped in a kind of golden net.&lt;ref&gt;Drawing on archaeological finds in south-western Turkey, Lewis-Williams/Pearce 2005 concluded that the reference to a &quot;sub-aquatic nether world&quot; (in: ''Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos, and the Realm of the Gods''. London 2005, p. 111) and to [[theriocephaly|theriocephalic]] figures (ibid. p. 115-115)  are integral components of the [[iconography]] of the emerging Neolithic age.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the shelter is covered with groups of dancing, floating or swimming human creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Some scenes appear to be trivial immediately denied by the appearance of the beasts (J.-L. Le Quellec, P. + P. Flers: ''Du Sahara au Nil: ... Paris 2005'', S. 90).&lt;/ref&gt; On the lower left edge of the shelter appear two groups of human creatures separated from each other by a rock crack. The ones above the rock crack are holding a sling over his head, while the ones below the crack have a hand above their heads and are all looking all to the left.

Scattered throughout the shelter appear wild animals: An [[elephant]], [[ostrich]]es, [[gazelle]]s, and [[giraffe]]s. Along with the beasts the figures of the shelter represent a mythological world whose [[symbol]]ism has not been deciphered yet.

New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished under the patronage of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, with collections of works, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and gardens. Alexandria was considered the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Pub.|year=|isbn=9781616084530|location=New York, NY|pages=p. 17|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Musaeum of Alexandria]], where many of the most famous thinkers of the ancient world studied.

The library was created by [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who was a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] general and the successor of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). ''The library: An illustrated history''. Chicago, IL: Skyhorse Publishing, (pp. 15).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the books were kept as [[papyrus]] scrolls. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.

Arguably, this library is most famous for [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|having been burned down]] resulting in the loss of many scrolls and books; its destruction has become a symbol for the loss of cultural knowledge. Sources differ on who was responsible for its destruction and when it occurred. The library may in truth have suffered several fires over many years. In addition to fires, at least one earthquake damaged the city and the library during this time. &lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria include a fire set by the army of [[Julius Caesar]] in 48 BC and an attack by [[Aurelian]] in the 270s AD.

After the main library was destroyed, scholars used a &quot;daughter library&quot; in a temple known as the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], located in another part of the city. According to [[Socrates of Constantinople]], [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] destroyed the Serapeum in AD 391, although it is not certain what it contained or if it contained any significant fraction of the documents that were in the main library. 

==Structure==
The exact layout of the library is not known, but ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, Greek columns, a {{wikt-lang|en|Peripatetic|peripatos}} walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls, creating a model for the modern university campus.{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=26}} The library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department (possibly built near the stacks, or for utility closer to the harbor) and a cataloguing department. A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known as ''bibliothekai'' (''βιβλιοθῆκαι''). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read: ''The place of the cure of the soul.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberto2008&quot;&gt;Manguel, Alberto, The Library at Night. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The library was but one part of the [[Musaeum|Musaeum of Alexandria]], which functioned as a sort of research institute. In addition to the library, the Musaeum included rooms for the study of astronomy, anatomy, and even a zoo containing exotic animals. The classical thinkers who studied, wrote, and experimented at the Musaeum include the great names of philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, physics, geometry, engineering, geography, physiology, and medicine. These included notable thinkers such as [[Euclid]], [[Archimedes]], [[Eratosthenes]], [[Herophilus]], [[Erasistratus]], [[Hipparchus]], [[Aedesia]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], [[Hypatia]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ldolphin.org/mouseion.html|title=The Great Library of Alexandria|work=ldolphin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Ptolemy II MAN Napoli Inv5600.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]], excavated at the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]

It is not possible to determine the collection's size in any era with certainty. [[Papyrus]] scrolls constituted the collection, and although [[codex|codices]] were used after 300 BC, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to [[parchment]], perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. (The Library of Alexandria in fact was indirectly causal in the creation of writing on parchment&amp;nbsp;— due to the library's critical need for papyrus, little was exported and thus an alternate source of copy material became essential.)&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained &quot;books&quot; was a major aspect of editorial work. King [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (309–246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library.&lt;ref&gt;Tarn, W.W. 1928. Ptolemy II. ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', 14(3/4), 246–260. The Byzantine writer [[Tzetzes]] gives a similar figure in his essay [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poets.html#lycophron2 On Comedy].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Antony]] supposedly gave [[Cleopatra]] over 200,000 scrolls for the library as a wedding gift, taken from the great [[Library of Pergamum]], but this is regarded by some historians as a propagandist claim meant to show Antony's allegiance to Egypt rather than Rome.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Roy, ''The Library of Alexandria: Center of Learning in the Ancient World,'' New York:I.B Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The library's index, [[Callimachus]]' [[Pinakes]], was lost with the rest of the library, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. At its height, the library was said to possess nearly half a million scrolls, and, although historians debate the precise number, the highest estimates claim 400,000 scrolls while the most conservative estimates are as low as 40,000, which is still an enormous collection that required vast storage space. This library, with the largest holdings of the age, acquired its collection by laborious copying of originals. [[Galen]] spoke of how all ships visiting the city were obliged to surrender their books for immediate copying. The owners received a copy while the pharaohs kept the originals in the library within their museum.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009-07-27|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=}}

As a research institution, the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards were applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious [[textual criticism]]. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity. Once ascertained, canonical copies would then be made for scholars, royalty, and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy1999&quot; /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alexandria Library Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|This Latin inscription regarding [[Tiberius Claudius Balbilus]] of Rome (d. c. AD 79) mentions the &quot;ALEXANDRINA BYBLIOTHECE&quot; (line eight).]]
The library was arguably one of the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|libraries of the ancient world]], but details about it are a mixture of history and legend.{{sfn|MacLeod|2004|pp=1–}} Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David C. Lindberg|title=Science in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=15 March 1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|MacLeod|2004|pp=1–}}

According to the earliest source of information, the [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''[[Letter of Aristeas]]'' composed between c.180 and 145 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg1980&quot;/&gt; the library was initially organized by [[Demetrius Phalereus|Demetrius of Phaleron]],&lt;ref&gt;''Letter of Aristeas'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/aristeas1.html#9 9–12].&lt;/ref&gt; a student of [[Aristotle]], under the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (c.323 BC—c.283 BC). Other sources claim it was instead created under the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in the style of Aristotle's [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], adjacent to (and in service of) the [[Musaeum]] (a Greek Temple or &quot;House of Muses&quot;, whence the term &quot;museum&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 Μουσείον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library at Alexandria was in charge of collecting all the world's knowledge, and most of the staff was occupied with the task of translating works onto papyrus paper.{{sfn|MacLeod|2004|pp=1–}} It did so through an aggressive and well-funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of [[Rhodes]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Erksine, Andrew. 1995. &quot;Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: The Museum and Library of Alexandria&quot;. ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd ser., 42(1), 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Galen]], any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library,{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} and were listed as &quot;''books of the ships''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galen&quot;&gt;[[Galen]], xvii.a, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.606 p.606].&lt;/ref&gt; Official scribes then copied these writings; the originals were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galen&quot;/&gt; Other than collecting works from the past, the library served as home to a host of international scholars, well-patronized by the Ptolemaic dynasty with travel, lodging, and stipends for their whole families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy1999&quot;&gt;Kennedy, George.''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism:Classical Criticism,''New York: University of Cambridge Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Galen, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original scripts of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] ({{convert|1000|lbs|kg|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) of a precious metal as guarantee. Ptolemy III happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galen]], xvii.a, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html#1.607 p.607].&lt;/ref&gt; This story may also be construed erroneously to show the power of Alexandria over Athens during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}}

The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on [[Homer]]ic texts. The more famous editors generally also held the title of [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]]. These included [[Zenodotus]], [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Eratosthenes]], [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Whibley, Leonard; ''A Companion to Greek Studies'' 1916 pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; (While [[Callimachus]]—the first bibliographer and developer of the &quot;[[Pinakes]]&quot;, which is popularly considered the first library catalog—did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he was never the head librarian there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staikos, 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Konstantinos Sp.

===Destruction===
{{main|Destruction of the Library of Alexandria}}

The burning of the Library of Alexandria, including the incalculable loss of ancient works, has become a symbol of the irretrievable loss of public knowledge. Although there is a mythology of &quot;''the'' burning of the Library at Alexandria&quot;, the library may have suffered several fires or acts of destruction of varying degrees over many years. Ancient and modern sources identify several possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;StoryofLibraries&quot;&gt;{{Citation

During [[Caesar's Civil War]], [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|besieged at Alexandria]] in 48 BC. Many ancient sources describe Caesar setting fire to his own ships&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Justin, and Reid, Howard. 2006.

The library seems to have continued in existence to some degree until its contents were largely lost during the taking of the city by the Emperor [[Aurelian]] (AD 270–275), who was suppressing a revolt by [[Zenobia|Queen Zenobia]] of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dope&quot;&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/malexanderlibrary.html Staff Report: &quot;What happened to the great Library of Alexandria?] ''The Straight Dope'', 6 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the fighting, the areas of the city in which the main library was located were damaged.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Some sources claim that the smaller library located at the Serapeum survived,{{sfn|Gibbon|1776–1789|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap28.htm ch. 28]}} though [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote of the library in the Serapeum temple as a thing of the past, destroyed when Caesar sacked Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ammianus |last=Marcellinus|chapter=[[s:Roman History/Book XXII#XVI|Roman History: book 22.16.12–13]] |title=Roman History|editor=[[Charles Duke Yonge|Yonge, C.D.]] |location=London |publisher=H.G.

In AD 642, Alexandria was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|captured by the Muslim army]] of [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of [[Caliph Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;De Sacy, ''Relation de l’Egypte par Abd al-Latif'', Paris, 1810: &quot;Above the column of the pillars is a dome supported by this column.

Pococke, p.181, translation on p.114. Online Latin text and English translation here [http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/?p=4936]. Latin: “Quod ad libros quorum mentionem fecisti: si in illis contineatur, quod cum libro Dei conveniat, in libro Dei [est] quod sufficiat absque illo; quod si in illis fuerit quod libro Dei repugnet, neutiquam est eo [nobis] opus, jube igitur e medio tolli.” Jussit ergo Amrus Ebno’lAs dispergi eos per balnea Alexandriae, atque illis calefaciendis comburi; ita spatio semestri consumpti sunt. Audi quid factum fuerit et mirare.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers.&lt;ref&gt;E. Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', chapter 51: &quot;It would be endless to enumerate the moderns who have wondered and believed, but I may distinguish with honour the rational scepticism of Renaudot, (Hist.

John the Grammarian appears to be John Philoponus, who must have been dead by the time of the conquest. It seems, as shown above, that both of the Alexandrian libraries were destroyed by the end of the fourth century, and there is no mention of any library surviving at Alexandria in the Christian literature of the centuries following that date. It is also suspicious that Omar is recorded to have made the same remark about books found by the Arab during their conquest of Iran.&quot;}}

==Legacy==

Although the various component parts of the physical library were destroyed, in fact the centres of academic excellence had already moved to various capital cities. Furthermore, it is possible that most of the material from the Library of Alexandria actually survived, by way of the [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]], the [[Academy of Gondishapur]], and the [[House of Wisdom]]. This material may then have been preserved by the [[Reconquista]], which led to the formation of [[Medieval university|European Universities]] and the [[Research library#Renaissance|recompilation of ancient texts]] from formerly scattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00j0q53|title=BBC UK radio program In Our Time: The Library of Alexandria |editor=Melvin Bragg|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 2002, the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] functions as a modern library and cultural center, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibalex.org/en/Page/About|title=About the BA - Bibliotheca Alexandrina|website=www.bibalex.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qustul''' is an archaeological [[cemetery]] located on the eastern bank of the [[Nile]] in [[Lower Nubia]], just opposite of [[Ballana]] near the [[Sudan]] frontier. The site has archaeological records from the [[A-Group culture]], the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] and the [[X-Group culture]].

''Qustul'' has been flooded by [[Lake Nasser]].

== A-Group records ==
Three significant A-group culture cemeteries of the times of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt]] have been excavated. The most important one, cemetery L, revealed wealthy burials of rulers. In one of these graves was found an incense burner believed by Bruce Williams of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago depicting images assigned to the Pharaoh including a shape he believes to be the [[Hedjet|White Crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/nubia/qustul-incense-burner More info about the Qustul Incense Burner] retrieved 30 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== X-Group records ==
{{Further|Ballana}}
A necropolis of the [[X-Group culture|X-Group]] excavated by [[Walter Emery]] in 1931-1933 features large grave tumulae with bed burials for the kings with funeral sacrifices of horses, horse trappings and servants from the fourth to the sixth century CE. The royal nature of the burials is confirmed by the presence of bodies which were still wearing their crowns at the time of their discovevery.&lt;ref&gt;Derek A.

Smith: ''Walter Bryan Emery'', The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol.57 (1971), pp.190-201&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[Egyptologist]] born in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. Before his career in [[Egyptology]] began, he was introduced into the study of [[marine engineering]] where he became an excellent draftsman, which resulted in the brilliantly executed line drawings that permeated his later published works on Egyptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.alice.it/francescoraf/hesyra/Emery.htm|publisher=Francesco Raffaele|year=1999|title=Saqqara|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of six years in the British Army during the Second World War, followed by four years in the Diplomatic Service at [[Cairo]] in [[Egypt]], his entire life was devoted to the excavation of archaeological sites along the [[Nile Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Archaic Egypt 1963&quot;&gt;Archaic Egypt (bio), Walter B.

[[File:A post-Meroitic era Nubian royal crown from Ballana Tomb 118 by John Campana.jpg|thumb|The crown of a local [[Nubian kings|Nubian king]] who ruled between the collapse of the [[Meroitic period|Meroitic dynasty]] in 350 or 400 AD and the founding of the  [[Nubia#Christian Nubia|Christian kingdom of Nubia]] in 600 AD. It was found in Tomb 118 at [[Ballana]] in Lower Nubia by Emery]]
After preliminary training at the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology, he went to Egypt for the first time as an assistant on the staff of the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] expedition in 1923. There he aided in the excavation of [[Amarna]] (the ancient city in [[Middle Egypt]] founded by the pharaoh [[Akhenaton]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Archaic Egypt 1963&quot;/&gt;

By 1924, he was already field director of Sir Robert Mond's excavations at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] for the [[University of Liverpool]]. He made several clearings, restorations and protective operations into a score of tombs at Sheikh Abd el-Gurnah. Between 1924 and 1928, continuing as Director of the Mond Expedition, he worked on excavations at [[Nubia]], [[Luxor]] and Thebes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnsu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/emery_walter.html|title=Walter Bryan Emery|publisher=Minnesota State University Museum|author=Katherine Tumer|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 he was appointed field director of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia under the auspices of the Egyptian Government Service of Antiquities, with authority to explore and excavate all ancient sites in [[Nubia]] which were soon to be flooded after the erection of the [[Aswan Low Dam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;saqqara.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saqqara.nl/context/profiles/emery|title=Walter Bryan Emery|publisher=Profiles|author=Saqqare Online|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working at Quban, [[Ballana]] and [[Qustul]], he excavated the [[X-Group]] of tombs dating to the 3rd to 6th century A.D. He was assisted in his work by his wife, Molly.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnsu.edu&quot;/&gt; The completion of the excavations of the fortress at [[Buhen]] ended his work in Nubia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archaic Egypt 1963&quot;/&gt;

He then became director of fieldwork at Luxor and [[Armant]]. During the years 1935 to 1939 he was the director of the Archaeological Survey of Nubia. During these years as director, Emery also investigated several early dynastic tombs at [[Saqqara]]. While at Saqqara he made the significant discovery of a &quot;zoo&quot; of mummified animal remains. In 1937, Emery also discovered a disc-shaped object referred to as the ''Schist Disc'' (aka the Egyptian Tri-Lobed Disc) while excavating the burial chamber of the Tomb of Prince Sabu, son of Adjuib Pharaoh, governor of the I Dynasty (3,000 B.C.). The object has been on display to the public on the first floor of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, labelled as ''Vase of schist''.

Following the years of interruption by the war and his service as a diplomat, Emery worked in the [[Sudan]] ([[Buhen]], [[Qasr Ibrim]]). In 1964, he returned once more to Saqqara where he discovered the &quot;enclosure of the sacred animals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;saqqara.nl&quot;/&gt; 

Emery obtained the Chair of Egyptology at [[University College London]] in 1951, and was a professor of Egyptology in London from 1951 to 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnsu.edu&quot;/&gt; He was elected to the [[British Academy]] Fellowship in 1959. His principal publications are ''Great tombs of the 1st dynasty'', (3 volumes) 1949-58; ''Archaic Egypt'', 1961; and ''Egypt in Nubia'', 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgarycoin.com/reference/egypt/egyptian.htm|title=Archaic Egyptian Art|publisher=R &amp; T Enterprises Ltd.|date=1997–2004|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery died in March 1971.

'''Buhen''' was an [[ancient Egyptian]] settlement situated on the West bank of the Nile below (to the North of) the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] in what is now [[Northern state, Sudan|Northern State]], [[Sudan]]. On the East bank, across the river, there was another ancient settlement, where the town of [[Wadi Halfa]] now stands.

== Old Kingdom ==
In the Old Kingdom (about 2686–2181 BC) it was the site of a small trading post in [[Nubia]] that was also used for copper working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/buhen/index.html Buhen] University College London&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement may have been established during the reign of [[Sneferu]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]). Nevertheless, there is evidence of still earlier, 2nd dynasty, occupation at Buhen.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Yare, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030415212255/http://www.yare.org/essays/fortresses.htm The Middle Kingdom Egyptian Fortresses in Nubia.] 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drower, Margaret 1970: ''Nubia, A Drowning Land'', London, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaeological investigation in 1962 revealed what was described as an ancient copper 'factory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3821897|jstor=3821897|title=A Possible Source of Copper Ore Fragments Found at the Old Kingdom Town of Buhen|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=75|pages=31|year=1989|last1=Gayar|first1=El Sayed El|last2=Jones|first2=M. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graffito (archaeology)|Graffiti]] and other inscribed items from the site show that the Egyptians stayed about 200 years, until late in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th dynasty]], when they were probably forced out by immigration from the south.

== Fortress ==
Buhen is known for its large [[fortress]], probably constructed during the rule of [[Senusret III]] in around 1860 BC ([[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]]).

[[Senusret III]] conducted four campaigns into [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and established a line of forts within signalling distance of one another; Buhen was the northernmost of these. The other forts along the banks were [[Mirgissa]], [[Shalfak]], [[Uronarti]], [[Askut]], [[Dabenarti]], [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]], and [[Kumma (Nubia)|Kumma]]. The Kushites captured Buhen during the [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|13th dynasty]], and held it until [[Ahmose I]] recaptured it at the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It was stormed and recaptured by indigenous forces at the end of Egypt's [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]].

The fortress itself extended more than {{convert|150|m|ft}} along the west bank of the Nile. It covered {{convert|13000|m2|ft2}}, and had within its wall a small town laid out in a grid system. At its peak it probably had a population of around 3500 people. The fortress also included the administration for the whole fortified region of the Second Cataract. Its fortifications included a moat three metres deep, [[drawbridge]]s, [[bastion]]s, [[buttress]]es, [[Defensive wall|ramparts]], [[battlement]]s, [[loophole]]s, and a [[catapult]]. The walls of the fort were about {{convert|5|m|ft}} thick and {{convert|10|m|ft}} high.

The fortress at Buhen is now submerged under [[Lake Nasser]] as a result of the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1964. Before the site was covered with water, it was excavated by a team led by [[Walter Bryan Emery]].

Buhen had a temple of [[Horus]] built by [[Hatshepsut]], which was moved to the [[National Museum of Sudan]] in [[Khartoum]] prior to the flooding of [[Lake Nasser]].

The '''Abu Simbel temples''' are two massive rock [[Egyptian temple|temples]] at Abu Simbel ({{lang-ar|أبو سمبل}}), a village in [[Nubia]], southern [[Egypt]], near the border with [[Sudan]]. They are situated on the western bank of [[Lake Nasser]], about 230&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Aswan]] (about 300&amp;nbsp;km by road). The complex is part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] known as the &quot;Nubian Monuments&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/88|title=Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which run from Abu Simbel downriver to [[Philae]] (near Aswan). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century&amp;nbsp;BC, during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]] reign of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]]. They serve as a lasting monument to the king and his queen [[Nefertari]], and commemorate his victory at the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. Their huge external [[rock relief]] figures have become iconic.

The complex was [[Structure relocation|relocated]] in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the [[Aswan High Dam]] reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary or they would have been submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the [[Nile]] River.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
[[File:Abu Simbel ( 175 miles south of Aswan, left bank).jpg|alt=Geneva architect, Jean Jacquet, a Unesco expert, makes an architectural survey of the Great Temple of Rameses II ( 1290 - 1223 B.C.).|thumb|Geneva architect, Jean Jacquet, a Unesco expert, makes an architectural survey of the Great Temple of Rameses II ( 1290 - 1223 B.C.).]]
Construction of the temple complex started in approximately 1264 BC and lasted for about 20 years, until 1244 BC. Known as the &quot;Temple of Ramesses, beloved by [[Amun]]&quot; it was one of six rock temples erected in Nubia during the long reign of Ramesses&amp;nbsp;II. Their purpose was to impress Egypt's southern neighbours, and also to reinforce the status of Egyptian religion in the region. 

=== Rediscovery ===
With the passage of time, the temples fell into disuse and eventually became covered by sand. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when [[Switzerland|Swiss]] orientalist [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Jean-Louis Burckhardt]] found the top [[frieze]] of the main temple. Burckhardt talked about his discovery with [[Italy|Italian]] explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]], who travelled to the site, but was unable to dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding in his attempt to enter the complex. A detailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in [[Edward William Lane]]'s ''Description of Egypt'' (1825–1828).&lt;ref&gt;Lane E, &quot;Descriptions of Egypt,&quot; American University in Cairo Press. pp.493-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tour guides at the site relate the legend that 'Abu Simbel' was the name of a young local boy who guided these early re-discoverers to the site of the buried temple which he had seen from time to time in the shifting sands. Eventually, they named the complex after him.

=== Relocation ===

[[File:Collapsed Colossus.jpg|right|thumb|237px|The collapsed colossus of the Great Temple supposedly fell during an earthquake shortly after its construction. On moving the temple, it was decided to leave it as the face is missing.]]
In 1959, an international donations campaign to save the [[monument]]s of [[Nubia]] began: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilization were under threat from the rising waters of the Nile that were about to result from the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].

One scheme to save the temples was based on an idea by [[William MacQuitty]] to build a clear fresh water dam around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile. There were to be underwater viewing chambers. In 1962 the idea was made into a proposal by architects [[Jane Drew]] and [[Maxwell Fry]] and civil engineer [[Ove Arup]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fry Drew Knight Creamer'', 1978, London, Lund Humphries&lt;/ref&gt; They considered that raising the temples ignored the effect of erosion of the sandstone by desert winds. However the proposal, though acknowledged to be extremely elegant, was rejected.

The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964 by a multinational team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working together under the [[UNESCO]] banner; it cost some USD $40 million at the time (equal to $300 million in 2017 dollars). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 meters higher and 200 meters back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Terence (1966). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CFMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 The Race to Save Abu Simbel Is Won.] [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], December 2, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex.

The complex consists of two temples. The larger one is dedicated to [[Ra]]-Harakhty, [[Ptah]] and [[Amun]], Egypt's three state deities of the time, and features four large statues of Ramesses&amp;nbsp;II in the facade. The smaller temple is dedicated to the goddess [[Hathor]], personified by [[Nefertari]], Ramesses's most beloved of his many wives.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Stephanie (2008). ''Ramses II: Egyptian Pharaoh, Warrior and Builder.'' New York: Compass Point Books. {{ISBN|978-0-7565-3836-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple is now open to the public.

=== Great Temple ===

[[File:S10.08 Abu Simbel, image 9500.jpg|thumbnail|left|Human figures standing at the entrance to the Great Temple, sometime before 1923]]

The Great Temple at Abu Simbel, which took about twenty years to build, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BC). It was dedicated to the gods [[Amun]], [[Ra-Horakhty]], and [[Ptah]], as well as to the deified Rameses himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot;&gt;Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally considered the grandest and most beautiful of the temples commissioned during the reign of Rameses II, and one of the most beautiful in Egypt.

Four colossal 20 meter statues of the pharaoh with the double Atef crown of Upper and Lower Egypt decorate the facade of the temple, which is 35 meters wide and is topped by a frieze with 22 baboons, worshippers of the sun and flank the entrance.&lt;ref name=Skliar&gt;Ania Skliar, ''Grosse kulturen der welt-Ägypten'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Siliotti writes it's 33&amp;nbsp;m high and 38&amp;nbsp;m wide.--&gt; The colossal statues were sculptured directly from the rock in which the temple was located before it was moved. All statues represent Ramesses II, seated on a throne and wearing the [[pschent|double crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The statue to the left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake, leaving only the lower part of the statue still intact. The head and torso can still be seen at the statue's feet.

Next to the legs of the colossi, there are other statues no higher than the knees of the pharaoh.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; These depict [[Nefertari]], Ramesses's chief wife, and queen mother [[Queen Tuya|Mut-Tuy]], his first two sons [[Amun-her-khepeshef]], [[Ramesses B|Ramesses]], and his first six daughters [[Bintanath]], Baketmut, Nefertari, [[Meritamen]], [[Nebettawy]] and Isetnofret.

The entrance itself is crowned by a bas-relief representing two images of the king worshipping the [[falcon]]-headed Ra Harakhti, whose statue stands in a large niche.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; This god is holding the hieroglyph &quot;user&quot; and a feather in his right hand, with [[Ma'at]], (the goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this is nothing less than a gigantic cryptogram for Ramesses II's [[Fivefold Titulary#(Praenomen) He of the Sedge and the Bee|throne name]], User-Maat-Re. The facade is topped by a row of 22 [[baboon]]s, their arms raised in the air, supposedly worshipping the rising sun. Another notable feature of the facade is a [[Stela|stele]] which records the marriage of Ramesses with a daughter of king [[Hattusili III]], which sealed the peace between Egypt and the [[Hittite empire|Hittites]].

The inner part of the temple has the same triangular layout that most ancient Egyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from the entrance to the sanctuary. The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers. The [[hypostyle]] hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is 18 meters long and 16.7 meters wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deified Ramses linked to the god [[Osiris]], the god of the Underworld, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of [[Upper Egypt]], while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and [[Lower Egypt]] (pschent).&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; The bas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns the ruler waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the [[Battle of Kadesh]], on the Orontes river in present-day [[Syria]], in which the Egyptian king fought against the [[Hittites]].&lt;ref name=Skliar /&gt; The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=Skliar /&gt; Other scenes show Egyptian victories in [[Libya]] and Nubia.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;

From the hypostyle hall, one enters the second pillared hall, which has four pillars decorated with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. There are depictions of Ramesses and Nefertari with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra-Harakhti. This hall gives access to a transverse vestibule in the middle of which is the entrance to the sanctuary. Here, on a black wall, are rock cut sculptures of four seated figures: [[Ra-Horakhty]], the deified king Ramesses, and the gods [[Amun Ra]] and [[Ptah]]. [[Ra-Horakhty]], [[Amun Ra]] and [[Ptah]] were the main divinities in that period  and their cult centers were at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;

==== Solar alignment ====
It is believed that the axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that on October 22 and February 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of [[Ptah]], a god connected with the [[Underworld]], who always remained in the dark. People gather at Abu Simbel to witness this remarkable sight, on October 21 and February 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Skliar /&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2015}}

These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct evidence to support this. It is logical to assume, however, that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the [[pharaoh]]'s rule.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the [[heliacal rising]] of the star [[Sirius]] (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses the Great could take his place next to [[Amun Ra]] and Ra-Horakhty.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;

Due to the displacement of the temple and/or the accumulated drift of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] during the past 3,280 years, it is widely believed{{By whom|date=November 2015}} that each of these two events has moved one day closer to the Solstice, so they would be occurring on October 22 and February 20 (60 days before and 60 days after the Solstice, respectively).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==== Greek Graffito ====
A well-known graffito inscribed in Greek on the left leg of the colossal seated statue of [[Ramesses II]], on the south side of the entrance to the temple of the temple records that:

{{blockquote|&quot;When King Psammetichus (i.e., Psamtik II) came to Elephantine, this was written by those who sailed with Psammetichus the son of Theocles, and they came beyond Kerkis as far as the river permits. Those who spoke foreign tongues (Greek and Carians who also scratched their names on the monument) were led by [[Potasimto]], the Egyptians by Amasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/psamtik2.htm |title=king Psammetichus II (Psamtik II) |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Kerkis was located near the Fifth Cataract of the Nile &quot;which stood well within the Cushite Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica, p.756&quot;&gt;Britannica, p.756&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Small Temple ===
[[File:S10.08 Abu Simbel, image 9496.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Small Temple from below and left, before 1923]]
[[File:Abu Simbel Small temple 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Small Temple after relocation]]
The [[temple]] of [[Hathor]] and [[Nefertari]], also known as the Small Temple, was built about one hundred meters northeast of the temple of [[pharaoh]] Ramesses&amp;nbsp;II and was dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses&amp;nbsp;II's chief consort, Nefertari. This was in fact the second time in ancient [[Egyptian history]] that a temple was dedicated to a queen. The first time, Akhenaten dedicated a temple to his great royal wife, Nefertiti.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- what about Tiye's temple in Sedeinga?--&gt; The rock-cut facade is decorated with two groups of colossi that are separated by the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than ten meters high, are of the king and his queen. On either side of the portal are two statues of the king, wearing the [[white crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]] (south colossus) and the [[Pschent|double crown]] (north colossus); these are flanked by statues of the queen.

[[File:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The gods [[Set (mythology)|Set]] (left) and [[Horus]] (right) blessing Ramesses in the small temple at Abu Simbel]]
Remarkably, this is one of very few instances in [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] where the statues of the king and his consort have equal size.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great Temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as one faces the gateway) are, from left to right, princes [[Meryatum]] and Meryre, princesses [[Meritamen]] and Henuttawy, and princes Rahirwenemef and [[Amun-her-khepeshef]], while on the north side the same figures are in reverse order. The plan of the Small Temple is a simplified version of that of the Great Temple.

[[File:NefertariOfferingToHathor crop.jpg|thumb|Nefertari offering [[sistrum]]s to seated goddess [[Hathor]], frieze inside the Small Temple]]
As the larger temple dedicated to the king, the hypostyle hall or [[pronaos]] is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the [[sistrum]] (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the [[Deity|gods]] [[Horus]], [[Khnum]], [[Khonsu]], and [[Thoth]], and the [[goddess]]es Hathor, [[Isis]], [[Maat]], [[Mut]] of Asher, [[Satet|Satis]] and [[Taweret]]; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning [[incense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut.&lt;ref name=Skliar /&gt; The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting [[papyrus]] plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, Ramesses&amp;nbsp;II and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — [[Satet|Satis]], [[Anubis]] and Khnum.

The rock cut [[sanctuary]] and the two side chambers are connected to the transverse vestibule and are aligned with the axis of the temple. The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of [[Sacrifice|offerings]] to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the [[Great Royal Wife|queen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt; On the back wall, which lies to the west along the axis of the temple, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, seems to be coming out of the mountain: the goddess is depicted as the Mistress of the temple dedicated to her and to queen Nefertari, who is intimately linked to the goddess.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliotti&quot; /&gt;

Each temple had its own priest that represents the king in daily religious ceremonies. In theory, the Pharaoh would have been the only celebrant in daily religious ceremonies performed in different temples throughout Egypt. In reality, the high priest also played that role. To reach that position, an extensive education in art and science was necessary, like the one pharaoh had. Reading, writing, engineering, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, space measurement, time calculations, were all part of this learning. The priests of Heliopolis, for example, became guardians of sacred knowledge and earned the reputation of wise men.

The '''Temple of Debod'''&lt;ref&gt;Other spellings: Debot, Debout, Dabod or Dabud&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|'''Templo de Debod'''}}) is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] that was dismantled and rebuilt in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].
[[File:Francis Frith - The Temple of Dabod, Nubia.jpg|thumb|left|Temple of Debod in Egypt before relocation to Spain.]]
The shrine was originally erected {{convert|15|km}} south of [[Aswan]]&lt;ref name=arnold&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.64&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Upper Egypt]], very close to the first [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract of the Nile]] and to the great religious center in [[Philae]] dedicated to the goddess [[Isis]]. In the early 2nd century BC, [[Adikhalamani]] (Tabriqo), the Kushite king of [[Meroë]], started its construction by building a small single-room [[chapel]] dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Amun]].&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; It was built and decorated in a similar design to the later Meroitic chapel on which the [[Temple of Dakka]] is based.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; Later, during the reigns of [[Ptolemy VI]], [[Ptolemy VIII]], and [[Ptolemy XII]] of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], it was extended on all four sides to form a small temple, {{convert|12|x|15|m}}, which was dedicated to Isis of Philae. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] emperors [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] completed its decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

From the quay, there is a long processional way leading to the stone-built enclosure wall, through three stone pylon gateways, and finally to the temple itself.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; The pronaos, which had four columns with composite capitals, collapsed in 1868 and is now lost.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; Behind it lay the original sanctuary of Amun, the offering table room and a later sanctuary with several side-rooms and stairs to the roof.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt;
[[File:Templo de Debod, Madrid, España, 2014-12-27, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The current Temple of Debod in Madrid.]]
In 1960, due to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] and the consequent threat posed by its reservoir to numerous monuments and archeological sites, [[UNESCO]] made an international call to save this rich historical legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] World Heritage Committee, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of gratitude for the help provided by Spain in saving the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the Egyptian state donated the temple of Debod to Spain in 1968.

The temple was rebuilt in one of Madrid's parks, the [[Parque del Oeste]], near the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], and opened to the public in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; The reassembled gateways have been placed in a different order than when originally erected. Compared to a photo of the original site, the gateway topped by a serpent-flanked sun was not the closest gateway to the temple proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47d9-5ca3-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99|title=The Temple of Dabod, Nubia|website=NYPL Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It constitutes one of the few works of [[ancient Egyptian architecture]] that can be seen outside Egypt and the only one of its kind in Spain.

Classical sources from the Greco-Roman era, in Greek and in hieroglyphics, give Rhacotis as an older name for Alexandria before the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]]. 

Rhacotis was located west of the now-silted [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]]. Unlike ports within the [[Nile Delta]], it was reliably accessible to large ships, and enough water for a city could be supplied by a canal. It is also described as the home of sentinels who protected the Egyptian kingdom from outsiders.

== Etymology ==
The root of the name, ''[[wikt:qd|qd]]'', means &quot;construct&quot;. The prefix ''[[wikt:rꜥ|rꜥ]]'' could mean &quot;mouth&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;, &quot;entry&quot;, or the God [[Ra]], but as it can also be a morphological marker of ongoing action, a likely interpretation of the name as a whole is &quot;building site&quot; or &quot;construction in progress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Depauw, &quot;Alexandria, the Building Yard&quot;; ''Chronique d'Egypte'' 75(149), pp. 64–65. [[doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.309126]].&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Chaveau of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] argues that Rakhotis may simply have been the Egyptian name of the construction site for Alexandria;&lt;ref name=Chaveau /&gt; while [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]] contends that the style of the name and its linguistic context indicate that the name is older.&lt;ref&gt;John Baines, &quot;Possible implications of the Egyptian word for Alexandria&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'', Vol. 16 (2003), pp. 61–63. (Appendix to Judith McKenzie, &quot;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-archaeology/article/glimpsing-alexandria-from-archaeological-evidence/A95F62A34EE0CD1B091CAE0BFF0A757E Glimpsing Alexandria from archaeological evidence]&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical descriptions ==

The original city may have included the island of [[Pharos]], a harbor mentioned in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' as the kingdom of [[Proteus of Egypt|Proteus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Abdel-Fattah, &quot;The Question of the Presence of Pharaonic Antiquities in the City of Alexandria and its Neighboring Sites (Alexandria pre-Alexander the Great&quot;; in Hawass (2003), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pJ48YP14qZQC&amp;pg=PA63 63]–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch writes that this reference influenced Alexander in his decision to found a new capital at the harbor of Pharos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Alex.+26&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243 26]. &quot;Accordingly, he rose up at once and went to Pharos, which at that time was still an island, a little above the Canobic mouth of the Nile, but now it has been joined to the mainland by a causeway. And when he saw a site of surpassing natural advantages (for it is a strip of land like enough to a broad isthmus extending between a great lagoon and a stretch of sea which terminates in a large harbour), he said he saw now that Homer was not only admirable in other ways, but also a very wise architect, and ordered the plan of the city to be drawn in conformity with this site.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, &quot;[https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/16217/000.%20alexander%20in%20africa%20final%20pdf%20(ogden).pdf?sequence=2 Alexander and Africa (332–331 BC and beyond) : the facts, the traditions and the problems]&quot;; ''Acta Classica'' supplement 5, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest text from Alexandria, a hieroglyphic &quot;[[satrap]]&quot; stela from the month of [[Thout]] in 311 BC, refers to R-qd as the preceding name of the city.&lt;ref name=Chaveau&gt;Michel Chaveau, &quot;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/keryl_1275-6229_1999_act_9_1_993 Alexandrie et Rhakôtis: Le Point de Vue des Égyptiens]&quot;; in ''[http://www.persee.fr/issue/keryl_1275-6229_1999_act_9_1 Alexandrie : une mégapole cosmopolite]'' (Proceedings of ninth colloquium at Villa Kérylos, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, 2–3 October 1998); ''Cahiers de la Villa Kérylos'' 9); Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmed Kamal (Egyptologist)|Ahmed Bey Kamal]], ''Catalogue Général des Antiquités Égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Nos. 22001–22208: Stèles Prolemaiques et Romaines''. Cairo: L'Institut Franćais d'Archéologie Orientale, 1905; Cairo Museum #22182, p. [https://archive.org/stream/KamalStelesTexte1905/Kamal_St%C3%A8les_Texte_1905#page/n177/mode/2up 168].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]], in his description of Alexandria, describes Rhacotis as the home of Egyptian sentinels guarding the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D17%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D6 XVII.1.6]. &quot;The former kings of Egypt, satisfied with what they possessed, and not desirous of foreign commerce, entertained a dislike to all mariners, especially the Greeks (who, on account of the poverty of their own country, ravaged and coveted the property of other nations), and stationed a guard here, who had orders to keep off all persons who approached. To the guard was assigned as a place of residence the spot called Rhacotis, which is now a part of the city of Alexandreia, situated above the arsenal. At that time, however, it was a village. The country about the village was given up to herdsmen, who were also able (from their numbers) to prevent strangers from entering the country.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaveau /&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions Rhacotes as the former name of the site of Alexandria. &lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D11 V.11]. &quot;With the greatest justice, however, we may lavish our praises upon Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great on the shores of the Egyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa, at twelve miles' distance from the Canopic Mouth and near Lake Mareotis25; the spot having previously borne the name of Rhacotes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alexandria was planned by [[Dinocrates]], an experienced [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[architect]] and city planner from [[Rhodes]], who modeled the new city after the [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Hellenistic architectural style]] popular in the Greek world at the time.  The existing small village of Rhacotis, then a fishing port, became the Egyptian quarter of the city, located on the West side.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sabottka, Kathrin Machinek, &amp; Colin Clement, &quot;[https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01443120/document Le Serapeum d’Alexandrie – Résumé]&quot;; [[Institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale]]. Das Serapeum in Alexandria. Untersuchungen zur Architektur und Baugeschichte des Heiligtums von der frühen  ptolemäischen Zeit biszur Zerstörung. ''Etudes Alexandrines'' (15), pp.XI-XIII, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians may have continued to refer to the whole city as Rhakotis, and in some cases resented its existence.&lt;ref name=Chaveau /&gt;

[[Tacitus]] relates a story of the Egyptian priests that [[Ptolemy I]], seeking a blessing for the construction of Alexandria, received instructions to obtain a certain statue from the temple of &quot;infernal Jupiter&quot; ([[Pluto]]) in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (on the northern coast of modern [[Turkey]], along the [[Black Sea]]). First they visit the oracle [[Pythia]] at [[Delphi]], who confirms they are to remove the statue, but not its female companion ([[Proserpina]]). When they reach King [[Scydrothemis]] at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], they find him reluctant to part with the statue. The god then leaves the temple of his own will and conveys the party back to Alexandria, where a new temple is established at Rhacotis—the historical site of a temple to [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', 4.83–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0080%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D84 84]. &quot;A temple, proportioned to the grandeur of the city, was erected in a place called Rhacotis, where there had stood a chapel consecrated in old times to Serapis and Isis.&quot; See also [[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'', &quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/moralia/isis_and_osiris*/b.html §28].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==

Continuing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbour of Alexandria has revealed details of Rhakotis before the arrival of Alexander. In 1916, while preparing construction of a new port, French engineer [[Gaston Jondet]] found a sophisticated ancient port facility west of Pharos. [[Kamal Abu el-Saadat]] continued research in the 1960s with a pioneering submarine archaeology campaign which found more ruins and a 25-ton statue fragment. Another campaign began in the 1990s under the supervision of [[Franck Goddio]], finding numerous artifacts including twelve sphinxes, some apparently removed from [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] by the Ptolemies.&lt;ref&gt;Victor V. Lebedinsky, &quot;The Potential of Egyptian–Russian Cooperation in Underwater Archaeology: An Historical Perspective&quot;; in Hawass (2003), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1E13DorsFMEC&amp;pg=PA289 289].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood pilings and planks dated chemically and stratigraphically to c. 400 BC, and potsherds dated to 1000 BC, have been recovered from Alexandria's eastern harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Daniel Stanley, Thomas F. Jorstad, &amp; [[Franck Goddio]], &quot;[http://www.geologi.no/~geolosnt/images/NJG_articles/60713_NGT_no_3_06_19.pdf Human impact on sediment mass movement and submergence of ancient sites in the two harbours of Alexandria, Egypt]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&quot;; ''Norwegian Journal of Geology'' 86(3), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley2007&gt;Jean-Daniel Stanley et al., &quot;Alexandria, Egypt, before Alexander the Great: A multidisciplinary approach yields rich discoveries&quot;; ''GSA Today'' 17 (8), August 2007; [[doi:10.1130/GSAT01708A.1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent chemical analysis of artifacts found in the harbor has discovered high levels of lead in the [[third millennium BC]], peaking circa the turn of the [[23rd century BC]] ([[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]), and again near the turn of the [[first millennium BC]] ([[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] and [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth]] dynasties), as well as in the Hellenic era following the conquest of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;A. Véron, J. P. Goiran, C. Morhange, N. Marriner, &amp; J. Y. Empereur, &quot;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/2006GL025824/full Pollutant lead reveals the pre-Hellenistic occupation and ancient growth of Alexandria, Egypt]&quot;; ''Geophysical Research Letters'' 33(6), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanley2007 /&gt; They also suggest an expansive trade network including metal imports from [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Alain J. Véron et al., &quot;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A_Veron/publication/257231823_A_7000-year_geochemical_record_of_human_activities_from_Alexandria_Egypt/links/0c960535776ccd3fd5000000/A-7000-year-geochemical-record-of-human-activities-from-Alexandria-Egypt.pdf A 6000-year geochemical record of human activities from Alexandria (Egypt)]&quot;; ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 81, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some or all of the remains of Rhacotis may lie beneath the densely populated modern city of Alexandria, and thus remain off limits to archaeologists. No attempts to date have discovered remains of an early city in the Alexandrine neighborhood with the same name.&lt;ref name=Stanley2007 /&gt;

== Significance ==
The importance of Rhacotis remains a matter of debate. If the Rhacotis was indeed no more than a building yard, it may have been an inconsequential part of the Egyptian civilization before the arrival of Hellenic invaders.&lt;ref name=Chaveau /&gt;

[[Afrocentric]] historians such as [[George G. M. James]] and [[Molefi Kete Asante]] have argued that the city was great prior to the arrival of Alexander, and that [[Western civilization]] has appropriated an African cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Molefi Kete Asante]], &quot;Afrocentric theory rooted in proven facts: Attackers deny obvious to bolster racist notions&quot;; ''Philadelphia Tribune'', 17 May 1996. &quot;The City of Alexandria built in honor of Alexander of Macedonia was not a new city, the Greeks simply expanded an existing city and changed its name. The ancient Egyptian city of Rhacotis, which probably had an even older name, was the original African city upon which Alexandria was built much like Kinshasa under the Belgians was expanded and change to Leopoldville.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pi-Sekhemkheperre''' or '''Per-Sekhemkheperre''', was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian stronghold. Its name means ''&quot;The estate of Sekhemkheperre&quot;'', a reference to [[Osorkon I|Sekhemkheperre Osorkon I]], the pharaoh of the early [[22nd Dynasty]] who founded the fortress during his reign (about 922 to 887 BCE).{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=§ 263}} It has been suggested that its erection may be a symptom of the state of general insecurity in the country during the period.{{sfn|Aston|2005|p=66}}&lt;br/&gt;
Pi-Sekhemkheperre is at yet [[lost city|undiscovered]]{{sfn|Aston|2005|p=66}} but it is believed that it lies somewhere at the entrance of the [[Faiyum]], just north to [[Herakleopolis Magna]] in [[Middle Egypt]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=§ 263}}

The first known &quot;Chief of Pi-Sekhemkheperre&quot; was [[Nimlot C]] – a son of the 22nd Dynasty pharaoh [[Osorkon II]] – who also ruled the neighbouring city of Herakleopolis.{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=§ 263}} Shortly after Nimlot's rule, it appears that the fortress shifted allegiance to the rival [[23rd Dynasty]]: it is known that an official named Ewelhon was &quot;Chief of Pi-Sekhemkheperre&quot; in [[regnal year]] 6 of pharaoh [[Pedubast I]];{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=§ 300}} still later, the same office was held by the pharaoh-to-be [[Takelot III]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1996|p=§ 313}}&lt;br/&gt;
During the [[Nubia]]n invasion of the [[Nile valley]] led by pharaoh [[Piye]] of the [[25th Dynasty]], Pi-Sekhemkheperre was loyal to the &quot;Chief of the [[Meshwesh|Ma]]&quot; [[Tefnakht]] and his coalition. As stated on his ''Victory stela'', Piye found the stronghold garrisoned but was able to obtain its surrender without bloodshed, also capturing Tefnakht's son in the process.{{sfn|Breasted|1906|p=§§ 816ff}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3341">'''Sumenu''' or '''Smenu''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''S(w)mnw'') was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian town located in [[Upper Egypt]]. It housed the most prominent early-[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] sanctuary of the crocodile-god [[Sobek]].&lt;ref name=betro91&gt;Betrò, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==
[[File:GD-EG-Louxor-123-2.JPG|thumb|Pair statue of Sobek and [[Amenhotep III]], once housed in the temple of Sobek at Sumenu, and unearthed in the near village of Dahamsha]]
Uncertainties about the exact location of the city – tentatively identified with [[Gebelein]] or with Rizeiqat, the latter location being suggested by [[Gaston Maspero]]&lt;ref&gt;Betrò, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; – seem to have been resolved thanks to archaeological excavations started in the late 1960s, which finally allowed to identify Sumenu with the modern town of Al-Mahamid Qibly, located between [[Armant]] and Gebelein.&lt;ref name=betro91/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It is almost certain that Sumenu has to be identified with '''Imiotru''' (''ʼIwmìtrw'') and thus also with the '''Crocodilopolis''' (''Κροκοδείλων πόλις'') which was distinct from the one in the [[Faiyum]] and, according to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', was located between Hermonthis (Armant) and Aphroditopolis (Gebelein).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geographica'', XVII, 47&lt;/ref&gt; It appears most likely that Sumenu was the [[toponym]] where the temple stood, while Imiotru/Crocodilopolis referred to the whole city; in later times, the &quot;Sumenu&quot; denomination became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Betrò, pp. 94-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Earliest attestations of Sumenu dates back to the [[11th Dynasty]], and consist in references of a temple of &quot;Sobek, lord of Sumenu&quot;, indirectly attesting that such temple was already existing at the time.&lt;ref name=betro91/&gt; [[Jean Yoyotte]] suggested that the flourishing of the cult of Sobek during the Middle Kingdom was due to the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] origin of the [[12th Dynasty]] kings rather than their interest in the Faiyum region where Sobek was later associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jean|last=Yoyotte|authorlink=Jean Yoyotte|year=1957|title=Le Soukhos de la Maréotide et d'autres cultes régionaux du dieu-crocodile d'après les cilindres de Moyen Empire|journal=BIFAO|p=94|url=|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, objects referring to Sobek of Sumenu became quite common during the early Middle Kingdom, and was only with [[Amenemhat III]] that the cult of Sobek at Sumenu lost its appeal in favor of “Sobek of [[Crocodilopolis|Shedet]]”, the Greek ''Crocodilopolis'', located northward in the Faiyum.&lt;ref name=betro91/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The temple survived into the [[New Kingdom]], when several pharaohs of the [[18th Dynasty]] ordered works here,&lt;ref&gt;Betrò, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; then gradually phased out in later times. Soon after 88 BCE, the temple was demolished and its materials reused in the nearby city of [[El-Tod|Tod]].&lt;ref&gt;Betrò, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pi-Ramesses''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɪər|.|ɑː|m|ɛ|s}}); ([[Ancient Egyptian]] ''[[Per (hieroglyph)|Per]]-Ra-mes(i)-su'', meaning &quot;House of Ramesses&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyldesley|first=Joyce|title=Ramesses: Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh|publisher=Penguin|date=October 30, 2001|isbn=978-0-14-028097-5|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the new capital built by the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]] (1279–1213 BC) at [[Qantir]], near the old site of [[Avaris]]. The city had served as a summer palace under [[Seti I]] (c. 1290–1279 BC), and may have been founded by [[Ramesses I]] (c. 1292–1290 BC) while he served under [[Horemheb]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Lower Egypt-en.png|thumb|Map of Lower Egypt showing [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]] and [[Avaris]], near Pi-Ramesses]]
In 1884, [[Flinders Petrie]] arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations there. His first dig was at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], where he arrived with 170 workmen. Later in the 1930s, the ruins at Tanis were explored by [[Pierre Montet]].

The masses of broken Ramesside stonework at Tanis led archaeologists to identify it as Pi-Ramesses. Yet it eventually came to be recognised that none of these monuments and inscriptions originated at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seters&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzQe_4Waz34C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Land+That+I+Will+Show+You:+Essays+in+History+and+Archaeology+of+the+Ancient+Near+East&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jjp2Y0h3Sz&amp;sig=jauEX7cJJ8_AIVgGe9KfjDjYQzg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IQbxS-OzIpCTkAXp59HWBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Land that I Will Show You: Essays on the History and Archaeology of the Ancient Near East in Honor of J.

In the 1960s [[Manfred Bietak]], recognised that Pi-Ramesses was known to have been located on the then easternmost branch of the Nile. He painstakingly mapped all the branches of the ancient Delta and established that the Pelusiac branch was the easternmost during Ramesses' reign while the Tanitic branch (i.e. the branch on which Tanis was located) did not exist at all. Excavations were therefore begun at the site of the highest Ramesside pottery location, Tell el-Dab'a and Qantir.

Although there were no traces of any previous habitation visible on the surface, discoveries soon identified Tell el-Dab'a as the [[Hyksos]] capital [[Avaris]]. Qantir was recognized as the site of the Ramesside capital Pi-Ramesses.&lt;ref&gt;Nile Delta: a review of depositional environments and geological history. [[Geological Society of London]], Special Publications; 1989; v. 41; p. 99-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Qantir/Pi-Ramesses lies some 30 kilometers to the south of Tanis; Tell el-Dab´a, the site of Avaris, is situated about 2&amp;nbsp;km south of Qantir.&lt;ref name=Seters /&gt;

In 2017, archaeologists from the [[Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim|Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum]] unearthed footprints of children at the bottom of a mortar part,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhistorian.com/new-discovery-shows-children-always-played-mud/8102/ &quot;New Discovery Shows Children Have Always Played in the Mud&quot;], Ginger Perales. New Historian. February 27, 2017. Retrieved 2 mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well as pieces of painted wall, possibly [[fresco]] pending further study, believed to have served as decoration at the site of a palace or temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartnewspaper.com/news/children-s-footprints-and-painted-murals-preserved-at-site-linked-to-biblical-exodus/ &quot;Children’s footprints and painted murals preserved at site linked to Biblical exodus&quot;], Garry Shaw. The Art Newspaper. February 14, 2017. Retrieved 2 mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ramesses II was born and raised in the area, and family connections may have played a part in his decision to move his capital so far north;  but geopolitical reasons may have been of greater importance, as Pi-Ramesses was much closer to the Egyptian vassal states in [[New Kingdom|Asia]] and to the border with the hostile [[Hittite empire]]. Intelligence and diplomats would reach the pharaoh much more quickly, and the main corps of the army were also encamped in the city and could quickly be mobilised to deal with incursions of Hittites or [[Shasu]] nomads from across the [[Jordan River|Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;Manley, Bill (1995), &quot;The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Egypt&quot; (Penguin, Harmondsworth)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pi-Ramesses was built on the banks of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile. With a population of over 300,000, it was one of the largest cities of ancient Egypt. Pi-Ramesses flourished for more than a century after Ramesses' death, and poems were written about its splendour. According to the latest estimates, the city was spread over about {{convert|18|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or around {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. Its layout, as shown by [[ground-penetrating radar]], consisted of a huge central temple, a large precinct of mansions bordering the river in the west set in a rigid grid pattern of streets, and a disorderly collection of houses and workshops in the east. The palace of Ramesses is believed to lie beneath the modern village of Qantir. An Austrian team of archaeologists headed by Manfred Bietak, who discovered the site, found evidence of many canals and lakes and have described the city as the [[Venice]] of Egypt. A surprising discovery in the excavated stables were small [[cistern]]s located adjacent to each of the estimated 460 horse tether points. Using [[mule]]s, which are the same size as the horses of Ramesses' day, it was found a double tethered horse would naturally use the cistern as a [[toilet]] leaving the stable floor clean and dry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitchen, op. cit., p.255&quot;/&gt;

It was originally thought the demise of Egyptian authority abroad during the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt]] made the city less significant, leading to its abandonment as a royal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, pp.255–256&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the Pelusiac branch of the Nile began silting up c. 1060 BCE, leaving the city without water when the river eventually established a new course to the west now called the Tanitic branch. [http://www.tingroom.com/lesson/flcs/67971.html] The [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt]] moved the city to the new branch establishing Djanet (Tanis) on its banks, {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of Pi-Ramesses as the new capital of Lower Egypt. The Pharaohs of the Twenty-first Dynasty transported all the old Ramesside temples, obelisks, stelae, statues and sphinxes from Pi-Ramesses to the new site. The obelisks and statues, the largest weighing over 200 tons, were transported in one piece while major buildings were dismantled into sections and reassembled at Tanis. Stone from the less important buildings was reused and recycled for the creation of new temples and buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitchen, op. cit., p.255&quot;&gt;K. A. Kitchen.

==Biblical Ramesses==
The biblical [[Book of Exodus]] mentions &quot;Ramesses&quot; as one of the cities on whose construction the Israelites were forced to labour ({{bibleverse||Exodus|1:11|KJV|}}) and from where they departed on their Exodus journey ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:37|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Numbers|33:3|KJV|}}). Understandably, this Ramesses was identified by biblical archaeologists{{who|date=June 2017}} of the nineteenth century with the Pi-Ramesses of Ramesses II. Still earlier, the 10th-century Bible exegete Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], believed that the biblical site of Ramesses had to be identified with [[Ain Shams]].&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon, ''Judeo Arabic Translation of Pentateuch'' (''Tafsir''), s.v. Exodus 21:37 and Numbers 33:3 (&quot;רעמסס: &quot;עין שמס); ''Rabbi Saadia Gaon's Commentaries on the Torah'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1984, p. 164 (Numbers 33:3) (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; When the 21st Dynasty moved the capital to [[Tanis]], Pi-Ramesses was largely abandoned and the old capital became a quarry for ready-made monuments, but it was not forgotten: its name appears in a list of 21st Dynasty cities, and it had a revival under [[Shishaq]], usually identified with the historical pharaoh [[Shoshenq I]]&lt;ref&gt;Sagrillo, Troy Leiland. 2015. “Shoshenq I and biblical Šîšaq: A philological defense of their traditional equation.” In ''Solomon and Shishak: Current perspectives from archaeology, epigraphy, history and chronology; proceedings of the third BICANE colloquium held at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge 26–27 March, 2011'', edited by P.

&lt;/ref&gt; of the 22nd Dynasty (10th century BCE), who tried to emulate the achievements of Ramesses. The existence of the city as Egypt's capital as late as the 10th century BCE makes problematic the reference to Ramesses in the Exodus story as a memory of the era of Ramesses II; and indeed, the shortened form &quot;Ramesses&quot;, in place of the original Pi-Ramesses, is first found in 1st millennium BCE texts.&lt;ref name=Seters /&gt;

The Bible describes Ramesses as a &quot;store-city&quot;. The exact meaning of the Hebrew phrase is not certain, but some have suggested that it refers to supply depots on or near the frontier. This would be an appropriate description for [[Pithom]] (Tel El Maskhuta) in the 6th century BCE, but not for the royal capital in the time of Ramesses, when the nearest frontier was far off in the north of Syria. Only after the original royal function of Pi-Ramesses had been forgotten could the ruins have been re-interpreted as a fortress on Egypt's frontier.&lt;ref name=Seters /&gt;

'''Kom Firin''' is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Egypt]], located in the southwestern border of the [[Nile Delta]], just west of [[Kom el-Hisn]]. Most of the archaeological informations regarding the site were obtained from the 2002–2010 excavation campaign organized by the [[British Museum]] and led by Neal Spencer.&lt;ref name=snape292&gt;{{cite book |last=Snape|first=Steven|year=2014|title=The Complete Cities of Ancent Egypt|location=|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|ISBN=978-0-500-77240-9|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Earliest attestations of Kom Firin date back to the reign of [[Ramesses II]] of the [[19th Dynasty]], and it appears most likely that it was founded during this period as a [[fortified town]] against [[ancient Libya|Libyan]] incursions from the western border of Egypt. Its original Egyptian name has not been discovered yet.&lt;ref name=snape292/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A large (225 x 199 m), enclosure was unearthed in the eastern part of the site, and it is believed to be the remain of a fortified [[Ramesside]] temple. During the [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] the town underwent a significant remodelling and expansion, and so did the older [[New Kingdom]] enclosure, now surrounding a quadrupled area. Kom Firin's necropolis was possibly located in the nearby site of [[Silvagou]].&lt;ref name=snape292/&gt;

In later times, Kom Firin was progressively demolished by ''[[sebakh]]'' diggers. A prominent, modern feature of the site is the presence of pillars and pinnacles made of [[mudbricks]], and up to 10 m high, which are the result of the combined action of weather and ''sebakh''–digging on the ancient enclosure and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Snape, op. cit., pp. 292-3&lt;/ref&gt;
